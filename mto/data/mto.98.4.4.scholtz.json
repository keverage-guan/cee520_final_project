    "abstract": "Diatonic keyboard tunings in equal temperament, just intonation, meantone and well tempered scales are derived from Pythagorean tuning using algorithms whose operations involve combinations of pure fifths and syntonic commas. Graphic diagrams of the line of fifths are used to show the harmonic and mathematical relationships between common tunings and temperaments. Four modes of just intonation are derived from Pythagorean tuning by an algorithm that narrows each major third by one syntonic comma. Equal temperament is approximated with imperceptible error by algorithms that narrow Pythagorean and justly tuned enharmonic intervals by one or more syntonic commas.",

Thus, compared to just intonation,\nthe pitch of notes to the right of C will be painfully sharp and\nnotes to the left will be dismally flat.  For example, the major\nthird necessary for the diminished seventh chord will be 2s+1k\n(76 cents) broader than in a just scale while the minor sixth\nwill be 2s + 1k (49 cents) narrower. 18.

Helmholtz, On the Sensations of Tone , 453.  A similar \nlist of “Extended Just Tuning” is found in Blackwood, Recognizable Diatonic Tunings , 116–119. 23. Blackwood, Recognizable Diatonic Tunings , 74, demonstrates\nthat in a common progression of C-major triads from II to V, just\nintonation would require that D as the root of the II chord be\none syntonic comma lower in pitch than D as the fifth of the V\nchord.  In The Science of Musical Sound ( Scientific American\nBooks , 1983, 67), John Pierce shows a five chord\nprogression, I, IV, II, V, I, in which the just tuning of C drops\nby a syntonic comma from the first chord to the last. 24. It is for this reason that Lloyd in his article on Just\nIntonation in the 1954 Grove Dictionary adopted the position that\ninstruments without fixed pitch and vocalists use a flexible\nscale in which the size of the intervals vary according to the\ncontext and part of the reason that Lindley and Turner-Smith\nintroduced the concept of “leeway” into their algebraic tuning\ntheory. 25. Inspection of the chain of fifths tells us that a major\nthird can only generate one-quarter of the infinite series of\nchromatic notes that are generated by the fifth.  This is why the\ntuning of the major third is a subsidiary factor in the\ngeneration of diatonic scales. 26. Barbour, Tuning and Temperament , 26. 27.

Since the first \nreference to split keys found by Barbour goes back to 1484, this \ndevice must have been used for both Pythagorean and meantone \ntunings. 30. Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians , \n“Temperaments” (379). 31. Barbour’s table 24 gives a monochord mean-tone tuning derived\nby Gibelius in 1666 by arithmetic division of the comma which is\nthe same tuning shown in Figure 12.  Gibelius’s monochord is\ndivided into an octave between 216000 and 108000, in which G =\n144450, D = 193200 and A = 129200.  The equivalence of these\nmonochord tunings to Figure 12 is calculated as follows: G = 216000/144450 = 4320/2889 = 480/321 = 160/107\n     D = 216000/193200 = 540/483 = 180/161\n     A = 216000/129200 = 540/323 Barbour states that these approximations “check closely with\nnumbers obtained by taking roots,” with the G being off by\n0.000003.  Barbour, Tuning and Temperament , 29. 32. Barbour, Tuning and Temperament , 64. The syntonic comma is defined as the difference between the\nPythagorean tuning and just tuning of the major third.  The\ndifference between the just third (5/4) and the Pythagorean third\n(81/64) is 81/80, calculated as follows: 81/64 x 4/5 = 81/16 x\n1/5 = 81/80.  The syntonic comma is also the difference between\nthe Pythagorean and just tunings for all diatonic intervals other\nthan the fourth and fifth, which are the same in both tunings. \nThe reason for the repeated appearance of the syntonic comma will\nbe apparent from the discussion of the four modes of just\nintonation in section 5.

Lloyd’s diagrams in his articles in\nthe 1954 Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians on “Just \nIntonation” and “Temperaments.” Intervals measured by rational fractions can be converted\ninto cents using the following approximate values: octave = 1200\ncents, perfect fifth = 702 cents; Pythagorean comma = 24 cents;\nsyntonic comma = 22 cents. See Lindley and Turner-Smith, “An Algebraic Approach,” \nparagraph 4. In modern terminology, dividing the string in half gives two\noctaves, in thirds gives a fifth and an eleventh, and in fourths\ngives a fourth, octave and double octave.  The other diatonic\nnotes are then determined by calculating intervals of a fifth\nfrom these intervals.  This produces two diatonic octaves in\nPythagorean tuning. Perfect fifths do not combine to produce a perfect octave. \nThe nth fifth in a sequence of n fifths is defined mathematically\nby the expression (3/2)(n), which can never be an exact multiple\nof 2 since every power of 3 is an odd number.

No sequence of fourths can\ngenerate an octave because the inverse sequence of fifths can never do so. In logarithmic measure, a perfect fifth is 702 cents. \nTherefore twelve perfect fifths equals 8424 cents while seven\noctaves is 8400 cents.  The difference, the Pythagorean comma, is\ntherefore equal to 24 cents.

Helmholtz, On the Sensations of Tone , 453.  A similar \nlist of “Extended Just Tuning” is found in Blackwood, Recognizable Diatonic Tunings , 116–119. Blackwood, Recognizable Diatonic Tunings , 74, demonstrates\nthat in a common progression of C-major triads from II to V, just\nintonation would require that D as the root of the II chord be\none syntonic comma lower in pitch than D as the fifth of the V\nchord.  In The Science of Musical Sound ( Scientific American\nBooks , 1983, 67), John Pierce shows a five chord\nprogression, I, IV, II, V, I, in which the just tuning of C drops\nby a syntonic comma from the first chord to the last. It is for this reason that Lloyd in his article on Just\nIntonation in the 1954 Grove Dictionary adopted the position that\ninstruments without fixed pitch and vocalists use a flexible\nscale in which the size of the intervals vary according to the\ncontext and part of the reason that Lindley and Turner-Smith\nintroduced the concept of “leeway” into their algebraic tuning\ntheory. Inspection of the chain of fifths tells us that a major\nthird can only generate one-quarter of the infinite series of\nchromatic notes that are generated by the fifth.  This is why the\ntuning of the major third is a subsidiary factor in the\ngeneration of diatonic scales. Barbour, Tuning and Temperament , 26. Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1954), \n“Temperaments” (380). Dart, The Interpretation of Music (New York: Harper & Row, \n1963), 47. Barbour, Tuning and Temperament , 108–9.  Since the first \nreference to split keys found by Barbour goes back to 1484, this \ndevice must have been used for both Pythagorean and meantone \ntunings. Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians , \n“Temperaments” (379). Barbour’s table 24 gives a monochord mean-tone tuning derived\nby Gibelius in 1666 by arithmetic division of the comma which is\nthe same tuning shown in Figure 12.  Gibelius’s monochord is\ndivided into an octave between 216000 and 108000, in which G =\n144450, D = 193200 and A = 129200.  The equivalence of these\nmonochord tunings to Figure 12 is calculated as follows:\n\n     G = 216000/144450 = 4320/2889 = 480/321 = 160/107\n     D = 216000/193200 = 540/483 = 180/161\n     A = 216000/129200 = 540/323\n\nBarbour states that these approximations “check closely with\nnumbers obtained by taking roots,” with the G being off by\n0.000003.

(8) Figure 1 shows the central 21 links in the chain, with C at the origin. \nAll the notes in the chain are considered to be within a single\noctave bounded by two C’s.  Since fifths and fourths are\ninversions, each note is a fifth above the note to its left and a\nfourth above the note to its right.  As a matter of convention,\nit is useful to consider the links to the right of C to be \nascending fifths and the those to the left to be ascending fourths. The same seven letter names repeat themselves over and over in\nthe same invariant sequence of the C-major scale—F–C–G–D–A–E–B—with each repetition augmented by sharps to the\nright and flats to the left. Any group of six adjacent links\ndefines a major diatonic scale whose tonic note is one link from\nthe left end of the group, and a natural minor scale which starts\ntwo links from the right end.  Horizontal movement of any\nsix-link group is the equivalent of transposition of the scale\ninto a new key as exemplified by Figure 2 .  A twelve-note\nchromatic keyboard commonly contained the notes from E ♭ to G ♯ ,\nbefore the acceptance of equal temperament.  When all the\nfifths were pure, the keyboard would be suitable for the diatonic\nmajor and minor scales in the keys depicted in Figure 2.

The diatonic tuning that\nincludes both consonant thirds and pure fifths is known as just\nintonation.  One traditional method of forming a C-major scale in\njust intonation is to combine consonant tonic, dominant and\nsubdominant triads, F–A–C, C–E–G and G–B–D.

The multiplicity of alternate tunings makes\njust intonation even more impractical for the normal keyboard\nwith twelve keys to the octave.  It can also be seen from Figure 9 that the absolute location of\nthe syntonic comma moves but that its relative location is always\non the fourth link of the scale.  Each just scale could be\nconsidered to be virtually a separate entity whose tuning is\nfixed by the tuning of the triads that it contains.",

Each of the tunings we have discussed so far can\nbe derived from an algorithm for tuning the chain of fifths into\none 12-note chromatic octave on a keyboard.  The Pythagorean\ntuning algorithm has four steps: C is tuned to an arbitrary unit pitch of 1. Tune the pitch of each note to be a perfect fifth (3/2) from the notes immediately adjacent to it. If the pitch of any note is greater than 2, divide the pitch by 2 to keep it within the same octave. Stop after the 12 notes from E ♭ to G ♯ have been tuned. The equal temperament algorithm is the same as the Pythagorean\nalgorithm except that the interval in step 2 is 1/12 of a\nPythagorean comma narrower than a pure fifth.  Although justly\ntuned scales often have been considered to represent a different\nspecies from the Pythagorean or the equally tempered scale, we\nwill show in Figure 10 how an algorithm can be derived that maps\nPythagorean tuning into just chromatic scales.

This produces a chromatic scale in which the\ndiatonic scale of C-major is just and the maximum number of major\nthirds are a consonant 5/4.  This scale is generated by an\nalgorithm in which (1) the fourth link of a Pythagorean C-major\nscale is narrowed by a syntonic comma and (2) every fourth link\nabove and below that link is also narrowed by a syntonic comma. \nThe tuning of the just chromatic scale from E ♭ to G ♯ depicted in\nFigure 10 corresponds to the tuning given by Rossing for these\nsame 12 chromatic notes within a larger chromatic scale of just\nintonation from F ♭ to B ♯ . (15) We can use the graphic diagram in Figure 10 to evaluate the\ndifference between the just and Pythagorean pitch of each note\nwithout having to multiply out the 81/80 syntonic comma.  In this\njust chromatic scale, B ♭ and E ♭ are each a syntonic comma higher\nin pitch while justly tuned A, E, B and F ♯ are each a syntonic\ncomma lower in pitch.  Just C ♯ and G ♯ are lower than Pythagorean\nby two syntonic commas.  Examining Figure 10 demonstrates still\nmore reasons why a chromatic scale of just intonation is unusable\non a standard keyboard.  Narrowing every fourth link by a comma\ndoes not leave all the thirds and fifths consonant.  The fifths\nthat are narrowed (which means that the fourths are inversely\nbroadened) by a full syntonic comma are obviously dissonant.\nThus, the just chromatic scale has two more dissonant links than\na Pythagorean chromatic scale.  The wolf fifth from enharmonic D ♯ ( E ♭ ) to G ♯ will be narrowed by three syntonic commas.  Any\ngroup of three adjacent links that does not include a comma will\nform a Pythagorean minor third and a Pythagorean major sixth.\nWhole tones in this scale that include a syntonic comma are 10/9,\nwhile the other whole tones are in the just and Pythagorean\nproportion of 9/8.  To assess the severe impact of these tuning\ndiscrepancies we summarize the most significant consequences when\na keyboard tuned in just intonation as in Figure 10 is used to\nplay the six diatonic major scales listed in Figure 2. B ♭ -major: fifth of tonic triad narrowed by a syntonic comma. F-major: major fourth broadened by a syntonic comma. C-major: fifth of the II chord narrowed by a syntonic comma. G-major: fifth of the dominant triad narrowed by a comma. D-major: fifth of tonic triad narrowed by a syntonic comma. A-major: major fourth broadened by a syntonic comma. It is, thus, amply clear that just scales with consonant thirds\ncannot be meaningfully used on a chromatic keyboard. Figure 11 . The Four Modes of Just Intonation (click to enlarge)",

Substituting G, which is\nenharmonic to A ♭ ♭ +1k in syntonic ET, and reiterating the process,\nD in Syntonic ET would be 10 more links to the left of A ♭ ♭ plus\none more syntonic comma, giving D enharmonically equivalent to F ♭ ♭ ♭ +2k.  At the other end of the chain, enharmonic B ♭ in\nsyntonic ET would be 10 links minus one syntonic comma to the\nright of E ♯ -1k(F), written as B ♭ = G ♯ ♯ ♯ -2k.  Syntonic ET is based\nupon substitution of enharmonic pairs just as is equal\ntemperament.  The tuning of each note is exactly the same in both\nsyntonic and schismatic ET.  The notation and tuning for\nschismatic and syntonic ET are given in Figure 16 . The algorithm\nfor syntonic ET is as follows. Starting with C, move 10 links to the left to A ♭ ♭ + k.\n        Substitute G enharmonically for A ♭ ♭ +1k. Reiterate the action 5 more times, adding 1 syntonic\n        comma to the width of each 10-link interval.  Rename each note\n        enharmonically. Returning to C, move 10 links to the right of C to E ♯ -1k.\n        Substitute F enharmonically for E ♯ -1k.

                "text": "[8.5] We can now go a step further and derive the algorithm that\nmaps just intonation into syntonic ET from the algorithms\npreviously used to map Pythagorean tuning into just intonation. \nFor example, E ♯ in the just mode of C-major is equal to\nPythagorean E ♯ -3k.  Adding back the three syntonic commas, E ♯ -1k\nin schismatic and syntonic ET is enharmonically equivalent to E ♯ + 2k in the just C-major mode.  The algorithm for just schismatic\nET parallels the algorithm given in section 8.3, adding back to\neach interval the number of commas listed in Figure 11.  In\nsyntonic ET, B ♭ is enharmonically equivalent to G ♯ ♯ ♯ -2k.  If the\nC-mode just scale were extended to G ♯ ♯ ♯ , the Pythagorean tuning\nwould be narrowed by 5 syntonic commas.  Replacing the 5 commas, G ♯ ♯ ♯ +3k maps just G ♯ ♯ ♯ into B ♭ in just syntonic ET.  We have\nnot set out the full just chromatic scale for the 121 links\nnecessary in Figure 11, but it can be done simply by adding 1\nsyntonic comma for every four links to the left and subtracting 1\nsyntonic comma for every four links to the right as many times as\nis necessary.  Applying these algorithms in Figure 17 gives\nscales of just schismatic and just syntonic ET for the C-major\nscale.",

They do not merge all enharmonically equivalent\nnotes, as shown by the outer sections of Figure 16 which contains\nnotes from G ♭ to F ♯ in schismatic ET.  The enharmonic value for D ♭ is not exactly equal to the value of C ♯ as it is in equal\ntemperament and C is not exactly equal to D ♭ ♭ and B ♯ .  Therefore,\nthe number of possible notes is still endless and does not\ncollapse to twelve.  The divergences between the tunings produced\nby the two equal temperaments are of no audible or acoustic\nsignificance either to the tuning of individual notes or to the\noverall sound of the temperament.  A keyboard instrument tuned to\nsyntonic ET would not sound distinguishable from one tuned with\nunlikely mathematical perfection to traditional equal\ntemperament.  The twelve chromatic links tuned to syntonic ET\nwould have to be replicated nearly 163 times before the\ndivergence in tuning C would exceed even one schisma. 9. Concluding Thoughts",

                "text": "[9.1] This article has explored the relations between keyboard\ntunings based upon the chain of fifths.  We began by accepting\nthe historical definition of a diatonic scale embedded in a\n12-note chromatic keyboard.  We demonstrated that the terms used\nto name diatonic and chromatic intervals can be rationally\nordered according to the number of links between the intervals on\nthe chain of fifths.  We then derived algorithms that map\nPythagorean tuning into just intonation and equal temperament and\nmap just intonation into equal temperament.  Pythagorean tuning\nand just intonation have traditionally been classified as\ndistinct tuning strategies, while Pythagorean tuning and equal\ntemperament have been related only by the Pythagorean comma. \nThis article has shown that the three tunings can be related\nusing algorithms that utilize combinations of pure fifths and\nsyntonic commas.

The table lists the author of the\ntemperament, the date of its publication, the chromatic\ncompass of the tuning on the chain of fifths, and the number\nof intervals which are pure or are altered by one or more\ncommas, starting at the left end of the chain. 81.
