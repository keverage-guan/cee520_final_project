Agmon asserts that, in\npractice, the distinction between these two concepts is based upon\nperceptual differences within melodic and chordal contexts—octave\nrelatedness applies in melodic contexts, while octave equivalence is\nassumed in chordal contexts. This conclusion, \nAgmon notes, is\nsupported by existing literature in the field of music perception—for\nexample, Deutsch and Boulanger conclude that “[ . . . ] octave equivalence\neffects should not operate directly in the processing of melodic\nintervals,” (1) —and in turn supports a \nconceptual distinction between\nRoman-numeral and figured-bass approaches to chordal analysis.",

In particular, Clough and Engebretsen focus on eight\nproperties of scales— generated (Wooldridge notation), well-formed (Carey and Clampitt), Myhill-property (Clough and \nMyerson), maximally\neven (Clough and Douthett), diatonic (Agmon; Clough and \nDouthett), deep (Gamer), Balzano , and one previously undefined \nproperty, distributionally even , under which a generic interval comes in\neither one of two sizes.  They identify a network of implicative\nrelationships among these features, and then present a taxonomy, based\non twelve different combinations of these features, governing all\npitch-class sets corresponding to interval cycles or cycle\ncombinations.  Algorithmic approaches to the generation of all pc sets\nwith specific combination of features were also discussed.",

                "text": "[6] In “Recent Diatonic Theory and Curwen’s Tonic Sol-Fa Method:\nFormal Models for a Kinesic-Harmonic System,” Jay Rahn explores\ndifferent aspects of English educator and priest John Curwen’s\n(1816–1880) ear-training pedagogy.  Curwen was the inventor of Tonic\nSol-Fa Method including the hand-sign system that is still in use\ntoday within the Kodaly tradition, for instance.  Rahn discusses the\nlogic underlying Curwen’s system, describing, for example, how the\ndistribution of vowel sounds among the seven syllables and the visual\nand motor-kinesic aspects of the hand movements correspond to voice\nleading and tendency-tone properties of the diatonic scale.  Rahn\nsuggests that, in this respect, Curwen’s hand signs “illuminate one of\nthe most difficult distinctions in music theory, between scale\nand tonality,” in that they model distinctions between and the\ninteraction of consonances and dissonances. Rahn \nalso notes an\nisomorphism between Curwen’s hand signs and Benjamin Boretz’s\nformulation of voice-leading structures and triadic tonality, and sets\nout to extend Boretz’s work. (2) More \nspecifically, Rahn discusses\nCurwen’s privileging of the tonic, dominant, and subdominant triads on\nthe basis of the following relationship:  the tonic triad plus its\ntranspositions upward and downward by five semitones/three scale\ndegrees yields the complete scale.  Rahn formalizes this property,\nfocusing in particular on the cardinality of the “tonic” chord\nversus that of the scale, on the distribution of intervals of two and\nthree scale degrees within the “tonic” chord, and of course on the\ndegree of transposition required to generate the entire scale.\nPatterns of resolution, then, are arranged symmetrically about a tonic\nhalf octave.  This formalization leads to the fascinating insight that\n“Curwen’s structures implode and explode fractally”—a notion Rahn\nillustrates with the example of a nineteen-note scale, generated from\na seven-note tonic chord which itself displays a Curwen resolution\npattern.",

In his\nfinal paragraph, however, he takes an ideological turn, which is as \nunexpected as it is stimulating: “Whereas delicate non-pitch (i.e., \ntimbral, micro-rhythmic/loudness) factors are all one can cite in \ndefense of Curwen’s apparently Euro-centric privileging of major \n(as well as root position, dominant skewing, and raised leading-tones), \none must acknowledge that Curwen’s formulation itself has been for more \nthan a century a worldwide factor in shaping production, perception,\ncognition, and conceptualization at all levels of formal training.\nArguably, the closed, ‘totalizing,’ hierarchical structure of Curwen\ntonality has been a powerful agent of European aesthetic hegemony,\nenabling quick ‘overlearning’ of authoritative, tonal structures,\nwhile erecting barriers to subsequent influence in ‘other’\npossibilities.”",

The entire composition contains only two\neight-bar periods, each of which is repeated.  The first section\nbegins in B minor and ends on D major, and the second section ends in\nB minor.  Edlund altered the piece in two ways so that it ends in D \nmajor.  In the first version, D major is prolonged from the double \nbar through the end of the piece; in the second version, the first \nsection ends in B minor, and D major is not established until toward \nthe end of the piece.  Given the direction “something is odd with the \nharmonic/tonal development of the music—find out what it is!,” more \nthan half of the eighty-eight subjects were unable to identify the \nproblem—even after three to five playings in some cases.  Listeners, \nEdlund concludes, do not demand tonal closure even within the context \nof a short, harmonically straightforward piece.",

Is the metaphysical foundation \nfor it really strong enough to support the element of top-down processing \nin tonal analysis?  And what else is left to recommend it when the \ncollected analytic evidence from successfully reduced masterpieces can be\nquestioned?”",

Following\nhis presentation, for example, the question was raised as to whether\nhis subjects might not have heard the first variant as a D-major piece\nbeginning on the submediant—a point Edlund himself had conceded in\nhis paper. However, since similar results have \nbeen reported by\nothers—Edlund cites Nicholas Cook (3) and Vladimir Konecni and Mitchell\nKarno (4) —Edlund’s criticisms might \nbetter be addressed on a different\nlevel.  Even if a majority of listeners do not attend to tonal closure,\nwould this suggest that the Schenkerian approach is somehow flawed?\nAfter all, tonal closure is undeniably a characteristic trait of the\nworks to which Schenker intended his analytic approach to\napply—whether or not the majority of listeners recognize its\npresence.",

Indeed, it is doubtful that musicians such as Murray\nPerahia would show interest in Schenkerian analysis if this approach\ndid not yield perceptually relevant musical insights.  Certainly\ndifferent insights might be gained, as Edlund argues, “from other,\nless ‘tonal’ reductions, from descriptions that are suppressed by\nanalytical orthodoxy,” but his findings are by no means as\n“devastating” as he suggests and absolutely do not support the\noutright abandonment of one of the most powerful analytic approaches\nwe have for tonal music.",
