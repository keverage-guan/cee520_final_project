    "abstract": "In recent decades, we have seen a surge in published work on embodied music cognition, and it is now broadly accepted that musical experience is intimately linked with experiences of body motion. It is also clear that music performance is not something abstract and without restrictions, but something traditionally (i.e., before the advent of electronic music) constrained by our possibilities for body motion. The focus of this paper is on these various constraints of sound-producing body motion that shape the emergent perceptual features of musical sound, as well as on how these constraints may enhance our understanding of agency in music perception.",

Therefore, there has traditionally been an imprint of human effort and of human artifacts, in short, of human agency, on music as we know it. It may be argued that this imprint has persisted even after the advent of various means for electronic sound production, by a projection of traditional mental schemas of body motion onto musical sound that draws its energy from an electric power supply.",

As such, it is a fundamental constraint on music making and affects performers’ interaction with musical instruments, including the human voice. From such interactions, we see the emergence of so-called idioms in music making, ‘idioms’ here defined as sets of sounds and/or sound passages that are easy to produce and well-sounding. There are a number of possible sound-producing actions in music performance, as well as a number of difficult or conceivably impossible ones.  The distinction derives from what can be denoted motor constraints in music.  This paper will explore these constraints and reflect on how they are embedded in our sensations of agency in musical experience.",

The main point of this perspective is to understand all musical experience as somehow related to sensations of sound-producing body motion. But this perspective will also necessitate discussions of timescales , as there are distinct qualitative features of both sound and motion at the different timescales involved in musical experience. Furthermore, there are a number of instrument constraints and body motion constraints that together limit possibilities of musical expression, and we need to assess how these constraints help shape musical expression —in particular, shape the possibilities for what could be called musical translations , the transfer of musical ideas from one set of motor constraints to another, as is done in orchestrating a piano score. Towards the end of the paper, this will lead to some ontological reflections , reflections on ‘what-is-what’ in musical experience, such as the relationships between notation, sound, and body motion in our concepts of music. The main contention will then be that the perception and/or imagery of human body motion is a salient reflection of human agency in music. 2. Motor theory perspectives",

In parallel, an understanding of body motion has emerged as an essential element of human perception and cognition in general ( Gallese and Metzinger 2003 ), such as in social cognition ( Wilson and Knöblich 2005 ), and even in more abstract thought ( Gallese and Lakoff 2005 ). In our present context, we should note that the crucial role of body motion in human perception and cognition has permeated some of the leading research on human agency, with the contention that we perceive the world, including the behavior and utterances of fellow humans, by way of mental simulation of the body motion related to whatever it is that we are perceiving. Also, it has been argued that agency, in the sense of mental simulation of motion, is indeed embedded in our basic neurocognitive faculties (see Gallese 2000 for details).",

This may be seen as valid for different modalities, such as in vision, with the principle of active tracing of whatever it is that we are seeing ( Berthoz 1997 ), and in audition with the so-called motor theory of auditory perception ( Liberman and Mattingly 1985 ). Originating in linguistics, the motor theory (or rather motor theories , as there are variants here) has since been extended to other domains ( Galantucci, Fowler, and Turvey 2006 ). It was initially met with a great deal of skepticism; however brain observation studies in recent decades have lent much support to this theory (e.g., Haueisen and Knösche 2001 , Kohler et al. 2002 , Bangert and Altenmüler 2003 ).",

In the case of language, this means mentally simulating the vocal apparatus motion of some language—its so-called phonological gestures . In the case of music, it means mentally simulating instrumental or vocal sound-producing motion. One crucial, and sometimes not so well understood, feature of motor theory, is that of approximate renderings, or approximate imitation. For instance, there are many languages that I can neither speak nor understand (e.g., Arabic and Chinese), yet I believe that I am able to distinguish between these two by way of rather vague and inexact mental renderings of the two languages’ different sets of phonological gestures. Likewise, phenomena such as scat singing and beatboxing in music attest to the possibility of approximate imitations of non-vocal sounds by the human vocal apparatus, imitations sufficiently similar to the original sounds so as to enable recognition.",

Modulatory motion that modifies the sound (e.g., the left hand changing pitch on a string instrument, or the opening and closing of a mute on a brass instrument) Ancillary motion, a collective term for motion used by musicians to help in the expressive shaping of the music, and also to avoid fatigue and strain injury, hence motion not strictly excitatory nor modulatory, yet it seems, indispensable for most musicians.

In order to find out more about this, we carried out some studies on air instrument performance ( Godøy, Haga, and Jensenius 2006 ), exploring the imitative capabilities of different listeners, ranging from experts to people with little or no musical training. The results suggest that people have a high degree of knowledge of sound-producing body motion in music, despite the variations in accuracy and detail related to levels of musical training.",

Music induces images of motion that reflect salient features of musical sound, such as pitch contours, dynamics, various rhythmical patterns, and motion and effort, all of which may vary in motion trajectory (i.e., people may move differently to the same musical sound). Such variations in sound-accompanying body motion can be ascribed to listeners focusing on different aspects of the musical sound texture (foreground melody, accompaniment patterns, percussion patterns, etc.) and can be understood as interpretations of the music’s multiple gestural affordances ( Godøy 2010 ).",

In some music, the pulse may be very salient, and in other cases not ( Lartillot et al. 2008 ), suggesting that listeners have an ability to extract pulse information from rather complex sound textures—an ability related to what could be called auditory gist perception ( Harding, Cooke, and König 2007 ), an under-researched topic. In summary, music may evoke a wide range of motion sensations in listening, ranging from details of sound-producing motion to more global sensations of energy and pulse. In most cases, these sensations are quite closely linked to one or more salient features of the sound. 3. Timescales of music-related sound and body motion",

                "text": "[3.1] To better understand how sensations of body motion are evoked by musical sound, we will briefly look at the different timescales possible here. To begin, we have quasi-stationary features in the range of audible vibrations extending from approximately 20 to 20,000Hz, including perceptually salient features such as pitch and the stationary components of timbre and loudness. Next, below the 20Hz region, we find some other very salient features of music: in the fastest range of this region are various transients and fluctuations in pitch, timbre, and dynamics of the sound, including tremolos and trills; in a slower range of this region are the dynamic, timbral, and pitch-related envelopes of individual tones or sound events; and in a still slower range of this region are constellations of tones or sounds in succession to form various rhythmical, textural, melodic, and timbral patterns. In our work on music-related body motion, we have made a tentative distinction between three main timescales that we believe also are relevant for our considerations here of motor constraints in musical experience: Micro timescale , which encompasses continuous motion (such as in continuous bowing on a string instrument) or stationary postures (such as in sustained tones on a wind instruments or by the human voice), resulting in continuous sound. This timescale also includes very rapid repeated motion such as vibrato, trills, or tremolos, resulting in micro-textural features that appear to be continuous or quasi-stationary. Listeners are very quick to recognize such features of timbre and micro-textures (often referred to as “sound” in popular music research), sometimes in fragments as short as 250 milliseconds ( Gjerdingen and Perrott 2008 ). Meso timescale , approximately in the 0.5 to 5 seconds duration range, typically encompass singular sonic events or chunks of fused sonic events, such as rhythmical, textural, and melodic patterns. Meso timescale chunks are holistically perceived and conceived as units, and include stylistic, expressive, and affective elements readily perceived by listeners ( Godøy 2013 ). Macro timescale , which includes several meso timescale chunks in succession, and may typically encompass sections and even whole works of music. At this timescale, we can speak of more global sensations of motion, such as calm, agitated, jerky , or smooth , and their corresponding kinematic and effort-related features, features that are detectable with motion capture and video processing methods.",

Impulsive , denoting a short burst of sound resulting from a discontinuous peak of effort, such as hitting or plucking.

Additionally, there are also two main classes of fluctuations in the quasi-stationary mass, related to body motion in performance: Grain , denoting the fast fluctuations within the sound—sometimes the ‘natural’ outcome of the sound-producing motion (e.g., the ‘brrrrrr’ sound of a deep double bass sound or the stroking of a maraca), and sometimes the performer’s back-and-forth or rotational body motion in tremolos or trills.

The abovementioned idioms are situated at the intersection of the physical makeup of an instrument and performance motion. Historically, there has been an interactive process of instrument, ergonomics, and sound design, leading to the emergence of repertoires of highly successful idioms and to the exploitation of these idioms for maximal sound effect, at minimal effort cost or difficulty for the performer. The orchestrations of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in his mature period are prime examples of this optimal adaptation of instrument constraints to body motion constraints. Example 1 .

Also, with the possibility of producing any sound in theory, whether previously heard or unheard, the difficulty comes in precisely controlling the desired sound features in sound synthesis. One solution is to simulate the sound generation of real physical instruments by various, and often simplified, models, where it should be possible to predict features of the output in response to the input of the model. For example, increased force in the excitation of a so-called physical model piano string should also produce changes in the timbre of the output sound, and not only an increase in the amplitude of the sound. The desire to control expressivity has spurred an extensive effort in re-introducing the human touch in digital music by developing so-called new interfaces for musical expression (NIME).",

There are also limits on maximal force, and there is the need for rests and change of posture to avoid fatigue or strain injury. Added to such basic biomechanical constraints are also those of motor control, with constraints of reaction speed, manifest in the so-called psychological refractory period ( Klapp and Jagacinski 2011 ). This in turn entails the need for anticipation, i.e. of moving an effector in place before the sound onset motion can take place, the need for grouping motion into chunks and into action hierarchies, and the need for automatization in order to be fast enough. In short, there are several constraints on sound-producing motion that are well known in musical performance, and in our context, we also have the following constraints that strongly contribute to shaping musical performance: The most obvious is the earlier mentioned phase-transition , which is dependent on speed and density of events and results in groupings of body motion. Related to phase-transition is the phenomenon of coarticulation , meaning the fusion of otherwise separate motion units and sounds into coherent chunks that are perceived (and conceived) holistically. Coarticulation is studied extensively in linguistics and, to a certain extent in robotics and other movement-related sciences, but less so in music. The main elements of coarticulation in music is that the motion of the effectors are embedded in contexts of past and future motion, effectively resulting in a contextual smearing of both the body motion and the resultant sound.",

For this reason, we may speak of carry over effects (i.e., the context of recently past events) and anticipatory effects (i.e., the context of coming events), in coarticulation. Spatial coarticulation : an effector may, depending on required force and on context, variably recruit neighboring effectors (e.g., the finger may recruit hand, arm, elbow, shoulder and even torso motion in hitting a key).",

If we accept that coarticulation is an integral part of human motion in musical performance, with consequences for the shaping of the resultant musical sound, the next step will be to recognize that performance is not just a matter of ‘interpretation,’ but more precisely that performance is a transformation of the score to a series of coarticulated human motion chunks and sonic objects . This recognition should also spur us to make some critical reflections on the status of musical works as such, starting with the question: Can a musical work survive a transfer from one instrumental or vocal setting to another, and somehow retain its identity across a re-orchestration or, what could be called, a ‘musical translation’? 7.

To what extent is the overall sense of body motion of the original preserved in such a piano reduction?

However, what has been missing is a versatile scheme for representing salient features of unfolding musical sound and music-related body motion. Fortunately, we see the emergence of methods for signal-based sound analysis that enable us to represent more perceptually salient features of musical sound, such as timbre, texture, dynamics, and also various expressive nuances. These methods help close the gaps between the symbolic representations of Western music notation and the continuous, sub-symbolic features of musical sound (see Castellengo 2015 for an excellent overview of signal-based representations). Likewise, we now have methods and technologies for capturing and studying music-related body motion, and we are also able to explore in detail the correlations between features of sound and body motion in musical experience ( Godøy and Leman 2010 ).",

                "text": "[8.5] Such studies of correlations between sound and body motion in music serve to demonstrate that music is multimodal, involving the main modalities of sound and motion, with motion in turn generally considered as a composite that comprises not only kinematics and effort, but also touch, proprioception, balance, and possibly other components as well. Needless to say, there remain substantial challenges for the study of musical experiences based on continuous sound and continuous body motion, yet it is a worthwhile and necessary undertaking, in view of the crucial ontological status of continuous sound and body motion in music from our motor theory perspective.",

Thinking of musical features as shapes should help us to think of music as continuous unfolding motion, rather than as discrete symbols, and encourage us to think of musical performance as a fusion of individual motion and sound events that form coarticulated motion-sound chunks, thus enhancing our capacity for recognizing and exploring human agency in musical experience. 9.

A consequence of this view will be the recognition of the imprint of human agency everywhere in music. And with the use of available methods and technologies, we can in historically unprecedented ways zoom in on and represent through graphs, animations, and pictures what we believe are typical reflections of human body motion in music.",

However, this domain should not only include the affective features of musical performance, but also the typical human body-motion features of musical performances (as opposed to machine-based performances), on the meso timescale of tones, rhythms, grooves, and phrases, as well as on the micro timescale of within-tone and between-tone expressive nuances. This means that we need to recognize human motor constraints on sound-producing motion as integral to musical sound.",
