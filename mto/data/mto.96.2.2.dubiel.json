The exception that I’m eager to acknowledge is Rose\nRosengard Subotnik’s complex treatment of contemporary music,\nundertaken in the context of a wide-ranging exploration of different\nkinds of listening. (1) My engagement with her work has changed the\nfocus of this presentation, to the issue of what she calls “structural\nlistening,” which I see as a central issue for anyone concerned with\nmusic theory.  That’s what I’m going to talk about.  Broadly, I’m\ngoing to say that I don’t know how I feel about it; but it may take a\nwhile for this to become clear.",

In various \nplaces in her essays, structure stands opposed to all \nthese things: “medium,” “sound,” “style,” the “sensuous,” \nand “the sensuous manifestation of values.”  The last is \nfrom a provocative sentence in Subotnik’s paper “The \nChallenge of Contemporary Music” [ Developing \nVariations , 265–93] that I’d like to use to invoke all \nof these oppositions together.  Subotnik is talking about \npopular music here, but unless I misread her utterly, she \nwould claim that the situation she refers to is only an \nespecially stark version of one that is in fact quite \ngeneral.  “What the public hears in such music,” she \nwrites, “is what is always heard, not autonomous \nstructure but the sensuous manifestation of particular \ncultural values” [“Contemporary Music,” 288].",

Without particularly paying attention,\nhere’s what I could hear: a point being made of a thin sound in the\nleading lines, an almost simpering voice and an old-fashioned sounding\nsynthesizer, exposing a more elaborately produced rhythm section in a\nway that suggested some flavor of dance music, even though the beat\nitself was not particularly intense; and then, against this, the\nentrance of a chorus whose utterances, while very quiet and brief,\nsounded remarkably full, heavy, and committed, in a way that\nimmediately said “gospel.”  For me this choral entrance was a nice\nmoment: one that changed my hearing of the context in which it was\nembedded, bringing out an attribute of what preceded it that I hadn’t\nparticularly noticed—because really it was the change of tone that\nmade me hear the initial tone of the thing the way I’ve described, as\nmaking a point of having a thin sound, not just happening to have one.",

I can’t tell you whether I was hearing a secular love song\nmaking a gospel reference or a religious song making use of pop styles\nor something more ambiguous.  But I don’t need to.  What I mean to do\nis report an actual incident of musical perception, with its\naccidents, including its omissions; and to acknowledge how I found\nstyles and their associations coming into play, in a flash, without\nmuch attention, and even though I have no particularly deep knowledge\nof, or intense interest in, the styles in question.",

I\nconsider it perfectly possible that acoustically the identical sounds,\nwithout these associations, might not have struck me as interestingly\ncombined, maybe not even as competently combined.  Certainly the move\nfrom one to the other would have had a different dynamic if all I’d\nbeen able to make of it was the entry of more voices.  It’s\ninteresting that I didn’t have to believe the styles’ social\nimplications to get the point; that is, without actually regarding\ndancing as corrupt or religion as redemptive, I could still pick up a\nmusical dynamic that made use of those notions—that ran them together\nwith sonic characteristics in a move from thinner to fuller, with the\nlatter prompting reconsideration of the former.  Thus, even at the\nlevel of compositional technique—of my so-called craft\nknowledge—what I noticed was shot through with these cultural\nassociations.

Certainly my hearing of the song was\naffected by cultural associations of the styles in question.  In that\nsense, it must have been an instance of the kind of non- structural\nlistening that Subotnik challenges us to consider.  But is it so clear\nthat the features of the song that I’ve described should be considered\nnot to be structural too?  I’ve quoted a definition of structure as\n“relationships established over the course of a single composition.”\nClearly my hearing of the contrasting sounds of the song’s verse and\nchorus drew on knowledge from outside the piece.  But what about the\nrelationship I heard between them?  Was the contrast between these\nsounds something that existed for me before I heard this piece?  Not\nthat I know.  And what about the dynamic of moving from the one to the\nother?  The change in tone, the enlargement of the sound—with an\nenlargement in the sound’s sensed potential significantly exceeding\nthe actual increase—all this happening in such a way that the second\nsound prompted a reconsideration of the first?  Is it plausible that\nthese relationships were established other than over the course of\nthis single composition?  When else?  In short: why shouldn’t I be\nable to say that a suggestion of gospel in the chorus is a feature of\nthis work’s structure—even though some aspect of its definition is\nextrinsic to this work?  And even: how could I not say that it’s a\nfeature of the work’s structure, given that its identity, its meaning\nfor me as sound, is affected by the relationships in which it\nparticipates?",

(2) That’s an exaggeration, of course, as I’m sure\nBoretz would agree; in my life, it happens to have been a more\nstimulating exaggeration than ones like Subotnik’s.  What it has\nstimulated, above all, is a mistrust of the idea that attributing\nstructure to a work means showing the work to manifest a\nself-contained logic of a predetermined kind; an inclination, instead,\nto try to think of anything that I hear in a work as open to audible\ninteraction with anything else, in relationships that can affect its\nperceived identity, its meaning for me as sound.",

Musical meaning does not end with the attribution\nof identity to sounds, but with this it has already begun.  And it is\nto the meaningfulness of sound that I need my interpretive practices\nto be attuned: I want to be able to move easily among the various\nkinds of characteristics that I attribute to sound, regardless of the\nsupposed internality or externality, the supposed rigor or\ncontingency, of the factors that elicit these attributions.",

It puzzles me\nto see these offered as paraphrases of each other—to see the imagined\nend state of a distinction’s being undercut so nearly identified with\nthat of its terms being retained in a new ranking.  Admittedly Jacques\nDerrida envisions deconstruction as involving both “a reversal of\nthe classical opposition and a general displacement of the\nsystem,” the former indeed as a necessary condition for “ intervening in the field of oppositions it criticizes”; he denies that it can\n“pass directly to a neutralization.” (4) But Subotnik seems less\nfastidious; in particular her proposal to present structual listening\n“in Derrida’s sense as a ‘supplement’ to” non-structural listening\n[“Deconstruction,” 88] so departs from the usual sense of these\npractices (the move she describes would be expected to be made,\nparadoxically, in a deconstruction of non -structural listening) that\nit comes across as expressing only a rough interest in which of the\npreexistent options comes out on top.  As a theorist, I would like to\nsee the notion of structure that bothers Subotnik and me well and\ntruly dismantled—not kept around as a whipping-boy.  So I feel more\nsolidarity with her project of undercutting than with her project of\nrehierarchization. (5)",

My wish is to affirm, by whatever conceptual means, our\ninvolvement as perceivers in the creation of our ontologies of sound,\nthrough the relations by which we imagine them to be configured.  I\nsee no obstacle in principle to our admitting to these ontologies\nentities and relationships that Subotnik places outside the realm of\nstructure— certainly no obstacles worth respecting that are set up\nby the uncritically accepted connotations of the word “structure,” by\nwhich connotations I am at least as unimpressed as she is.  The\nproject to which I want to adjust my concepts is that of expanding as\nfar as possible our awareness of what the realm of the audible can\ninclude, in the excited expectation that this realm ends only by\nopening out into further kinds of meaning, not by hitting a wall.\nThis is an attitude that I would consider constructive.",
