    "abstract": "As a field, we must work to recognize and elevate music theorists traditionally excluded from our histories of music theory. In this article, I introduce and examine one such excluded figure, Sarah Mary Fitton (ca. 1792–1874). Fitton’sConversations on Harmony(1855), a series of dialogues between the fictitious young Edward and his mother, was popular with students and amateur musicians in Great Britain and France during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Study of her work (Shteir 1996; Rainbow 2009; Maust 2022) has centered almost exclusively on its pedagogical merit and not its music-theoretical content. I take Fitton’sConversationsbeyond its usual music-educational context: while affirming all of her work as music theory, I highlight Fitton’s distinctive approach to augmented sixth chords, which encompasses generation, resolution, enharmonic reinterpretation, modulation, and chromatic-scale harmonization. Her work represents an important contribution to our historical understanding of chromatic harmony.I also consider several crucial questions about Fitton and herConversations. How might Fitton’s gendered dialogue both reinforce and subvert contemporaneous stereotypes about gender and professionalism? Why has her pedagogically orientedConversationsbeen largely ignored by the field of music theory? Why do Fitton and other women—such as Anne Young (Raz 2018a, 2018b), Oliveria Prescott (Lumsden 2020, 2022), Nanine Chevé, Louisa Kirkman, Fannie Hughey, Clare Osborne Reed, and Amy Dommel-Diény—traditionally not count as music theorists? How can the study of these authors and those from other marginalized communities help us reframe our music-theoretical questions? How can such studies help us understand and reform our methods of discipline formation?",

Sophie Fuller ( 2018 , 151) discusses notions of “amateur” and “professional” in nineteenth-century Great Britain: during the first half of the century, the professional musician was associated with “the lower social classes, often [stereotyped as] a European immigrant with a poor general education.” In contrast, the amateur musician “was regarded as widely cultured and firmly situated in the middle or upper classes of British society” ( Fuller 2018 , 151). Julianne Grasso and Cory Arnold ( 2022 ) highlight a twenty-first-century version of the “amateur”/“professional” binary: music theory YouTubers (“amateurs”) versus music theory academics (“professionals”). Grasso and Arnold conclude that an “overall freedom of knowledge-sharing distinguishes MTYT [Music Theory YouTube] from academic music theory,” and “this relative freedom . . . can shed light on a number of issues that circulate in the larger music theory community, helping us to critically evaluate what music theory is, and who gets to do music theory.”",

The 248-page Conversations , discussed in more detail in [1.6] and [1.7], comprises thirty-six dialogues; the 164-page Manuel pratique includes twenty chapters. Fitton notes this size difference in her dedication to Fromental Halévy, remarking that—with his assistance—she has made the French manual as concise as possible. Out of twenty total chapters in the Manuel , twelve combine at least two English conversations; and the eleventh, twelfth, fifteenth, and sixteenth chapters each comprise three English conversations. Fitton also includes new material: an eleven-page summary (inserted after the fourteenth chapter) and a section on transposition with clefs (part of the eighteenth chapter). The latter addition aligns Fitton’s book with the pedagogical tradition of her new French audience. While both manuals are written in dialogue format, they feature different conversational modes: Edward plays a primary role in the English version; Mother is the main character in the French version. The books feature similar music-theoretical topics. However, in the French version, Fitton simplifies her discussions of augmented sixth chords and the rule of the octave, arguably her most novel material. I suggest that the changes from the English Conversations to the French Manuel reflect prevailing French attitudes regarding female education and gender ideals. Fitton’s revisions in the Manuel are neither minimal nor trivial: they represent a thorough and calculated reworking for a new French—and thoroughly female—audience. The French book does not present the science of harmony to a wide audience of children and amateurs. Rather, it offers practical skills for the supposedly delicate female mind.",

The second notice ( “Nouvelles” 1857b , 197), appearing three months after the French book’s publication, announces that the manual has nearly sold out.

Example 2 in the thirty-second conversation ( 1855 , 199) includes a similar resolution, with an Aug3 chord followed by a cadential six-four. While unsurprising to twenty-first-century readers, these resolutions are unusual for Fitton, representing an apparent disconnect between her theoretical rule, where augmented sixth chords resolve to root-position triads, and compositional practice, where the voice-leading context often necessitates resolution to inverted triads. Fitton’s resolutions also prompt questions about the harmonic function of augmented sixth chords. As Kyle Hutchinson ( 2020a , 94) notes, this is “a complicated topic.” While many contemporary scholars label augmented sixth chords as predominants or subdominants, some—such as Joel Lester ( 1982 ) and Hutchinson ( 2020a )—explain augmented sixth chords as dominant-functioning sonorities. Fitton does not have a theory of harmonic function. If considered under modern categories, her augmented sixth chords would be functionally fluid: depending on the musical context, they would function as predominants or dominants.",

She covers “Modulation into a Distant Scale” in Conversations 29–31. Conversation 29 includes four methods of modulation: modulation from a major scale into the relatives of the same scale (minor) and from a minor scale into the relatives of the same scale (major), demonstrated by Examples 1–4 ( Fitton 1855 , 176); modulation via the “double resolution of the dominant,” shown in Examples 1–5 ( Fitton 1855 , 177); modulation via a half-step bass ascent from a dominant chord to a root-position tonic chord in a new scale, depicted in Examples 1–6 ( Fitton 1855 , 177–78); and the placement of “the chord of the tonic of one scale immediately after that of another scale, to which it has no affinity,” illustrated in Examples 1–8 ( Fitton 1855 , 179). Conversation 30 focuses on enharmonic modulation via the chord of the diminished seventh. Conversation 31 covers enharmonic modulation via the tonic chord, the dominant seventh chord, and the augmented sixth chord; in addition, Fitton discusses “Half Modulation,” which she designates with a + sign and defines as when “we meet with one or more chords that do not belong to the scale in which that music is written,” as shown in Examples 1–4 ( 1855 , 191).",

This practice aligns with Mother’s earlier statement that “no modulation is complete, unless we make a perfect cadence of the scale into which we wish to enter” ( Fitton 1855 , 160). As discussed in endnote 35, the eleventh progression departs from the others: a cadential six-four—not a root-position triad—follows the augmented sixth chord ( Fitton 1855 , 191).",

To my knowledge, Vogler’s treatises were never translated into English during Fitton’s lifetime, and there is no evidence that Fitton read German. Fitton and Vogler also share an alteration-focused method of augmented sixth chord generation; Floyd Grave and Margaret Grave ( 1987 , 24, 36) discuss Vogler’s procedure. Fitton’s approach to chord generation also partially aligns with that of A. B. Marx in the first volume of Die Lehre von der musikalischen Komposition, praktisch-theoretisch ( 1837–47 ) and Die alte Musiklehre im Streit mit unserer Zeit ( 1841 ). These works were first translated into English in 1852 and 1997 (selected excerpts), respectively. David Damschroder ( 2008 , 185–90) provides a helpful summary of Marx’s methods. According to Marx, all augmented sixth chords “arise from a chromatic alteration of one of the dominant chords, or chords of the diminished seventh” ( 1852 , 261); Fitton’s approach is more liberal, as she allows for an Aug2 chord to derive from an altered minor triad. The first volume of Gottfried Weber’s Versuch einer geordneten Theorie der Tonsetzkunst ( 1817–21 ), translated into English in 1842, also offers chord generation via alteration; however, Weber ( 1842 , 214) considers augmented sixth chords to be altered o II 7 chords.",

While associating his two augmented sixth chords (Italian and German) with the “extreme sharp sixth,” Shield identifies these sonorities as standalone “chords of the Seventh, which cannot be formed with the notes of the Diatonic scale”; furthermore, he continues, “some Denominators have termed them [the two augmented sixth chords] Anomalous and others Spurious” ( 1815 , 14). Shield’s Italian augmented sixth chord is equivalent to Fitton’s Aug1 chord. In her analysis of the first movement of Beethoven’s Sonata in E ♭ , Op. 7, Prescott ( 1888 , 411) identifies an augmented sixth chord in the secondary theme, noting that it is “built upon the dominant and super-tonic roots in the key of B flat.” She does not provide additional commentary. In her last book, Prescott ( 1904 , 89) presents German, French, and Italian sixths in C major. She does not explain these sonorities; she merely comments on how they reflect “the three schools of the Continent.” According to Rachel Lumsden ( 2022 ), Prescott usually discusses chromatic harmonies “with a pithy, matter-of-fact tone, without laborious explanation.” Fitton, in contrast, provides thorough music-theoretical explanations.

Chevé published several treatises, including Nouvelle théorie des accords (servant de base à l’étude de l’harmonie ) ( 1844b ), Méthode élémentaire de musique vocale ( 1844a ), and Méthode élémentaire d’harmonie ( 1856 ), co-authored with her husband. Little is known about the English music theorist Louisa Kirkman. Kirkman published several music-theoretical works under the name “Mrs. Joseph Kirkman,” notably the undated Improved Method for the Guitar ( n.d. ) and A Practical Analysis of the Elementary Principles of Harmony ( 1845 ). American music theorist Fannie Hughey (1857–1929) ran the Hughey Color-Music Model School for young children and provided training classes for mothers and teachers at the Millikin Conservatory of Music in Decatur, Illinois; she disseminated her method, which reflects the widespread vogue for color-music at the beginning of the twentieth century, through Color Music for Children ( 1912 ). Clare Osborne Reed (1864–1954)—an American music theorist, concert pianist, and founder of the Columbia School of Music—published Constructive Harmony and Improvisation ( 1927 ), which teaches diatonic and chromatic harmony through improvisational practice. French music theorist and composer Amy Dommel-Diény (1894–1981) taught harmony and counterpoint at the Schola Cantorum in Paris and at the Strasbourg Conservatory; according to Serge Gut ( 1976 , 10), she was “the only renowned representative of functional theory in France.” Her main theoretical work, L’harmonie vivante ( 1953 ), went through three editions and eventually expanded into a six-book series.",

While agreeing with Christensen, I argue that we have even more to reframe: when writing our histories of music theory (whether centered on the partimento tradition or early nineteenth-century chromatic harmony), we must actively seek out and elevate “hidden” music-theoretical contributions, particularly those by women and members of other underrepresented groups.

The Manuel pratique is much more than a translation; it is a complete reworking for an audience of female boarding school students and mothers. (5) Attributed to the gender-neutral “S. M. Fitton,” the book bears a mark of approval from the Paris Conservatory and a dedication to Fromental Halévy, a respected composer and member of the Institut de France. Again, Fitton’s work met with success: according to the Revue et gazette musicale , the first edition nearly sold out within three months of publication. (6) Several reviews from the time confirm a positive reception. Adrien de La Fage ( 1857 , 131) lauds Mr. [ sic ] Fitton’s clear presentation, thoughtful ordering of material, and particularly helpful coverage of the rule of the octave. Hector Berlioz extends even higher praise in a satirical review: he cautions that Mr. [ sic ] Fitton’s “perfectly written” manual will certainly corrupt “the musical morality of young people and the safety of their parents and friends,” inciting innocent female boarders “to compose sentimental romances, passionate airs, love scenes, even damnable and damned comic operas.” Be warned, remarks Berlioz—over a thousand copies of the textbook have already been sold ( 1857 , 228).",

The Irish writer, also a co-author of the celebrated Conversations on Botany ( 1817 ), remains virtually unknown in scholarly circles. (7) The few existing studies on Fitton focus almost exclusively on her pedagogical contributions, emphasizing her clear instructional approach and effective use of dialogue form. Ann Shteir’s ( 1996 ) discussion of Conversations on Botany highlights Fitton’s pedagogical style and her male influences. (8) Shteir credits Fitton’s brother William, a gentleman scientist who regularly hosted scientific conversazioni at the family home, with facilitating her botanical literacy. By virtue of her male guidance, Fitton’s work is both “exemplary in substance” and “exemplary in method”: she “educates the mother by giving her content and teaches her so that she can teach her children” ( Shteir 1996 , 91). Likewise, Bernarr Rainbow ( 2009 , 247) describes Conversations on Harmony as a “domestic primer,” “lesson-notes of a student teacher” “framed as to prompt the reader who wished to instruct a child to go about it methodically.” (9) As detailed in Rainbow’s account, Fitton’s music-theoretical training “depend[ed] upon her upbringing as the younger daughter of a village clergyman of good family who had been educated at Eton and Oxford”: her father, who made a “serious study of harmony as a youth,” taught his daughter “all she knew” ( 2009 , 245–47). (10) Following Shteir and Rainbow, Paula Maust ( 2022 ) emphasizes Fitton’s role as an educator. (11) According to Maust, Fitton’s explanations of quadruple meter and parallel perfect intervals in Conversations on Harmony testify to her “effective pedagogical strategies and her skillful prose.” Maust does not discuss Fitton’s music-theoretical contributions.",

Why should other instructional dialogues—such as Johann Joseph Fux’s Gradus ad Parnassum ( 1725 ), Joseph Riepel’s Anfangsgründe zur musicalischen Setzkunst ( 1752–68 ), and Jérôme-Joseph de Momigny’s La seule vraie théorie de la musique ( 1821 )—warrant critical study while Fitton’s Conversations on Harmony does not?

While affirming all sections of Fitton’s Conversations as music theory, I intentionally highlight her music-theoretical inventiveness: her work on augmented sixth chords represents an important contribution to our historical understanding of chromatic harmony.

(19) By the 1860s, Christina de Bellaigue remarks, “the number of English teachers in Paris was so large that it was feared that many would not find work” ( 2007 , 207). Several letters written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning confirm Fitton’s Paris residence; in a letter dated May 29–30, 1852, the poet notes that “Miss Fitton had lived in Paris above twenty years & knew everybody” (quoted in Lewis 2000 , 484).

However, while Conversations on Harmony addresses both children and amateurs, Conversations on Botany is written expressly for children.

Beyond giving “pleasure to the mind,” botanical pursuits were considered “healthy and invigorating,” granting “to the body the inestimable blessing of health” ( 1844 , 83). As Fitton explains in the preface to Conversations on Botany , “[botany] is not a science of parade, it affords occupation and infinite variety, it demands no bodily strength, it can be pursued in retirement; —there is no danger of its inflaming the imagination, because the mind is intent upon realities” ( 1817 , iv–v). (24) Botanical study was considered especially important for mothers, who “would use nature’s lessons to teach their families” about beauty, morality, and religion, among other topics ( Von Glahn 2013 , 14). The outdoors functioned as “an extension of the domestic sphere”; consequently, it was deemed “an acceptable place for women” ( Von Glahn 2013 , 14, 16). (25) As I discuss in the final section of this article, many nineteenth-century women—particularly middle- and upper-class white women—were subject to similar norms of social acceptability when engaging with music.",

This later music manual is not written in dialogue form. Beyond introducing many of the music-theoretical concepts from Conversations on Harmony , its ninety-one short lessons focus on piano-specific topics, notably fingerings and finger exercises.

Augmented sixth chords first surface in the twenty-fifth conversation, which centers on altered chords. Fitton returns to the topic in the thirty-first conversation, where she discusses enharmonic reinterpretation and modulation.

As Rainbow ( 2009 , 245) describes, this “new type of elementary treatise” was popularized through Jane Marcet’s Conversations on Chemistry ( 1805 ). Marcet subsequently wrote several other manuals in the format, including Conversations on Political Economy ( 1816 ), Conversations on Natural Philosophy ( 1819 ), Conversations on the Evidences of Christianity ( 1826 ), and Conversations on Vegetable Physiology ( 1829 ). The success of Marcet’s books “prompted other anonymous writers to adopt both her manner of exposition and, perhaps somewhat less candidly, her use of Conversations as a title” ( Rainbow 2009 , 245). In her preface to Conversations on Botany , Fitton acknowledges Marcet’s influence: “it may be due to the author of the admirable ‘Conversations on Chemistry,’ to state, that the title of the present volume was chosen, because it was the only one that seemed to be adapted to the nature of the subject, which had not been appropriated by previous writers” ( 1817 , v). While Fitton borrows from a popular trope for Conversations on Harmony ’s title, she does not borrow any of its content: as the next section of the article shows, Fitton’s music-theoretical ideas are very much her own. 2.

In brief, Fitton derives augmented sixth chords from ascending and descending alterations of diminished triads, fully diminished seventh chords, dominant seventh chords, and minor triads. She focuses on linear processes rather than traditional scale-degree mapping and functional assignments. For Fitton, augmented sixth chords also trigger modulation and participate in various chromatic-scale harmonizations. As I discuss briefly at the end of this section, Fitton’s ideas alternately align with and depart from those of her British contemporaries, most notably John Holden ( 1770 ), Anne Young ( 1803 ), William Crotch ( 1812 ), Louisa Kirkman ( 1845 ), and Alfred Day ( [1845] 1855 ). To be clear, it is not known whether Fitton engaged with any outside sources while writing Conversations on Harmony ; she only references Cipriani Potter, who evidently provided her with “valuable suggestions” ( 1855 , iii). However, this broader contextualization with contemporaneous music theory is necessary: it positions Fitton as an important voice in the historical conversation on augmented sixth chords.",

Mother quickly reassures Edward: “this fault is overlooked because the harsh effect of the two fifths is, a good deal, softened by the movement of three of the parts which, simultaneously, descend a half tone.” By contrast, a simultaneous descent by whole tone apparently would have made the effect of the parallel perfect fifths “much more disagreeable” ( Fitton 1855 , 191). Example 3 . An Aug3 chord transformed into an Aug1 chord to avoid parallel perfect fifths between the bass and alto voices ( D ♭ 3 to A ♭ 4 and C3 to G4, bracketed on the example) in Fitton (1855, 150) (click to enlarge)",

In Example 4, F4, the chordal seventh of the dominant seventh chord, is enharmonically reinterpreted as E ♯ 4, which becomes the root of an Aug3 chord. Edward immediately objects to Mother’s derivation of an augmented sixth chord via enharmonic reinterpretation, noting her apparent departure from the earlier alteration-focused approach. “I thought you said that the chord of the augmented sixth was either the second inversion of a chord of the dominant seventh, with the fifth altered in descending, or the first inversion of a chord of the seventh degree, with the third altered in descending,” he remarks ( Fitton 1855 , 189). (36) Mother clarifies that the Aug3 chord in Example 4 ultimately derives from a first-inversion fully diminished seventh chord with a lowered chordal third. The enharmonic reinterpretation functions as a surface-level shortcut, masking the actual derivation via alteration. Example 5 .

The first measure includes a root-position E ♯ fully diminished seventh chord. Arrows show the minor third ( E ♯ 3 to G ♯ 4) between the bass and tenor voices. In the second measure, this interval, again marked with arrows, inverts to a sixth. Furthermore, G ♯ falls to G natural: the change from a major sixth to an augmented sixth results in an Aug3 chord. (Note the typo on Example 5: the Aug3 chord is in first inversion, not in third inversion; Fitton provides the correct inversion in the text.) Therefore, the augmented sixth sonority does not arise from the enharmonic reinterpretation of F as E ♯ but from the alteration downwards of G ♯ to G natural, an approach taken in the first method of generation. Linking to her previous discussion of parallel perfect fifths, Fitton transforms the Aug3 chord into an Aug1 chord at the end of the second measure: C ♯ 5 replaces D5, avoiding parallel perfect fifths (G3 to D5, F ♯ 3 to C ♯ 5) between the bass and alto voices. Following the models in Example 2, the Aug1 chord resolves to a root-position major triad positioned a half step below. Example 6 .

In (3.), the soprano voice rises to A ♯ 4 while the other voices hold: consequently, the major sixth bracketed in (2.) becomes an augmented sixth in (3.). This procedure, featuring a raised fundamental, reverses the process in the first two methods, where the bottom note of a major sixth descends a half step to create an augmented sixth. Ever the perceptive student, Edward asks if he can apply the same method to a first-inversion major triad. No, Mother explains—the minor sixth would expand to a major sixth, creating a diminished triad, not an augmented sixth chord.",

Mother begins the discussion of modulation by telling Edward that “any transition from one scale into another scale is called Modulation” ( Fitton 1855 , 152). She presents three varieties: “Modulation into a Relative Scale,” “Modulation into a Distant Scale,” and “Half Modulation.” (39) When discussing the enharmonic reinterpretation in Example 4, Mother remarks that “this transformation of a chord of the dominant seventh into a chord of the augmented sixth, enables us to modulate into very distant scales” ( Fitton 1855 , 189). However, the augmented sixth chord does more than induce movement to distant scales; Mother notes that “we can use it [the augmented sixth chord] to modulate from one scale into all the others ” ( Fitton 1855 , 190; italics added). Furthermore, any type of augmented sixth chord—if placed “immediately after a chord of the tonic”—initiates modulation ( Fitton 1855 , 190). This statement aligns with Mother’s earlier claim that “any chord of which the fundamental is either the dominant or the leading note of a scale, may be used in modulating” ( Fitton 1855 , 164).

Therefore, the harmonization represents “a succession of unfinished modulations” ( Fitton 1855 , 196). New diatonic collections, while constantly suggested by chromatic pitch classes, are always deferred. Precocious Edward notes that Mother’s exercises in chromatic-scale harmonization depart from musical practice, as “we seldom meet with an entire scale, completely accompanied, in music for the pianoforte” ( Fitton 1855 , 199). While acknowledging the artificiality of these studies, Edward recognizes their pedagogical merit. “The music I play will be much more interesting than it used to be,” he admits at the end of the thirty-second conversation, “now that I begin to see how each note helps to form a chord of some kind” ( Fitton 1855 , 199).",

(50) According to Holden, an augmented sixth chord arises when a diatonic chord is modified via “license” to include an “extreme interval”: “if the flat 6th be in the bass, and the ♯ 4th in an upper part, the chord will consist of an extreme sharp sixth . . . This last chord has been called the Italian sixth ; probably because they [the Italians] first introduced it” ( 1770 , 100; italics original). (51) Similarly, Young’s “chord of the superfluous sixth” “is a license in the use of the first inversion of the subdominant chord, in the minor mode, when that is to pass into the perfect chord of the 5th, or dominant” ( 1803 , 218–19). Young does not use the “Italian” label: she merely explains that the chord “consists in sharpening the note which is 4th of the scale, or 8ve to the fundamental, while the bass note, the 6th of the scale, remains unaltered” ( 1803 , 219). (52) Crotch aligns with Holden’s and Young’s methods, explaining that “the Italian, German, and French sixes are extreme sharp, both in the major and minor key; and are inversions of the triad of Fa” ( 1812 , 71). (53) Kirkman only identifies one augmented sixth chord, which is “merely a modification of the chord of 4/3, (second inversion of the dominant seventh)”; “the bass note [is] accidentally depressed a semitone, augmenting the sixth in the chord, from which it derives its name” ( 1845 , 37). While not following Day’s ( [1845] 1855 ) unorthodox generation of augmented sixth chords via the overtone series, Fitton’s consistent resolution of her augmented sixth chords to a root-position triad mirrors his approach, which offers the same resolution.

Nancy Reich comments that the “cult of domesticity” “caused considerable conflict for professional women musicians”: while recognizing their social deviance, they continued to work outside the home, as “earning money was a real necessity” ( 1993 , 132).

John Tosh ( 2005 , 37) identifies a deeper issue, one tied to “the gender coding of the world of work.” While men readily accepted “the reality of women’s labor in the domestic setting as servants or home-workers,” they could not allow women to be paid workers outside of the home. Tosh explains that this refusal to admit women to the workplace did not stem from the fear that “there might be less work (or less well-paid work)” for men. Rather, these men feared that “their masculine identity as the working sex was at stake” ( Tosh 2005 , 37).",

On the one hand, she portrays Mother as an “Angel in the House”: fulfilling her familial role, Mother, presumably an amateur musician, dutifully teaches her son the requisite music-theoretical concepts and analytical skills. This instruction takes place within the confines of the family home, Mother’s designated domain. On the other hand, Fitton characterizes Mother as a highly trained, intellectually gifted, and pedagogically savvy instructor. To recall Pullan ( 1855 , 81), Mother exhibits “excellence in music”; she expertly explains a wide variety of music-theoretical topics without outside aids.",

(63) That Fitton includes Edward as a main character in her harmony manual is even more surprising given the subject at hand: at the time, music making and music teaching were viewed as highly effeminate endeavors, usually associated with women musicians. (64) In particular, “Victorian society rejected piano playing for the gentleman” ( Burgan 1986 , 60). Gillett notes that “piano-playing carried such strong feminine connotations that boys were often discouraged from studying the instrument” ( 2000 , 5); as a result, piano instruction was generally “absent from male education” ( Vorachek 2000 , 26). This is certainly not the case for Edward, as both mother and son frequently reference the piano and piano playing. (65) “You must always play our examples on the pianoforte,” Mother advises, “that you may understand perfectly what we are about” ( Fitton 1855 , 21). Perhaps the study of music theory—a rational and seemingly scientific subject befitting the Victorian male mind—justifies the learning of a characteristically feminine instrument.",

Not surprisingly, misogynistic practices have played a role in Fitton’s omission from our histories of music theory. Her work, published anonymously and praised on the merits of its male endorsers, has never been recognized for its music-theoretical contributions. While perhaps not an unequivocal barrier in her own era, Fitton’s alleged position as a governess has likely not helped her modern reception. According to Bellaigue, governesses—especially those working during the first half of the nineteenth century—have historically been dismissed as “inexperienced and untrained amateurs,” a negative reputation that needs “substantial modification” ( 2007 , 231).",

Fitton has not benefitted from our field’s historically anti-pedagogical mindset, which deems music-educational works too elementary to merit serious study. (66) These pedagogical offerings may not meet contemporary demands for significance, originality, and rigor. They may not employ academic language. They may not propose new technologies or feature virtuosic analyses; instead, they may rehearse common tropes or highlight ostensibly uncomplicated repertoire. Our field’s degradation of music education has not been without consequence. We have shut out many music theorists and their ideas. Female music theorists, because of their frequent association with educational genres, have suffered particularly severe neglect from this bias against pedagogy. Fitton is just one of these victims: other pedagogically oriented writers—such Anne Young, Oliveria Prescott, Nanine Chevé, Louisa Kirkman, Fannie Hughey, Clare Osborne Reed, and Amy Dommel-Diény, to name just a few—have suffered similar fates. (67) The music theories of these women are not only “hidden,” to borrow Thomas Christensen’s ( [2011] 2016 , 69) description, but they themselves are invisible. (68)",

Carmel Raz ( 2018a , 2018b ) discusses Young, whose musical board games and 1803 treatise extend far beyond juvenile music pedagogy. Young’s theoretical approach, comments Raz, “neither entirely reflected the musical practice of the day, nor disclosed its own grounding in earlier traditions of speculative thought” ( 2018b ). Despite her work’s originality, Young denies her own music-theoretical innovations, instead affording credit to two men: her brother Walter and the aforementioned theorist John Holden. The story of late nineteenth-century music theorist Oliveria Prescott, chronicled by Rachel Lumsden ( 2020 , 2022 ), follows a similar path. Prescott’s discussions of fundamental and advanced topics reflect deep music-theoretical thought and strong engagement with the literature, particularly the writings of George Macfarren. Lumsden confesses her own bias against Prescott’s work, which she initially dismissed as “unscholarly,” “straightforward,” and “primarily pedagogical” ( 2020 , [6.1]). “Sometimes music theory can be discovered in the most unexpected settings,” she concludes, “if we take the time to look—and if we dare to read with an open mind” ( [6.2] ).",

Beyond broadening our music-historical and music-theoretical horizons, the study of music theorists such as Young, Prescott, and Fitton should also cause us to examine our own prejudices and historiographical habits. We must begin by admitting that our adherence to and glorification of music-historical and music-theoretical canons have deeply influenced the figures, musics, concepts, and technologies that we study. (69) We must also acknowledge our natural predilection for familiarity and convenience, our propensity to blindly protect the status quo. We return to the same composers and theorists; we recycle well-worn research questions. We continually grasp for neat, comprehensible, and untroubling historical narratives. These reductive, doxographical tendencies have severely limited our histories of theory: we assume that we have already answered all of the important music-historical and music-theoretical questions.

While encouraging us to broaden our music-historical horizons, I also urge us to reflect on how we might initiate a historiographical transformation. How have we created and perpetuated disciplinary boundaries? How might these boundaries be re-negotiated? Can we weave together fresh perspectives, concepts, and contexts with our traditional narratives? Can we embrace a plurality of music-historical accounts, and in so doing open up a greater web of interpretation? Finally, how might these more diverse histories of music theory lead our discipline not only to deeper musical knowledge, but also \tto an increased sense of belonging, accessibility, and potential?",
