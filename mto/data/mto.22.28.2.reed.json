    "abstract": "Within the stratified harmonic behavior known as melodic-harmonic divorce, this paper identifies a gesture repeated idiomatically across rock repertory. Dubbed “sub-circle” motion, this idiom is specifically a form of syntax divorce wherein a melodic layer unfolds in a way consonant with and suggestive of circle-of-fifths root motion (+P4) between two accompanying major chords; however, the harmonic layer’s root instead moves up by a minor third (+m3), creating a stratified dissonance, or divorce. The paper then identifies a standard set of paradigms—specific transpositional instances of the idiom—and catalogues numerous examples of their use in rock music. One paradigm, V-♭VIIadd9, is the subject of special analytic and historical inquiry, due to its proliferation as a deceptive cadence in the late twentieth century. This previously untheorized cadence is the most prominent instance of the sub-circle idiom.",

Guy Capuzzo ( 2004 , 181) has demonstrated the value of neo-Riemannian approaches in popular music analysis. But although he recommends the techniques in progressions that “contain modal mixture and root motion by third,” my examples below—despite containing those features—do not adhere to his further stipulations. The music and ideas I take up here specifically do not “lack structural dominant harmonies, and . . . leading tones that might carry dominant function,” nor do they derive, for instance, from the “interior of a sequence.” Furthermore, the phenomenon I describe is not strictly concerned with parsimonious voice leading. Finally, it necessarily involves non-triadic simultaneities, and as Frank Lehman ( 2014 , 29) indicates, where music takes up a “richer vocabulary of sonorities than simple major and minor chords . . . NROs [neo-Riemannian operators] offer less help.” As such, I will be using Roman numerals in this article. For more discussion of the analytic notational challenges that MHD presents, see Christopher Doll ( 2013 ), Trevor de Clercq ( 2019 ), and section 4 of this paper. Other useful neo-Riemannian approaches to chromatic mediant progressions in popular music appear in the work of David Forrest ( 2017 ).",

My hearing of verse 1 in E ♭ is supported by its extended marimba introduction that consistently voices A ♭ as the fourth scale degree, and by the tonic pull that E ♭ exerts at the start of each verse. As with Examples 7, 9, and 12 ahead, song structure and other features can give rise to fourth-related ambiguity of tonal center, as described by Stephenson ( 2002 , 47–48). Relatedly, the brief melodic G here presents a little vagueness as to whether the vocal melody’s cadence formula leans more toward an implicit I or V arrival atop the harmonic layer’s IV chord.",

Because the present article introduces a generalized phenomenon of sub-circle motion, I choose to acknowledge each standard paradigm of general possibility without attempts to collapse them. I am sympathetic to de Clercq’s recommendations such as his advocacy of “six-based minor” and the Nashville number system. At this early stage, however, I wish to retain two important considerations regarding sub-circle phenomena. First, Roman numeral notation (including its affordance of the minor tonic i) underscores the way these gestures reinscribe functional tonality—even to a degree that appropriately marks them as old fashioned, per [3.1.6], [3.1.8], and their footnotes. Second, I do not want to flatten certain distinctions between relative reframings, such as the strong hypermetric tendency of II–IV add9 that IV– ♭ VI add9 notably lacks. It is likely that de Clercq’s 2021 theorization of a triple-tonic complex can, by re-slicing categories of pop tonality, contribute to debate, for instance, over whether the sub-circle behavior of Example 6 (“Soul in Isolation” by the Chameleons) more resembles Example 5’s IV– ♭ VI add9 move in a parallel major frame, or Example 3’s II–IV add9 gesture. This is a concern for the future.",

It is true that in Example 14, Starship uses a synthesizer to arpeggiate through the ♭ VII chord’s major seventh, a feature unrequired and even undesired for clarity of stratification, per [1.2.6]. But its sub-circle quality is otherwise robust enough to be undeterred. In those rare moments of the seventh’s inclusion in ♭ VII (usually major, not dominant), the resulting presence of 4 ˆ , 6 ˆ , and 1 ˆ underscore ♭ VII’s capacity for “embodying subdominant aspects,” as Biamonte ( 2010 , 97) has observed. Incidentally, a more complete analysis of “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” would note the previous appearance of ♭ VII during the prechorus as a dominant substitute. It would focus on the direct succession from the deceptive ♭ VII add9 into the first tonic of the proceeding verse. A savvy analyst might even connect the chorus’s prominent melodic use of the fourth scale degree with the ♭ VII chord’s “double plagal” characteristics. And a particularly creative thinker would provide hermeneutics to the double duty of ♭ VII as a substitute for both V (in the prechorus) and I (in the chorus). Specifically, consider how Freudian conceptions of doubleness relate the chord to the duet structure of the song and its role in the 1987 comedy Mannequin , which concerns a dummy coming to life.",

Adjusting this for total frequency within the corpus (60)— ♭ VII’s 748 to vi’s 674— ♭ VII is 2.42 times more likely to proceed to I than vi is.
