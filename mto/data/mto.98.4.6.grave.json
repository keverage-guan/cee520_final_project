He strives not only to retain the unambiguous formal distinctions that constitute both the strength and limitation of Schoenberg’sFormenlehre, but also to fasten them securely to the music of his protagonists: a challenging project that Caplin handles with disquieting aplomb. His demonstration of terminological reform and analytical precision constitutes a noble effort, and despite the Procrustean edge to some of the analyses, there is much in this book that merits notice by scholars concerned with style and compositional technique of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.",

In contrast to Schoenberg, whose rules and\nfunctional categories applied to a broad historical spectrum,\nextending at least from Bach to Brahms, Caplin restricts his study to\nthe high-classical repertory: sonatas, trios, quartets, quintets,\novertures, concertos, and symphonies composed by Haydn, Mozart, and\nBeethoven in the years 1780–1810.  He then proposes a vast elaboration\nof Schoenberg’s categories in an effort to accommodate compositional\ndiversity without losing the theoretical appeal of plausible\ngeneralization.  Embarking on this route, he aims to show how\ninstrumental music by the great classical masters does indeed\nexemplify certain formal archetypes, and that a methodical dissection\nof the archetypes can furnish suitable tools both for analyzing\nspecific compositions and for drawing historically useful conclusions\nabout style.

But perhaps sensing that a frankly\nquantitative approach might lean too far in the direction of style\ndescription rather than theory, he proposes that his categories\n“represent abstractions based on generalized compositional tendencies\nin the classical repertory.  A category is not necessarily meant to\nreflect frequency of occurrence in a statistical sense: it is often\nthe case that relatively few instances in the repertory correspond\nidentically to the complete definition of a given category” (page 4).\nBut by choosing a specific repertory and probing it in close detail,\nhis inquiry inevitably becomes enmeshed with style criticism—and with\nstyle criticism’s shadowy companion, statistics.  At one point, he\nactually does resort to numbers, telling us that about 10 percent of\nclassical minuets resemble small binary (page 220).  Elsewhere, he\nrelies on an abundance of adverbs, including “mostly,” “rarely,”\n“commonly,” and “frequently,” to give an idea of how often certain\nfunctions, patterns, and relationships occur.  Given the author’s\ncomprehensive knowledge of the music in question, readers may\nsometimes wish for more use of numbers.  For example, we read that\n“frequently . . . the composer adds a coda ” (page 179), that “sometimes\nthe notation indicates that the coda starts after the double bar lines\nthat instruct the performer to repeat the development and\nrecapitulation together” (page 181), and that “on occasion, a genuine\ncoda is included in the repeat of the development and recapitulation”\n(page 278, note 8).  “Frequently” tells us that codas are common, while\n“sometimes” and “on occasion” indicate the modest size of specified\nsubcategories within the total number; but this leaves us with the\nqueasy sense that a majority of instances have been left unaccounted\nfor.  True, we can infer a relatively large number of codas in\nmovements where there are no repeat signs for the latter part of the\nmovement, but this subcategory is never identified as such.",

This makes sense from the\nvantage point of Caplin’s method, which typically labels as\n“subordinate theme” not only a (possibly tight-knit) contrasting\nperiod with its own special consistencies of timbre, dynamics, surface\nrhythm, and register, but also a diversity of more loosely organized,\nanticipatory or summarizing functions preceding and following such a\ntheme.  Caplin’s allowances for exceptions and alternatives\nnotwithstanding, the broad “subordinate theme” category tends to\nswallow up potentially important distinctions, for example the not\nunfamiliar option of contrasting an open-ended, expansive primary\ntheme with a stabilizing, closed period in the second key (exemplified\nin the first movements of Mozart’s Piano Concerto in D minor, K. 466,\nand Haydn’s “Reiter” Quartet, Op. 74/3).",

But this is not where Caplin begins\nthe subordinate theme group.  Rather, he places it at bar 28.  Because\nthe thematic statement of bars 28–41 closes with a full cadence in the\ndominant, Caplin’s theory requires him to designate it as a\nsubordinate theme.

But since Caplin’s theory commits him to designating\nbars 28–41 as a first subordinate theme, not merely a dispensable\ntransition, he finds himself explaining the omission in relatively\ncomplicated terms: “Mozart begins the subordinate theme of the\nrecapitulation with material from the second subordinate theme of\nthe exposition . . . He does so presumably to avoid a redundant\nappearance of the main theme’s basic idea in the home key, which would\narise from using the first subordinate theme” (page 169).",

Appearing after\na half cadence in the tonic key, and leading to a half cadence in the\ndominant, this lightly scored material can readily be heard as an\nintroductory gesture, preparing the featured subordinate-theme entry\non the upbeat to bar 81.  But Caplin’s theory obliges him to disagree:\n“Following traditional notions of form, some analysts might see the\ntrue ‘second subject’ as beginning in measure 81 because of the\ncatchier tune and because that idea was also found in the opening\nritornello (measure 20).  But this view ignores the fact that measures 74–80 reside entirely in the new key.  Thus for tonal reasons, as well as\nphrase-structural ones, this passage is consistent with the\ndefinition of a subordinate theme (first part) and should not be\nregarded as belonging to the transition” (page 117).",

To be sure, bars\n74–80 soften the abrupt contrast experienced in the ritornello, but\nnonetheless it seems easier to hear bar 81 as a major structural\narticulation than as merely the start of “a second part to this\nsubordinate theme” begun in bar 74.",

After the transition arrives on the\ndominant of the subordinate key (downbeat of measure 15), a new melodic\nidea, featuring a chromatic stepwise descent, prolongs the half\ncadence by means of another half-cadential progression” (page 114).

Thus the fact that a theme begins in the middle of a notated measure should not, in and of itself, cause\nconfusion. (4) Moreover, Haydn marks the entry of the new theme with a change of register in the cello, which leaps up a tenth on the\nupbeat to beat 3 (i.e., the midbar downbeat).  Arguably, in the\ncontext of an exceptionally subtle and tonally unsettled exposition,\nthe signals are outstandingly clear at this point: a contrasting\nmelodic figure in the first violin and a register shift in the cello\nconfirm the thematic articulation, while other elements lend\ncontinuity and reinforce persisting harmonic tension.

Two of Caplin’s examples from Haydn’s quartets\nstand even further removed from the model: the second movement of\nOp. 76/4 prohibits any confusion by turning unexpectedly from major to\nminor in the first measure of the recapitulation; and the second\nmovement of Op. 50/2 appropriates a design familiar from 18th-century\noperatic practice: ritornello-like passages at the beginning, middle,\nand end of the movement frame the two main sections (analogous to\nexposition and recapitulation), each conceived as an embellished\nviolin solo that culminates in a cadential trill.

                "text": "[20] But ferreting out the notes is a minor annoyance, measured\nagainst the value of this book as a clear and uniquely detailed\npresentation of standard forms and their constituent parts, a\ncompilation of intriguing examples illustrating classical design and\nfunction, an up-to-date bibliographical guide, and a source of fresh\ninsight into the accomplishments of the classical masters.  Caplin’s\napproach, buttressed by methodological rigor and theoretical detail,\nmakes a persuasive case for the revival of Formenlehre as a\npedagogical tool and analytical discipline; but it also underscores\nthe limitations of a method that sometimes enforces Procrustean\nchoices on music that may use convention as much for nuance and\nambiguity as for conformity to functional norms.",
