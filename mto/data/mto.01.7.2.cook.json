    "abstract": "The text-based orientation of traditional musicology and theory hampers thinking about music as a performance art. Music can be understood as both process and product, but it is the relationship between the two that defines “performance” in the Western “art” tradition. Drawing on interdisciplinary performance theory (particularly theatre studies, poetry reading, and ethnomusicology), I set out issues and outline approaches for the study of music as performance; by thinking of scores as “scripts” rather than “texts,” I argue, we can understand performance as a generator of social meaning.",

While performance is an inherently intertextual practice, this argument\napplies with particular force to performance in the age of mechanical\nreproduction; it seems likely that the continued circulation of past\nperformances, in the form of recordings, resulted in individual works acquiring\nincreasingly diversified performance histories. One of the principal problems in\nwriting the history of performance is the extent to which such individual\n“work histories” can be subsumed within a generalized “style\nhistory” (a point discussed by José Bowen, with specific reference to\ntempo, in “Tempo, Duration, and Flexibility: Techniques in the Analysis of\nPerformance,” Journal of Musicological Research 16 (1996), 111–56);\nparadoxically, this suggests a context within which the work concept,\ncomprehensively deconstructed as an aesthetic and analytical category, may need\nto be reinstated as a historical one.",

At stage center, the so-called “New” musicologists\nfocused on the impossibility of understanding music (or any other cultural\nproduction) as truly autonomous, independent of the world within which it is\ngenerated and consumed. Entering from the wings, so to speak, the philosopher\nLydia Goehr developed a critique of the concept of the reified musical work\nwhich had more impact on musicologists than it did on philosophers. (5) In a\nnutshell, she argued that the idea of the musical work (an entity which, in Stan\nGodlovitch’s words, (6) seems “not quite of this world”) is not\nintrinsic to music as a cultural practice, but is a strictly historical concept\nassociated with Western “art” music (hereafter WAM) since around 1800.\nThe idea of conceptualizing music as performance, increasingly central in\nethnomusicology, was not so strongly represented in the musicology of the 1990s,\nor at least not directly so, but in a sense it was already implied in the\ncritique of the autonomous work: if the transcendence and permanence of musical\nworks was not some kind of inherent quality but an effect of social or\nideological construction, it followed that music was to be understood as in\nessence less a product than a process, an intrinsically meaningful cultural\npractice, much in the manner of religious ritual. Indeed one might think of\ntwentieth-century WAM musicians and audiences as jointly “performing”\nmusic’s autonomy, through the ritual of the concert hall, in the same sense that\nthe royal chapels and courts of the seventeenth century “performed”\nmonarchy.",

(There was a suspicion, deriving largely from ethnomusicology, that the\ntraditional musicological insistence on seeing music as product rather than\nprocess represented a kind of cultural hegemony, an assertion of the values of\nhigh over low art.) Another of these tensions had to do with what Glenn Gould\ncontemptuously referred to as “the class structure within the musical\nhierarchy.” (7) In its quest for historically authentic performances, the\nsubdiscipline of performance practice placed the musicologist in the combined\nrole of legislator and law enforcement officer; Richard Taruskin quotes the\ndefinition given in the (old) New Grove Dictionary (performance practice\nis concerned with “the amount and kind of deviation from a precisely\ndetermined ideal tolerated . . . by composers”), and draws out the implied\npremise: “Performers are essentially corrupters—deviants, in\nfact.” (8) As for theorists, the ideal of analytically-informed performance,\nwhich was pursued with some vigor in the decade after the publication of Wallace\nBerry’s book on the subject, similarly placed the analyst in charge: Berry spoke\nof “the path from analysis to performance,” (9) but the chronological\nsequence masks another expression of the hierarchy Gould complained about.

That such a paradigm should be deeply built into musicology is not\nsurprising: the nineteenth-century origins of the discipline lie in an emulation\nof the status and methods of philology and literary scholarship, as a result of\nwhich the study of musical texts came to be modeled on the study of literary\nones. In effect, and however implausibly, we are led to think of music as we\nmight think of poetry, as a cultural practice centered on the silent\ncontemplation of the written text, with performance (like public poetry reading)\nacting as a kind of supplement. Moreover the traditional orientation of\nmusicology towards the reconstruction and dissemination of authoritative texts\nreflected a primary concern with musical works as the works of their composers,\nunderstanding them as messages to be transmitted as faithfully as possible from\ncomposer to audience. It follows then from what Peter Kivy calls “composer\nworship” (10) that the performer becomes at best an intermediary, as\nreflected in the quotation from Leonard Bernstein, and at worst a\n“middleman”: (11) someone who puts a markup on the product without\ncontributing anything to it, and who should accordingly be cut out wherever\npossible (as in the Schoenberg quotation).

[M]usical\nworks, in the listener’s world, simply do not exist.” (17) From this it\nfollows that “musical works are fictions that allow us to speak more\nconveniently about performances,” or as Christopher Small has it, that\n“performance does not exist in order to present musical works, but rather,\nmusical works exist in order to give performers something to perform.” (18) With the idol of the reified work thus overturned, the inversion of the\nperformance “of” paradigm is complete. Whereas, in Small’s almost\nevangelical words, “Western classical music embodies a kind of society that\ndoes not allow for mutual participation of all peoples because it is based upon\nworks, not interactions,” in a more inclusive and creative society there\nshall be “no such thing as a musical work, [but] only the activities of\nsinging, playing, listening [and] dancing.” (19) Indeed, for Michel Chion\nthe “new sound reality” has already arrived, bringing with it a now\n“standard form of listening . . . that is no longer perceived as a\nreproduction, as an image (with all this usually implies in terms of loss and\ndistortion of reality), but as a more direct and immediate contact with the\nevent.” (20) In this brave new world there is in Small’s terminology not\nmusic but musicking, in Taruskin’s not things but acts, (21) in short, not\nproduct but process.

A number of musicologists, among them Harry\nWhite, have responded to Goehr by pointing out how many aspects of the work\nconcept can be traced in WAM prior to that date; Michael Talbot argues that the\nessential transition was not from the absence to the presence of a work concept,\nbut rather from one centered on genre to one centered on the composer. (23) Then\nagain, the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl points out that, if there are such\nthings as universals in music, a strong candidate is that “One does not\nsimply ‘sing,’ but one sings something .” (24) But what matters is the\nvalue that attaches to this something in the processes of performance and\nreception. Robert Martin’s work-free experience of music may occur, but arguably\nnot within the bounds of WAM where, however much you may be focusing on Rattle,\nit is almost impossible to entirely forget that you are listening to Mahler’s\nNinth (or, if you don’t know what you are listening to, not to be wondering what\nit is). When you listen to “Material Girl,” by contrast, the work is\nstill there (though you may well not know that it was written by Peter Brown and\nRobert Rans), but performance values come to the fore: product is no longer so\nclearly separable from process, and there is a sense in which you might want to\nsay it was a different song if another singer covered it. And the so called\n“process” music of the early minimalists represents an even more\nthorough-going dispersal of product (though paradoxically underpinned by a very\ntraditional concept of authorial identity). In this way there is a continuum\nbetween experiencing music as process and as product—a continuum that becomes\ndirectly perceptible, for instance, as the characteristic phrases of “The\nStar-Spangled Banner” emerge from the improvisatory context of Jimi\nHendrix’s Atlanta performance, the sounds as it were condensing onto a\npre-existing musical object and being mentally reconfigured as a flood of\nassociations and connotations are brought into play.

In a kind\nof codicil to her 1992 book, Goehr distinguishes between “the perfect\nperformance of music” (the approach that “takes the ‘of’\nseriously,” as she puts it), and “the perfect musical\nperformance” that “celebrates the ‘lower’ world of the human, the\nephemeral, and the active.” (26) And her point, underscored by several of\nthe contributors to the Liverpool symposium on the musical work that I have\nalready cited, is that the “opus” tradition of nineteenth-century\nmusic associated above all with Beethoven was complemented by a quite distinct,\nperformer-oriented tradition, associated with composer-pianists like Chopin and\nLiszt but even better exemplified by such largely forgotten virtuosi as Thalberg,\nTausig, or (Anton) Rubinstein. If the paradigm of the “opus” tradition\nis the Beethoven symphony, that of the virtuoso tradition is the variation set,\ngenerally based on popular operatic melodies of the day but designed as a\nvehicle for artistic display; if the first tradition is associated with the\nsingle, authoritative text reproduced in performance, the second invokes the\nmultiplicity of texts normative in rock music, for example, but troubling to\nmusicologists trained in the philological tradition. Many of Chopin’s and\nLiszt’s works survive in any number of different, equally authentic notated\nversions, themselves the traces of different, equally authentic performances\n(and the resonance with the Jamaican usage of ‘version’ to refer to the\nintertextual practices of reggae is not inappropriate). If, to repeat Small’s\nwords, musicking means that “musical works exist in order to give\nperformers something to perform,” then there was musicking even within the\nheartland of the musical work.

No one performance exhausts all the possibilities of a\nmusical work within the WAM tradition, and to this extent the performance might\nbe thought of as a subset of a larger universe of possibility. But a better way\nof thinking this thought is that, as Godlovitch puts it, “works massively\nunderdetermine their performances.” (28) There are decisions of dynamics and\ntimbre which the performer must make but which are not specified in the score;\nthere are nuances of timing that contribute essentially to performance\ninterpretation and that involve deviating from the metronomically-notated\nspecifications of the score. In ensemble music such unnotated but musically\nsignificant values are negotiated between performers (that is a large part of\nwhat happens in rehearsal). And as Kivy has observed, (29) there is a distinction\nof scale but not of principle between such interpretive practices, which happen\nso to speak within the interstices of notation, and the more drastic\nreconfigurations of the score that are normal in the performance of a Corelli\nviolin sonata (where the continuo player will realize the figured bass and the\nsoloist may embellish the melody out of all recognition), or in the\ninterpretation of a jazz lead sheet: in each case the art of performance\ninhabits a zone of free and yet musically significant choice that is established\nin and around the notated work. (Kivy refers to this as the “gap between\n‘text’ and performance,” describing it as “a desired , intended and logically required ontological fact.” (30) ) In fact it might be\nargued that music is projected most strongly as an art of performance precisely\nwhen the work itself is so familiar, so over-learned, that the individual\nperformance becomes the principal focus of the listener’s attention. If, as\npessimistic commentators complain, the live orchestral repertory has diminished\nto a handful of interminably repeated war-horses, then the result is a culture\noriented in the highest possible degree towards the experience of music as\nperformance (which explains the importance of brand marketing in the classical\nmusic industry: it isn’t so much Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony that is being\nsold, but rather the difference between Harnoncourt’s and John Eliot Gardiner’s\ninterpretations of it). (31) If that is the case, then there is a striking\nmismatch between the largely performance-oriented manner in which such music is\nexperienced and the almost exclusively composer- or composition-oriented manner\nin which it is represented in historical and critical writing.",

First, by referring to\ntraditional performance, Kivy intends a contrast with the so-called historical\nperformance movement, which he sees as collapsing performance into text, so\nsqueezing out the gap between them and substituting one artwork for two. (33) (The same might be said for wholly studio-based electroacoustic music.) The\nsecond has to do with Kivy’s curious formulation “the performance (product)\nitself,” which he elsewhere glosses as “the ‘thing’ the performer\nproduces in the act of performing.” (34) Exactly what this “thing”\nmight be is never entirely clear, but Kivy provides a clue when he refers to the\nquality that persists through Landowska’s various performances of the\n“Goldberg” Variations: performance is to be valued not as process but\nfor the interpretation it embodies. (35) Again, Kivy argues that performances are\nversions of works in precisely the same sense as arrangements, (36) and this\nmeans that he treats performance as a vicarious kind of composition; indeed he\nclaims that “Western performance practice tout court is the exercise\nof a peripheral skill of the composer’s art.” (37) Leaving aside the\nhierarchical implications of “peripheral,” the result is exactly what\nKivy’s reference to “two artworks” suggests: we have two products and\nno process. In this way, we are back to music and performance, rather\nthan music as performance. Music as Performance",

The contemporary\nperformance studies paradigm that has developed primarily in the context of\ntheater studies and ethnomusicology stresses the extent to which signification\nis constructed through the very act of performance, and generally through acts\nof negotiation between performers, or between them and the audience. In other\nwords performative meaning is understood as subsisting in process and hence by\ndefinition irreducible to product; as Charles Bernstein expresses it with\nreference to poetry reading, “Sound . . . can never be completely recuperated as ideas, as content, as narrative, as extralexical\nmeaning.” (39) In many ways musicology’s faltering advance towards a\nperformance studies paradigm, most visible perhaps in opera studies (where the\nconcept of the operatic “work” has largely given way to that of the\noperatic event), replicates the breaking away of theater studies from literary\nstudies that took place during the last generation.

Referring to one of the mostly\novertly interactive of musical practices, jazz improvisation, Ingrid Monson\nwrites that “the formal features of musical texts are just one aspect—a\nsubset, so to speak—of a broader sense of the musical, which also includes the\ncontextual and the cultural. Rather than being conceived as foundational or\nseparable from context, structure is taken to have as one of its central\nfunctions the construction of social context.” (42) Seen this way,\nthe term “text” (with its connotations of New Critical autonomy and\nstructuralism) is perhaps less helpful than a more distinctively theatrical\nword, “script.” Whereas to think of a Mozart quartet as a\n“text” is to construe it as a half-sonic, half-ideal object reproduced\nin performance, to think of it as a “script” is to see it as\nchoreographing a series of real-time, social interactions between players: a\nseries of mutual acts of listening and communal gestures that enact a particular\nvision of human society, the communication of which to the audience is one of\nthe special characteristics of chamber music (the reproductive aspect is\narguably stronger in symphonic music). (43) It is in recognition of this kind of\nperformative meaning that non-musicological writers have often advocated the\nsame kind of retrenchment in the concept of the musical work that motivates my\nuse of the term “script”; Paul Valéry compared a piece of music to a\nrecipe, R. G. Collingwood saw the score as a “rough outline” of\ndirections for performance, while Godlovitch refers to notated works as\n“templates, sketches, outlines, or guides which, when consulted within the\nbounds of conventional approval, hold promise for workable and working\nmusic.” (44)",

Rather, it implies a reorientation of the relationship between notation\nand performance. The traditional model of musical transmission, borrowed from\nphilology, is the stemma: a kind of family tree in which successive\ninterpretations move vertically away from the composer’s original vision. The\ntext, then, is the embodiment of this vision, and the traditional aim of source\ncriticism is to ensure as close an alignment as possible between the two, just\nas the traditional aim of historically-informed performance is to translate the\nvision into sound. But the performance studies paradigm in effect turns this\nmodel through ninety degrees: as Richard Schechner expresses it, it emphasizes\n“explorations of horizontal relationships among related forms rather\nthan a searching vertically for unprovable origins.” (45) In other words, it\nseeks to understand performances in relation to other performances (Schechner’s\n“related forms”) rather than in relation to the original vision\nsupposedly embodied in an authoritative text; a given performance of Beethoven’s\nNinth Symphony, for example, acquires its meaning from its relationship to the\nhorizon of expectations established by other performances. (It is easy to\nrecognize this in relation to such obviously anomalous interpretations as\nMengelberg’s, but I am suggesting that the same applies to all performances, so that if we hear Karajan’s Ninth as simply a performance\n“of” the Ninth that is because we are unconscious of the weight of\ntradition within which we are immersed.

Charles Bernstein invokes Alfred Lord’s study of the\nHomerian epic in order to oppose the reduction of poem to text: “I\nbelieve,” wrote Lord, “that once we know the facts of oral composition\nwe must cease to find an original of any traditional song. From an oral\npoint of view each performance is original .” (48) And Godlovitch sees\nthe related practice of story-telling as the best model for musical performance,\nnot only because it emphasizes presentation, skill, and communication, but also\nbecause “this view of the relationship between works and performances puts\nthe former in their proper musical place primarily as vehicles and opportunities\nfor the latter in the larger business of making music.” (49) Godlovitch’s\nformulation, however, would be more accurate if he spoke of the relationship\nbetween “scripts,” not works, and performances: after all, if there is\nno original, or if as Lord puts it each performance is original, then instead of\na single work located “vertically” in relation to its performances we\nhave an unlimited number of ontologically equivalent instantiations, all\nexisting on the same “horizontal” plane. Again the story-telling model\nshows what is at stake: Barbara Herrnstein Smith’s demonstration that there is\nno such thing as “the” story of Cinderella but only an\nindefinite number of versions of it (paralleled by Charles Seeger’s judgment\nthat “no such entity as ‘ the ”Barbara Allen“ tune’ can be\nset up other than for temporary convenience”) suggests that the only viable\nmodel for the musical work is the Wittgensteinian “family\nresemblances” one, and indeed a number of musicologists have invoked family\nresemblances in this context.

I have two answers to this question. The first,\nwhich might seem rather quibbling, is that there is no such thing as Beethoven’s\ntext, except as in interpretive construct; there is an autograph score, there\nare a few autograph parts and a larger number of non-autograph ones, and a\nvariety of copyists’ scores, but all of them contradict one another to a greater\nor lesser degree. And to see this as the kind of transient difficulty that can\nbe put right by a proper critical edition is to miss the point: Herrnstein Smith\nwould say that the Urtext editions of Beethoven’s symphonies that are at\nlast beginning to appear do not replace the earlier texts, but just add new\nones. (So perhaps this answer was not so quibbling after all.) The second answer\nis that while these historically privileged texts have a particular significance\nand authority within the field encompassed by the Ninth Symphony, they are not\nontologically distinct from any other occupant of that field: scores and\nperformances, with their different patterns of determinacy and indeterminacy,\ntheir different construals of what is essential or inessential to the Symphony’s\nidentity, are linked to one another only by virtue of acts of interpretation,\nresulting in just the kind of intertextual field to which Keir Elam referred.\n(It is because the relationship of score to performance necessarily involves\ninterpretation that even WAM might be seen as essentially an oral tradition, no\nmatter how closely prompted by notation.) In a passage which I have quoted so\noften that I might as well quote it once more, Lawrence Rosenwald has\ncharacterized the identity of the Ninth Symphony as “something existing in\nthe relation between its notation and the field of its performances,” (51) and this precisely captures what I am trying to convey: that Beethoven’s text\n(whatever that means) has an obviously privileged role and yet relates\nhorizontally, as Schechner would put it, to the symphony’s other instantiations.\nIn other words, the work does not exist “above” the field of its\ninstantiations, but is simply coterminous with its totality—which, of course,\nis why the Ninth Symphony is still evolving. There is a sense, then, in which to\nrefer (like Godlovitch) to “work and performance” is just as\nwrong-headed as speaking of “music and performance.”",

Seen this way, process and product\nform an insoluble amalgam: Andrew Benjamin speaks, with reference to poetry, of\n“[t]he presence of the text . . . within the performance but equally the\npresence of the performance inside the text,” (54) and the same applies to\nmusic. But it is in the case of recordings that product and process have become\nmost inextricably intertwined. The recording (a marketable product) purports to\nbe the trace of a performance (process), but is in reality usually the composite\nproduct of multiple takes and more or less elaborate sound processing—in other\nwords, less a trace than the representation of a performance that never actually\nexisted.

Richard Middleton has\nappropriated Bakhtin’s concepts for the analysis of popular music, linking them\nto Henry Louis Gates Jr’s concept of “Signifyin(g)”; Monson has made\nthe same linkage in connection with the tissue of intertextual reference that is\njazz improvisation, also adding W. E. B. Du Bois’s concept of African-American\n“double-consciousness” into the mix. (70) Such approaches not only add\ndepth to such concepts as parody, irony, and the rest, but also throw the\nemphasis firmly on the quality of creativity, of performative difference, which\nGates invokes when he defines Signifyin(g) as “[r]epetition with a signal\ndifference”; (71) this semiotically charged figuring of iteration as\ncommentary, ventriloquism, or even impersonation lies at the heart of, for\ninstance, Hendrix’s Monterey covers of “Like a Rolling Stone” or\n“Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” (72) That approaches such as\nthese, developed for the articulation of characteristic features of\nAfrican-American culture, should be well adapted for the analysis of jazz and\npopular music is not surprising. I would go further, however, and suggest that\njust as the spread of African-American musical practices has gone far towards\nestablishing a global lingua franca , so the concepts of Signifyin(g) and\ndouble-consciousness can help to articulate the creativity that has always been\npresent in the performance culture of WAM, but has long been repressed by the\ntext-dominated discourses of musicology. Or to put it another way, thinking of\nWAM performances as reproductions may be less useful than thinking of them as\nmonolithic, culturally privileged instances of intertextual reference.",

(75) As Titon puts\nit, citing Geertz, the performative approach “forces us to face the fact\nthat we are primarily authors, not reporters.” (76)",

For the drama\ntheorist Baz Kershaw, it is “a fundamental tenet of performance theory . .\n. that no item in the environment of performance can be discounted as irrelevant\nto its impact,” and Charles Bernstein provides an all too graphic\nillustration of what this might mean when he characterizes “gasps,\nstutters, hiccups, burps, coughs, slurs, microrepetitions, oscillations in\nvolume, ‘incorrect’ pronunciations, and so on” as “semantic features\nof the performed poem . . . and not as extraneous interruption.” (77) The\npoint Bernstein is making is that “one of the primary techniques of poetry\nperformance is the disruption of rationalizable patterns of sound through the\nintervallic irruption of acoustic elements not recuperable by monological\nanalysis,” (78) and one might say that in music the performance\n“of” paradigm—the equivalent of Bernstein’s “monological\nanalysis”—filters out such dimensions of performance as are not directly referable\nto the work being performed. An ethnographic approach, by contrast, seeks to\nunderstand the performance of a particular piece in the context of the total\nperformance event, encompassing issues of program planning, stage presentation,\ndress, articulation with written texts, and so forth. To date, work of this kind\nis more familiar in the context of popular music than of WAM, and the work of\nLes Back offers a representative example which parallels both Kisliuk’s\nself-consciously performative writing and, in its invocation of Deleuze and\nGuattari’s cultural “rhizomes,” Schechner’s concept of the horizontal:\nBack shows by such means how the performances of the Birmingham (U.K.)-based\nmusician Apache Indian function as an arena for complex negotiations of cultural\nidentity reflecting, as he puts it, “a diasporic triple consciousness that is simultaneously the child of Africa, Asia, and Europe.” (79)",

How might we put the music\nback into performance analysis? One model is provided by Monson’s analyses of\njazz improvisation, in which extended transcriptions are aligned with prose\ncommentary and counterpointed by quotations from and discussions of performers’\ndiscourse. (The main limitation in Monson’s presentation is the distance between\nsound and transcription: a musicology of performance really demands the\nintegration of sound, word, and image achievable through current hypermedia\ntechnology, though inhibited by copyright and implementation costs,\ndistribution, and the criteria of academic accreditation.) Again, the kind of\ncommunicative interaction between performers that Chris Smith has analyzed in\nrelation to Miles Davis (80) is equally evident within the dynamics of, to repeat\nmy previous example, a string quartet playing Mozart: here there is an\nopportunity to combine ethnographic and traditional music-theoretical\napproaches, as well as the computer-based measurement of timing to which I have\nalready referred, in an analysis of the relationship between notated\n“script” and social interaction. (If this kind of work is harder with\nthe WAM repertory than with jazz improvisation, because of the danger of\nrelapsing into the performance “of” paradigm, then a useful halfway\nhouse is offered by analysis of the longitudinal processes by which WAM\ninterpretations come into being, that is, of rehearsal; this is a topic already\nattracting interest from music theorists, psychologists, and sociologists,\nthough still primarily at the level of grant applications and work-in-progress\npresentations.)",

The underlying\nobjective of such a musicology—to understand music as both reflection and\ngenerator of social meaning—is most ambitiously expressed in Adorno’s claim\nthat music “presents social problems through its own material and according\nto its own formal laws—problems which music contains within itself in the\ninnermost cells of its technique.” (84) Music, in other words, becomes a\nresource for understanding society. Adorno’s own analyses of music have proved a\nconstant source of frustration, however, while even his apologist Rose Subotnik\nhas described his concept of the interface between music and society as\n“indirect, complex, unconscious, undocumented, and mysterious.” (85) But the problem disappears if instead of seeing musical works as texts within\nwhich social structures are encoded we see them as scripts in response to which\nsocial relationships are enacted: the object of analysis is now present and\nself-evident in the interactions between performers, and in the acoustic trace\nthat they leave.
