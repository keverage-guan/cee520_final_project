    "abstract": "The best-known track on Kendrick Lamar’sTo Pimp a Butterfly, “Alright” has come to be regarded as a protest anthem, fueled by Lamar’s charged performances of the song at the BET Awards and the Grammys, and by accolades from the press that cite its political importance. This article argues that the actual musical track is ambiguous and open to several interpretations. To support this idea, I first explore the process through which the track came into being and how this process may have contributed to the song’s ambiguity. I then examine the message of “Alright,” contextualizing its place in the concept album and in the music video. I closely examine the musical track, analyzing its accent patterns using the metrical preference rules of Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) and David Temperley (2001). This analysis of the track implies a 3+5 or 3+2+3 beat reading of the meter in addition to a straight44. Using the linguistic tool Praat, I analyze the ways in which rappers Fabolous (who originally recorded on the track) and Lamar respond to this meter in their stresses, rhythms, and rhymes. I examine the well-known hook, which Pharrell Williams raps with a striking rise in pitch. This rise lends itself to several possible interpretations, due to differences in intonation between African American English and standard American English, coupled with Williams’s fluency in both. Finally, I analyze the ways that protesters have performed and interpreted the hook differently from the recording, as an illustration of the multivalent nature of the work.",

Indeed, in popular music, the bass note is often played a fraction of the tactus earlier than the downbeat, typically by an eighth note in a fast 4 4 , in what Peter Manuel ( 1985 ) dubs the “anticipated bass” in his study of Cuban music. In more direct relevance to hip hop, funk—a frequent source of samples and inspiration for hip hop—also uses anticipated downbeats. Anne Danielsen describes the legendary beat 1 of funk as “a heavy One, which is in fact set on the preceding four” ( 2006 , 121–122). These anticipated downbeats can be heard not only in the bass but in other instruments, such as the guitar or keyboards. As these anticipations are part of these and other genres’ styles and are understood to be syncopated, forward displacements of the downbeat, I treat such anticipations as if they were on the downbeat, following Temperley’s procedure.",

Subcycles are drawn on the interior of the N-cycle and are at a higher structural level. London’s WFCs are as follows: WFC 1: The interonset intervals on the N-cycle must be nominally isochronous and at least 100 ms. WFC 2: Each cycle and its subcycles must be continuous. WFC 3: The N-cycle and all subcycles must be in phase. WFC 4: The N-cycle and all subcycles must all span the same amount of time, with the maximum span for a cycle being five seconds.

Robin Kelley ( 1996 , 210) has written that gangsta rappers of the 1990s were revisioning “nigga” to speak “to a collective identity shaped by class consciousness, the character of inner-city space, police repression, poverty, and the constant threat of intraracial violence . . . almost as a synonym for oppressed.” As of the 2010s, Rahman notes that the word is commonly used as a term of self-reference among the black community, to represent awareness of African American history and build solidarity through shared experiences related to survival. She notes that using the term reappropriates the racist word to project an image as resourceful survivors. Miles White ( 2011 , 72) notes that “when hardcore and thug rappers self-identify as ‘niggas,’ there is inherent in it a sense of inverting this rhetorical pejorative; self-defining themselves by it but subverting both its meaning and spelling . . . [it] converts the existential wound that induces shame and emasculation into a signifying trope of racial power, community, and resistance.” Tupac Shakur, whom Lamar samples at the end of To Pimp a Butterfly , reinterpreted the term as “Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished” ( Kelley 1996 , 210; Williams 2018 , 309). In the penultimate track “i,” Lamar reinterprets the N word as “negus,” which he defines as “royalty.”",

It has garnered numerous accolades, including Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2016 Grammys ( Rolling Stone 2016 ) and several best-of-2015 lists. (1) Much of the praise stems from the song’s political import. In its summary of the song for the Best Hip-Hop Songs list, Billboard notes its presence in Black Lives Matter and the Million Man March, adding, “it would be criminal to overlook the social struggle that K.Dot [Lamar] captured from the frontlines with ‘Alright’” ( Platon and Rhys 2015 ). As Matthew Schnipper ( 2015 ) notes in Pitchfork , “It has soundtracked a movement.” Generally interpreted as a message of hope during a dark time, the song has been called the “unofficial anthem of the Black Lives Matter movement”( O’Connor 2017 ), the “New Black National Anthem” to replace “Lift Every Voice and Sing” ( Harris 2015 ) and this generation’s “We Shall Overcome,” making it “the most important rap record of the decade so far” ( Garrett 2015 ).",

Jayson Greene ( 2015 ) of Pitchfork commented, “[Pharrell Williams, who raps the hook,] doesn’t sound . . . even particularly convinced.” Indeed, Lamar’s “Alright” was not the first version of this track: the rapper Fabolous had previously recorded a version, while the background track was produced in multiple stages between Pharrell Williams, the original producer, and Sounwave (Mark Spears, in-house producer for Top Dawg Entertainment, Lamar’s record label). The song has acquired its meaning in the process of making, then remaking the track; its inclusion into a concept album; and the meanings added through the paratext of music videos, Lamar’s performances, comments to the press, and general persona as an artist. As originally conceived by the producer, it could have a more complex and subtle meaning than the message of hope that the public has bestowed on it.",

The multiplicity of sonic, visual, and paratextual inputs provides the potential for conflicting interpretations, yet the public has chosen the “we strong” interpretation (Lamar’s words), as evidenced by the song’s adoption in protests. I begin by discussing the meaning of the lyrics within the context of the entire album, and the ways in which the music video and Lamar’s performances have highlighted a few aspects of the lyrics, shifting the meaning of the song. After setting up the analysis with preliminary discussions of metrical preference rules and choice of tactus, I examine the ambiguities in the musical track by comparing two potentially different metrical interpretations— 4 4 and 4 3 + 4 5 (or 4 3 + 4 2 + 4 3 )—and the ways in which the rappers Fabolous, Williams, and Lamar interpret this ambiguity. The intonational aspects of the hook are then analyzed, considering the multiple ways they can be interpreted. I then address the metrical simplifications in protesters’ chants of the hook. Finally, I contemplate the factors that led to its transformation into a political anthem. 2. The process of the song’s creation",

Pharrell Williams produced the original version of the track and gave it to the rapper Fabolous, who added a rap track. Williams previewed Fabolous’s version at the Fool’s Gold Rap Party in January 2014—over a year before Butterfly was released. Sometime after this party, Williams was persuaded to play the loop for Lamar and Sounwave, who decided to record their own version. Sounwave later added drums and saxophone to the original track. As he puts it: [The “Alright” beat] was there, but it was not all there, vibe-wise, so that was my job to layer in the drums, get Terrace [Martin] to throw some sax riffs on it , and make it us. It’s a completely different song than the original . . . . You just have to have your ears open for every little sound that has potential ( Bowman 2015 , emphasis mine).",

Eventually, “Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant / Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations / That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle.” The concepts behind these metaphors of the pimp, the consuming caterpillar, the cocoon, and the free butterfly appear in varying degrees across all songs of Butterfly .

He can neither escape the expectations of his community nor deal with being alienated from the people there. Suicidally depressed, he drowns himself in alcohol in a hotel room.

The central theme of struggle is introduced at the outset with the quote, “Alls my life I has to fight,” from Alice Walker’s The Color Purple . (12) Many of the struggles that Lamar addresses in his verses are personal—the caterpillar’s materialism, in the form of painkillers, sex, and money. By the last four lines of the first verse, he seems content to be drowning in his vices, mock-singing that “it’s too late” and that he’s “gone cray.” The second verse finds himself reaching for redemption. He introduces Lucy (named as Lucifer in the music video) as temptress, quoting Uncle Sam’s exact same lines from “Wesley’s Theory,” the opening track: What you want you: a house or a car? Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar? Anything, see my name is Lucy, I’m your dog Motherfucker, you can live at the mall. In “Wesley’s Theory,” Uncle Sam may represent American capitalism, for whom Lamar is “the dollar in you,” and encourages him to spend his money; Uncle Sam may also stand for the government, empowered to give suddenly rich African Americans like Wesley Snipes their comeuppance (through a conviction for tax fraud, in Snipes’s case). Through quotation, Lamar equates Lucy as temptress-devil with Uncle Sam, drawing parallels between American capitalism and consumerism, on one hand, and evil and social oppression, on the other. The phrase “forty acres and a mule” refers to promises of land ownership made but largely unfulfilled to former slaves after the Civil War; it indexes the song to the history of oppression of African Americans and the unkept promises that society has made to them. Hence, materialism is another “forty acres and a mule,” a false promise that will not bring personal happiness or socio-political parity. Lamar recognizes the evil (“I can see the evil”) and the unlimited nature of material wants (“ain’t a profit big enough to feed you”). He eventually regains control by trusting in God (“Heaven, I can reach you,” “I write ’til I’m right with God”). It is one inflection point in the album, at which Lamar rejects the caterpillar mentality and takes a step toward his transformation into a butterfly. As in much of his oeuvre, Lamar thus calls on inner strength as a way of dealing with the state domination and systemic forces that are hostile to black bodies ( Love 2016 ). (13)",

In Compton, police brutality has long been extant, exacerbated by the war on drugs and the militarization of the police, and it is a common topic among South Central Los Angeles rappers, most famously NWA’s “Fuck the Police” ( Kelley 1996 ; Kajikawa 2015 ). No stranger to police use of excessive force, Lamar had previously recounted his personal experience with the police in the track, “good kid” (2012), about the challenges of growing up harassed by gang members, profiled by the police, and surrounded by drugs. (14) As he explained in a self-penned essay in XXL : The past few years or so have been very politically charged and controversial. From Trayvon Martin, to Eric Garner to Michael Brown and issues of police brutality and racism and for so many other reasons. All of it has really struck a nerve with me because when you experience things like that personally and you know the type of hardships and pain that it brings first-hand, it builds a certain rage in you. It brings back memories of when I’m 16 and the police come kicking the door in. They don’t care that I’m a little boy and they stumped me in my back two times and they dragged me out the house and have us all handcuffed. It brings back those memories ( Lamar 2015a ).",

He rapped “The Blacker the Berry,” an angry track about institutionalized racism from the album, (20) with not much more accompaniment than a saxophone, before transitioning into a performance of “Alright” around a bonfire, a melding of the celebratory aspects of the track with an imagined Africa. According to Africanist Salim Faraji, Lamar thus pointed out that “Africa is in Compton and Compton is in Africa”—that is, that the struggle for racial equality in the U.S. is “more precisely a battle for the assertion of African power,” a pan-Africanist philosophy embraced by Kwame Ture and other activist leaders of the 1960s–70s ( Faraji 2016 , 3–4). Perhaps the most direct tie to Black Lives Matter was an unreleased rap he performed at the end, referring to Trayvon Martin: “On February 26th I lost my life too . . . / Set us back another 400 years / This is modern day slavery.” (21) Given such powerful and symbolic visuals in the music video and high-profile performances, coupled with a few lyrics in the song itself, it is easy to see how “Alright” would be interpreted as a protest song for Black Lives Matter. But the original track and hook, as conceived by Williams, is more ambiguous. 4. Preliminary considerations in analyzing the meter of “Alright” Must rap be in 4 4 and in duple subdivisions?",

                "text": "[4.1] A major source of ambiguity in “Alright” is the meter, which can be interpreted in ways other than a straight 4 4 . This characteristic marks it as unusual in rap, the repertoire of which is overwhelmingly in 4 4 . (22) Nonetheless, there are examples of hip hop in meters other than 4 4 or in divisions other than two, raising the possibility of alternative metrical interpretations. Triplets are common, particularly since Migos’s “ Versace ” (2013) made rapping in continuous triplets to a 4 4 beat the rage in trap, a hip hop style originally from Atlanta. But rappers had flowed in triplets well before Migos: Chuck D raps the second verse of “ Bring the Noise ” (1987) in triplets. There are also numerous examples of triple ( 4 3 , 8 3 ) or compound meters (like 8 6 or 8 12 ), including Gang Starr’s “ Stay Tuned ” (1992) or Kanye West’s “ Spaceship ” (2004). Tracks in 4 5 or 8 5 include the Flobots’ “ Jet Pack ” (2005), El-P’s “ Dear Sirs ” (2007), and Captain Murphy’s “ Gone Fishing ” (featuring Jeremiah Jae, 2012); “Meet Me Inside” from Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Broadway musical Hamilton is in 8 7 . In some cases, a loop consists mostly of 4 4 measures with an irregular measure inserted, such as the added bar of 4 2 in Outkast’s “ Hey Ya ” (2003) or the added bar of 4 3 in the Roots’ “ Ital ” (1996). Rappers often respond by adjusting rhyme schemes or flow to account for the irregular grouping, although not always ( Ohriner 2017 ). (23) Moreover, EDM—which, like hip hop, is also constructed from loops—has many examples of metrically dissonant layers, where, say, a 3+3+2 grouping is laid over a 4 4 structure ( Butler 2006 , 155–75). While the additive-meter examples above might be considered experimental rather than mainstream, the hip hop genre has precedents for non- 4 4 meters and non-duple divisions, making it entirely possible that “Alright” could be interpreted in a metric grouping other than a straight 4 4 . Can one use metrical preference rules in hip hop?",

Lerdahl and Jackendoff ( 1983 ) interpret musical structures as hierarchical (composed of grouping, meter, time-span reduction, and prolongational reduction) and propose, for each level, well-formedness rules (which define a set of possible structures) and preference rules (which are the criteria for choosing the optimal reading out of the possibilities). For metrical preference rules (MPR), they list ten, which they refrain from ranking. (24) Nonetheless, the stronger rules include preferences for a metrical structure in which a strong beat coincides with a long duration of a harmony (MPR 5f), suspensions are on stronger beats than resolutions (MPR 8), the bass is metrically stable (MPR 6), and cadences are metrically stable (MPR 7; 1983 , chapter 4). Using Lerdahl and Jackendoff as a starting point, David Temperley ( 1999 , 2001 ) has produced another set of metrical preference rules, eliminating Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s stable-bass rule in favor of a stable harmony rule (Temperley’s MPR 6, noted as “MPR 6 T ” from here on) and adding a linguistic-stress rule (MPR 8 T ), among other adjustments.

To open the possibility of applying the rules to other musical idioms, Lerdahl and Jackendoff give a brief example of Macedonian and Bulgarian folk music, which tends to be in additive meters. David Temperley ( 1999 , 2001 ) applies his metrical preference rules to rock and African music. (26)",

I have found that the most important of Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s MPRs for determining meter in hip hop are the long duration of a harmony (MPR 5f) and a stable bass (MPR 6), followed by the inception of long pitch events (MPR 3), corresponding to MPR 6 T (harmony) and MPR 2 T (length) in Temperley. These rules reflect the ways in which rappers determine their flow: they usually listen to the bass or drums as a guide, sometimes substituted for a keyboard or guitar. As Big Pooh of hip hop group Little Brother told Paul Edwards, “Whether it’s the bass line or it’s drums or a piano, I always end up picking out something that I use as my guide” ( Edwards 2009 , 115). And while producers like Pete Rock regard the drums as foundational ( Manabe 2008 ), many rappers find the bass to be the key factor. As rapper Gift of Gab from hip hop duo Blackalicious says, “I’m basically trying to be like another instrument on the track. I want to ride it like the bass line is riding it” ( Edwards 2009 , 115). Hence, the bass, and by extension, harmonies, are an important determinant of flow and the perception of rhythm. What is the tactus for “Alright”?",

Justin London notes that the tactus is the level of pulse that anchors the metric hierarchy ( 2012 , 30–33). Lerdahl and Jackendoff define tactus as “one specially designated metrical level . . . with which one most naturally coordinates foot-tapping and dance steps” ( 1983 , 71). In hip hop, this level of beat is typically the one under which the fastest common subdivision in the rapper’s performance occurs. According to London, the maximum number of subdivisions is six, which he finds the “practical limit for subdivision in Western musical practice” ( London 2012 , 134). This subdivision is typically four sixteenth notes in duple meter, while in recent trap-style hip hop, it is either triplets or sextuplets. This convention of rapping sixteen notes to a four-beat measure is evident in the way that Paul Edwards ( 2009 , 69), Adam Krims ( 2000 , 59), and Kyle Adams ( 2009 ) have drawn their flow diagrams. It is in line with what individual rappers have told me in interviews (e.g., Zeebra, personal communication, August 2005; Darth Reider, personal communication, July 2005). It is also typically the beat to which casual dancers sway and listeners tap their feet.",

It would correspond to the pulse of the four repeating chords at the beginning of the track, which is Williams’s signature introduction, as well as the constant hits on the hi-hat. It also results in an interval of 536 milliseconds (ms) from beat to beat, which, per London ( 2012 , 57), is in the zone of 500–700 ms periodicity (120–86 bpm) upon which humans prefer to hear beats. (27) Taking this 536 ms interval to be the quarter note, the eighth notes (corresponding to the speed of “We gon’” in “Alright”) would be at 268 ms, a threshold speed at which we can still feel a beat; the sixteenth notes would be 134 ms, approaching the 120 ms limit for comprehending vocal articulation ( London 2012 , 27–35). Note that the sixteenth note is the shortest unit that is frequently and consistently used in the track; this would argue against the half note, at 56 bpm, as the tactus, as the eight subdivisions (consisting of the sixteenth notes) would exceed London’s limit of six. Hence, the 536-ms interval is the most sensible tactus and quarter note. (28) 5.

Furthermore, the move to the Gm9 is heard as a cadence, and to keep the cadence more metrically stable (MPR 7), one could be inclined to hear beat 4 as a downbeat to a second measure. In contrast, the drum pattern repeats in a 4 4 framework ( Example 2 ); however, it lacks a heavy bass drum on what would be beat 1 in the second measure of a 4 4 framework, (29) leaving nothing to counteract the feeling of beat 4 as a downbeat-like accent. This is in contrast to Migos’s “Versace” (2013), where the on-beat handclaps (in the context of a sparse track) reinforce the 4 4 meter when the second chord anticipates the downbeat. A listener of “Alright” is less likely to hear beat 4 as a syncopation as she would in “Versace,” as so many stresses (harmonies, chords, bass notes) coincide on beat 4, the tactus is on the quarter note, and there is nothing in the music on that beat that reinforces the next downbeat of a 4 4 meter.

(33) First, the vocals on the recording were isolated using PhonicMind, (34) before analyzing them through Praat. Pitch frequencies were taken around the highest intensity (volumes) of the vowel of the syllable, and peak frequencies and peak volumes were compared between the vocal syllable in question and the syllables before and after it.

The just-noticeable difference (“jnd,” the threshold at which one hears a difference) in pitch for speech has been determined to be between 1 and 1.5 semitones by Hart ( 1981 ) and 7 Hz by Jongman et al. ( 2017 ). The dotted line on the graph reflects Jongman’s jnd, which at Faboloso’s average pitch peak would be a ratio of 1.036. As shown in Example 6a, in ten out of thirteen cases, the pitches on downbeats in 3+2+3 are higher than those of neighboring syllables by more than Jongman’s jnd, and nine out of thirteen exceed them by Hart’s jnd. Furthermore, the word “Get” is highlighted by being pitched more than a jnd below the preceding pitch. Second, I compared the intensity (in dB) of the 3+2+3 downbeats against their neighboring syllables by subtracting the neighboring syllable’s dB ( Example 6b ). At 80 dB, the jnd threshold of volume difference is 0.5 dB (Forinash and Christian 2019), which is drawn into Example 6b. Eleven out of thirteen downbeats in 3+2+3 are more than 0.5 dB louder than their neighboring syllables. Third, I compared the duration of the 3+2+3 downbeats against their neighboring syllables, taking the onset-to-onset duration in sixteenth notes and examining the difference. Seven out of thirteen downbeats in 3+2+3 are longer than their neighbors ( Example 6c ). (35) Hence, every 3+2+3 downbeat is accented by at least one, and mostly two or more, criteria among pitch, loudness, and duration. Fabolous’s delivery thus confirms a 3+2+3 grouping. Example 6b .

However, I am particularly interested in how Fabolous treats pulses that are downbeats in 3+2+3 but are the relatively weak beat 4 in a 4 4 scheme, which one might normally expect to sound like a pickup to beat 1, building to the rhyme placement on beat 2. As Examples 6a, 6b, and 6c show, he accents them by pitch, volume, and duration. The word “so” (m. 1, beat 4 in 4 4 ), “how” (m. 3, beat 4), “fuck(er)” (m. 5, beat 4), and “stay” (m. 7, beat 4) are pronounced at a pitch about 1.5, 1, 0.3, and 4 semitones above the previous syllable, at or above the jnd in pitch in speech. “Stay” sounds particularly accented, as it is pronounced not only at a higher pitch but also at a maximum volume of 80 dB vs. 77.4 dB for the preceding syllable. This 2.6 dB difference is much larger than the jnd of 0.5dB, making “stay” sound like an accent; this can be seen visibly on the Praat graph ( Example 7 ). It is also stressed by a longer duration (as an eighth note, rather than a sixteenth note). Similarly, the “mon” of “c’mon” (m. 8, beat 2) is heavily accented by a higher pitch, at four semitones above the previous measure, and by volume, almost 3 dB louder. This accent seems unusual, since it does not rhyme like all of the preceding syllables on beat 2. Organized in groupings of 3 beats, 2 beats, and 3 beats, most of Fabolous’s major accents (except for end-rhymes) are on the downbeats, which correspond to the onsets of chords on the track.

In a 3+5 grouping, he raps the clause, “We gon’ be alright,” by always starting on the downbeat, making the clause fill a 3-beat measure. On the 5-beat measure, he takes up the final two beats with a repeat of “We gon’, we gon’” in the first instance and with silence in the second. Hence, Fabolous’s bridge fits perfectly into a 3+5 scheme. It would also fit well into a 3+2+3 scheme; in that case, the second “right” would fall on the downbeat of a 3-beat measure, with “we gon’, we gon’” taking up the last two beats of the measure. Such a scheme would make the chordal onsets in the accompaniment fit with the downbeats. Combined with the pre-hook, Fabolous’s interpretation of “Awwright” seems less ambiguous and more rooted in the 3+5 or 3+2+3 grouping. As I will show later, the intonation of his delivery sounds more certain, too. Meter in Lamar and Williams’s “Alright” Example 9 .

The rhyme, “highlight,” completes both the sentence and the measure on beat 3. The following 5-beat measure contains the entire sentence that ends the loop. In a 4 4 scheme, the “Pain” in “Painkillers” would have landed on the relatively weak beat 4, which matches neither the accent pattern of the word nor the pitch-and-volume accent Lamar gives to that syllable.

Example 13a shows Lamar’s durations in sixteenth notes, on the downbeat of a 3+2+3-beat scheme, expressed in a ratio of the downbeat’s duration relative to the syllables before and after it. (36) The downbeat syllables in a 3+2+3 pattern generally have a longer duration than preceding syllables, at an eighth or quarter note versus the sixteenth-note patterns that precede most of them. For example, four sixteenth notes (“looking at the”) act as an upbeat to the eighth-note on “world,” giving it a duration-based accent; “world” would be on beat 4 of a 4 4 measure but is beat 1 in a 3+2+3 grouping. Similar patterns accent other beat-4s repositioned as beat-1s: sixteenth notes on “wanna kill us” lead to the eighth-note “dead,” while sixteenth-notes on “gettin’” lead to the eighth-note “weak.” Lamar pronounces the words on the downbeats in the 3+2+3 grouping at a volume 2–5 dB louder than the preceding syllable, well over the just-noticeable threshold of 0.5 dB at 80 dB ( Example 13b ). In particular, he enunciates what would normally be the weak beat 4 of a 4 4 scheme at an average of 3.6 dB louder than the preceding syllable. The 3+2+3 downbeats are also marked by pitch relative to the preceding and succeeding syllables. Example 13c shows the ratio of the frequency of the 3+2+3 downbeat against those of the preceding and succeeding syllables. Usually the downbeat pitches are higher by a semitone or more, making the difference perceptible. (37) Some end-rhymes (which would be on beat 2 in a 4 4 setting) are pitched lower by a semitone or more (e.g., the “go” on “Where do we GO,” and “sho’” on “for SHO’”), which lends them a sense of weight, stressing them in a gentler fashion. (38) Hence, Lamar accents words in a 3-beat, 2-beat, 3-beat grouping by a combination of duration, volume, and pitch. This mixture of a 3+2+3 rhythmic flow with a 4 4 rhyme placement adds to the sense of ambiguity. Example 13a .

Fabolous’s and Pharrell Williams’s hooks differ in intonation and inflection, lending several possibilities for the interpretation of Williams’s hook. Falling intonation is generally associated with statements, reinforcement, conduciveness, and finality, while rising intonation is often thought to signal questions, reservations, openness to disagreements, and a continuing conversation—that is, uncertainty ( Cruttenden 1981 ; Warren 2016 ). Rising-tone endings can be associated with lack of confidence, powerlessness, and tentativeness. They are more often associated with women, which Robin Lakoff ( 2004 ) interpreted as indicating feelings of “inferiority” (78), “real powerlessness or a desire not to appear assertive” (109). Linguistic studies actually paint a more complex picture in light of social context, in which people in positions of power also use rising tones (e.g., George W. Bush; see Liberman 2005 ). While linked with deference, rising tones may also signal social openness: the speaker is checking to make sure the listener understands or is in agreement; he or she is prompting the audience to respond; and he or she may be asking, “Are you with me emotionally?” The impression is that there is a continuing conversation rather than a final declaration. In this way, the rising-tone statement reinforces in-group solidarity in some communities, be it Frank Zappa’s valley girls or informal African American groups ( Warren 2016 , chapters 3 and 4).",

(39) Tarone ( 1973 ) noted the role of street culture in the development of African American speech. In her comparison of informal black English, informal white English, and formal black English in Seattle, she found that black English used a wider pitch range than white English. (40) In particular, African Americans displayed a greater tendency to use higher pitches, often shifting into falsetto for dramatic tension (33). Black English also had more rising final pitch contours. She noted the importance of social contexts in intonation, pointing out that rising intonation implied that the speaker expected a response, like the call-and-response patterns of rappers and audiences or an African American church service (33). Conversely, she believed that African Americans asked yes/no questions in a falling contour in formal or potentially threatening situations, whereas they used rising contours in familiar ones. While there is no consensus on the interpretations of African American intonation, Tarone’s findings of wider pitch ranges and rising intonation in sentences among African Americans have been corroborated by Hudson and Holbrook ( 1981 , 1982 ), Jun and Foreman ( 1996 ), Loman ( 1975 ), and Goodwin et al. ( 2002 ), among others ( Thomas 2015 ). A further complicating factor is that Williams grew up in Virginia Beach in a family from Virginia and North Carolina—a region noted for sing-song speech.

Pharrell Williams is such a speaker. A pop-culture omnivore with a taste for Nirvana as well as 1970s Soul Train , Williams is a self-proclaimed nerd (with a rap group named N.E.R.D.) who went to a magnet school for the gifted and graduated from one of the highest-ranked public high schools in Virginia (US News and World Report 2018); his mother was an educator with a doctoral degree ( Kirk 2014 ).  In formal interviews, his vocal contour falls more often than not, as in his 100-minute interview with African Canadian journalist Jason King at New York University ( Williams P 2015 ). Nonetheless, his intonation can vary: in an interview with white journalists from CBS, Williams speaks mostly in declarative, falling-tone sentences; however, toward the end of the interview, he responds to the only female journalist in the group in mostly flat or rising-tone sentences ( CBS 2014 ). These speech samples show that Williams uses a variety of intonational speech patterns and responds (consciously or subconsciously) to their semantic and social implications in different speech contexts.

Fabolous’s intonation falls five times out of eight iterations; the only time that his intonation rises is in the fifth measure of the hook (at the repetition of the phrase), when the harmony rises to A ♭ m11; perhaps the rapper’s intonation is responding to this rise in pitch in the track. (42) In contrast, Pharrell’s pitch rises four times out of the eight iterations; the only times his cadence falls are in the shortened iteration of “We gon’ be alright,” just preceding the faster sixteenth notes of “Do you hear me, do you feel me” that build up into the repeat of the phrase and the final cadence. Both rappers’ pitches step down at the final cadence to the hook. Table 6 . “Alright,” pitches of “al-“ and “right” in hook (1:29) (click to enlarge)",

Several aspects make it sound unambiguously affirmative. First, the pitch of the sentence overall has a falling trend, which is associated with assertiveness and certainty. Furthermore, on “right,” there is a fall in pitch after the attack, making it sound affirmative. Most importantly, he keeps the volume high until the end of the syllable (as illustrated by the green line for dB, which only falls off after the pitch (in blue) has begun to fall (ca. 22). The result is an impression of utter confidence, which seems appropriate to the unapologetic and confident nature of his lyrics. Fabolous luxuriates in his wealth and women, and notes that his wealth has caused jealousy among some of his friends. Unlike Lamar, he reveals no conflicting feelings and doesn’t think he owes anyone. Example 15 . Fabolous, hook, first two iterations (click to watch) Example 16 .

When his pitch does fall, it falls for a shorter time than Fabolous’s. As a result, this affirmative gesture is less audible on Williams’s version than on Fabolous’s. Furthermore, unlike Fabolous’s constantly strong volume, Williams drops his volume about halfway through the syllable “right”; the pitch of this last word is heard continuing to rise at a lower volume.

Fabolous’s interpretation at the corresponding point ( Example 18 ), with its flat or falling pitches and sustained volumes, do not give off this feeling of uncertainty.

The ambiguity is made even greater by the fact that in African American speech, questions can have the same word order as sentences, without the inversion of the subject and auxiliary verb ( Rickford 1999 , 5). Could Williams have been posing a question, asking if we would really be alright? Was he betraying a feeling of uncertainty, repeating the phrase as if to reassure his audience against the odds? Or was he indeed making a statement? If so, was he speaking to his in-group, and if so, which one? Was he calling out for audience members, listeners, or the people at large to respond? Was he inviting them to join together in communion or prayer, in keeping with the gospel-like choir on the track? Was Williams expressing doubt or encouraging a continuing conversation? Any of these interpretations would seem plausible, according to the findings by linguists as outlined earlier. Given the many ways that vocal intonations could be interpreted, Williams’s delivery of the famous hook carries a plethora of potential meanings that conflict with one another. And given Williams’s hesitancy, at the time, to declare his political stances—he said during his interview with Jason King that he was “not an activist”—perhaps he intended this ambiguity.",

In the second iteration when the downbeat falls on “be” instead of “right,” it feels unstable, because “be” is not a primary accent in this clause; it lasts only a sixteenth note. Yet Williams continues to repeat the five-syllable phrase in a 4 4 grouping, regardless of whether the most accented syllables are placed on a downbeat or not ( Example 19b ). The loop continues, and in the next iteration, what felt unstable becomes stabilized as the “right” falls on a downbeat (of a 3+5 or 3+2+3 scheme) again. We are alternately off-kilter, then grounded again. The loop is like the cycles of life, in which we overcome difficulties, or things eventually revert to a more comfortable state. Williams repeats the pattern so often that we become entrained; we accept it. If one repeats something enough times, one comes to believe it.  We embrace the uncertainty to believe in the message.

It has since become more generalized, according to Rick Rubin, as “our generation’s protest song” ( Gwizdowski 2016 ). It has featured in protests against Donald Trump. On March 11, 2016, protesters conducted a sit-in at a planned rally for Trump at the University of Illinois-Chicago; when the announcer said that the candidate was canceling his appearance, the protesters erupted into a chant of “Alright” ( Bramesco 2016 ). It was also heard in post-election protests, including one in Chicago in front of Trump Tower on November 10, 2016 ( Chicago Reporter 2016 ), and an inauguration-day protest in Chicago on January 20, 2017 ( Block Club Chicago 2017 ).

In the absence of any other stimuli, we are prone to perceiving “we” as beat 1 because of the strong-beat-early rule (MPR 2 in Lerdahl and Jackendoff, grouping rule MPR 4 T in Temperley); this placement also matches the bridge on Fabolous’s version. But this perception of “we” as beat 1 is also made clear by the call-and-response patterns that often accompany these chants. Sometimes individuals are interjecting phrases like “yeah” or “whoo” spontaneously, as in the Cleveland protest, while at the Million March and #TheRealUW, there is an appointed agitator who is encouraging the protesters along by supplying responses (“I can’t hear you”). This call-and-response pattern is characteristic of many folk and popular musics, including African diasporic genres. It is also common in protest chants.
