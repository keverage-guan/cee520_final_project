    "abstract": "Building on the work of Stephen Soderberg, Julian Hook, Robert Morris, and others, this article explores a wide variety of voice-leading transformations involving set types 4-27[0258], 4-18[0147], 4-13[0136], and 4-12[0236]. It considers tetrachordal connections between any two members of the same set class and all twenty-four ways to voice-lead each tetrachordal connection. The paper organizes these many possibilities and suggests compositional applications. It shows various ways to maintain control over the content of individual voices by constructing voice-leading spaces that involve a limited number of voice-leading transformations and rules for concatenating the transformations.",

This particular choice of sm and conventional ordering highlights consistencies from one tetrachordal space to another because the diminished triad always involves sm 1–3 and the “warped pc” sm 4. It would have been possible to take sm from the familiar set-class prime forms—and I tried this in my first drafts of this work—but such a system conceals inter-space consistency because of the varying placement of the diminished triad. That is, the diminished triad appears as the second, third and fourth digits in [0258] and [0147] but as the first, third and fourth in [0136] and [0236], and it does not help that the diminished triad variously appears as “036,” “147” and “258.”",

As examples, C 7 –C 7 , C 7 – C ♯ 7 , and C 7 –E articulate Hook’s W 0 , W 1 , and W 4 , respectively, and my MORRIS+ 1 W 4 , W 3 , and W 0 , respectively.",

First, some oci appear in multiple MORRIS w spaces and we need a way to distinguish these situations from one another. For example oci 9003 is part of four different VL: MORRIS 1 S 3 9003, MORRIS 2 S 3 9003, MORRIS 4 S 3 9003 and MORRIS 5 S 3 9003. Second, some oci satisfy the harmonic requirements of only one of the four tetrachord types and there is usually no way quick way to determine this (other than trial and error). For example, when applied to a member of 4-13[0136], oci 8259 produces another member of the same set class, but applied to any other MORRIS+ w set type oci 8259 produces a second chord that is of a different set type and therefore not within the scope of this paper.",

Although the notational conventions of my VL and Lewin’s 1998 “a voice leading from X into Y” (e.g. {A → G ♯ , D → E, F → E}) are somewhat different, the concepts share much in common. Both identify—either explicitly or implicitly—the chord/set members of X and Y involved in each voice and the melodic intervals they form. The primary difference is that all of my VL are one-to-one and onto whereas some of Lewin’s voice leadings are not. For an approach that defines voice leading by explicitly listing, within each voice, the set member of X, the set member of Y, and the melodic interval, consult Cope 2002 , 125.",

A more detailed explanation of inverses: For each ci at matrix position (j, k) within a given wechsel VL, the inverse VL includes the same ci at matrix position (k, j), which ensures that, if the VL are juxtaposed, both instances of the ci appear in the same voice. Since wechsel transformations alternate prime and inverted orientations, consecutive instances of the same ci in a given voice result in an overall ci 0. For example, ci 8 appears at (1, 2) in W 5 8259 but at (2, 1) in W 5 5829, which means that, in the example, the soprano voice moves by ci 8 from sm 1 (pc 0) of the first chord to sm 2 (pc 8) of the next chord and then by ci 8 back to sm 1 (pc 0) of the third chord.

Soderberg divides the constellation, called MORRIS (or T-HEX), into four overlapping eight-hexachord sub-constellations based on tetrachordal subset content. The first of these sub-constellations, TRISTAN, includes the hexachords that embed two instances of set class 4-27[0258], the set class of the major-minor and half-diminished seventh chords. Similarly, constellations ZAUBER, AGITATION, and BROODING include the hexachords that embed two instances of set classes 4-18[0147], 4-13[0136], and 4-12[0236], respectively. Soderberg characterizes each of these tetrachordal set types as a “warp” of the diminished seventh chord. When the “warp index,” w , is 1, the result is set class 4-27—that is, moving any pc of a diminished seventh chord by interval class (ic) 1 creates a member of set class 4-27. Similarly, setting w = 2, 4, and 5 creates set classes 4-18, 4-13, and 4-12, respectively. The article goes on to point out a general property of voice leading: in each hexachord the pair of tetrachords can be connected by holding two pitch classes in common and by moving two others by ±w. The cases involving 4-27 and ic 1 voice leading (TRISTAN) are familiar— ii –V 7 , the Tristan chord with resolution, A ♯ 7 – B ♭ 7 at the beginning of Debussy’s Faune , and others—and have been addressed in the theoretic literature by several authors.

(For each value of w there are nine transformations but only eight hexachord types because two of the transformations yield the same hexachord type.) The article then greatly expands the scope of inquiry, not only by allowing a given tetrachord to connect to any member of the same set class, but also by considering all twenty-four ways to voice-lead each of these twenty-four tetrachordal connections. As a result, each of these much larger voice-leading spaces— MORRIS+ 1 , MORRIS+ 2 , MORRIS+ 4 , and MORRIS+ 5 —contains 576 (= 24 × 24) voice-leading transformations.

Although the number of potential voice-leading spaces is infinite, (2) my reasons for creating the ones I do are simple—to exercise melodic control over intervallic characteristics of the voices and to exercise harmonic control, not only of the individual tetrachords, but over the total pc content of sets of adjacent tetrachords. For example, in one space defined below a set of six MORRIS 5 voice-leading transformations can be concatenated in any order but remain within a single octatonic collection, in another space four MORRIS+ 4 transformations are strung together so that one voice descends chromatically while the other voices also move stepwise, and in a third example ten MORRIS+ 2 transformations are arranged so that each voice is saturated with a different interval class.

Third, branching out from the research on parsimonious voice leading—which focuses on stepwise melodic motion and tends to emphasize situations where moving voices articulate the same melodic interval class—this paper embraces both stepwise and non-stepwise voice leading and includes cases where voices move by the same or by different interval classes.

S 0 , the identity transformation, transforms any set onto itself. Concerning wechsel transformations, when W n transforms a set in prime orientation into an inverted one the embedded diminished triads articulate T n , but when it transforms an inverted set into a prime one the embedded diminished triads articulate T −n . For example, W 1 transforms {0, 3, 6, 1} into {7, 4, 1, 6}, within which {0, 3, 6} and {1, 4, 7} articulate T 1 ; W 1 transforms {6, 3, 0, 5} into {B, 2, 5, 0}, in which {0, 3, 6} and {B, 2, 5} articulate T B . It would have been possible to define the W subscripts by chronicling the movement of any referential pc within the tetrachords. The use of the diminished triad strikes me as best because it allows a single rule for all four set types and has other advantages. For instance, it engages Straus’s 1997 notion of “near-transposition” (*T n ); that is, each W n articulates *T n when applied to a prime set and *T −n when applied to an inverted set because it moves all but one of the set’s pcs by the same pc interval.

The first two types are familiar: given a voice in which pc x in tetrachordal set X is followed by pc y in tetrachordal set Y, the pc interval from pc x to pc y is y−x mod 12 and the interval class (ic) between pcs x and y is |y−x| mod 12. (Henceforth all arithmetic is considered to be mod 12 unless otherwise noted.) For example, the pc interval from 2 to 5 is 3, from 7 to 4 is 9, and from 1 to B is A, and the interval class between 2 and 5 is 3, between 7 and 4 is 3, and between 1 and B is 2. Like the subscripts of the S n and W n transformations, the third type of interval depends on the (prime or inverted) orientation of the initial set. If set X is in prime orientation the contextual interval (ci) from x to y is y−x (the same as \nthe pc interval), but if X is in inverted orientation then the contextual interval from x to y is x−y (the inverse of the pc interval). For example, if pc 2 occurs within a set in prime orientation, such as {0, 3, 6, 2}, then the ci from pc 2 to pc 5 is 3; but if pc 2 appears within a set in inverted orientation, such as {2, B, 8, 0}, then the ci from pc 2 to pc 5 is 9.

Therefore, there are twenty-four ways to voice-lead each S n /W n transformation. The paper identifies each of these possibilities using ordered lists of contextual intervals ( oci ). For example, oci 8259 indicates that sm 1 of X moves by ci 8, that sm 2 of X moves by ci 2, that sm 3 of X moves by ci 5, and that sm 4 of X moves by ci 9. A voice-leading transformation , hereafter VL, can be minimally defined by tetrachord type and oci. (12) For example, 4-13[0136] and oci 8259 define a VL that can be articulated by the set of voices {0–8, 3–5, 6–B, 1–A}. That is, sm 1 of X is pc 0, which moves by ci 8 to pc 8, sm 2 of X is 3, which moves by ci 2 to pc 5, sm 3 of X is 6, which moves by ci 5 to pc B, and sm 4 of X is 1, which moves by ci 9 to pc A. Throughout the paper, we will indicate tetrachord type with a voice-leading space (such as MORRIS+ 4 for 4-13) and include the pcset transformation that the VL articulates, creating VL labels such as MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259. (13) Example 3a provides three realizations of this VL. The first two use the set of voices {0–8, 3–5, 6–B, 1–A} and the third {5–9, 2–0, B–6, 4–7}, which begins with a chord in inverted orientation.

The unordered list of contextual intervals ( uci ) uses superscripts to count the number of times each ci appears within a VL; for instance MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259 articulates uci 2 1 5 1 8 1 9 1 . The unordered list of interval classes ( uic ) converts ci to ic; for example MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259 yields uic 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 . On a larger level, these uci and uic organize into types based on their superscripts. There are five uci types: x 4 , x 3 y 1 , x 2 y 2 , x 2 y 1 z 1 , x 1 y 1 z 1 q 1 , where x, y, z, and q are different ci. For example, uci 2 1 5 1 8 1 9 1 (and all others with one instance of four different ci) are of the type x 1 y 1 z 1 q 1 . There are also five uic types: |x| 4 , |x| 3 |y| 1 , |x| 2 |y| 2 , |x| 2 |y| 1 |z| 1 , |x| 1 |y| 1 |z| 1 |q| 1 , where |x|, |y|, |z|, and |q| are different ic. For instance, uic 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 and all others with one instance each of four different ic are of the type |x| 1 |y| 1 |z| 1 |q| 1 . Concerning the relation of a VL’s uci and uic, when all ci in a uci articulate different ics (e.g. uci type x 1 y 1 z 1 q 1 where x ≠ −y, x ≠ −z, x ≠ −q, y ≠ −z, y ≠ −q and z ≠ −q) the relation between uci type and uic type is straightforward, as in the case of uci 2 1 5 1 8 1 9 1 and uic 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 . But when different ci articulate the same ic (e.g. x = −q), then the uci and uic superscripts will differ. For example, MORRIS+ 4 W 5 824A articulates uci 2 1 4 1 8 1 A 1 but uic 2 2 4 2 .

Set X appears to the left of the matrix in conventional ordering and set Y appears above the matrix in conventional ordering. Matrix rows are labeled 1–4 from top to bottom to correspond to the set members of X, and columns are labeled 1–4 from left to right to correspond to the sm of Y. Matrix position (j, k) contains the contextual interval from sm j of X to sm k of Y. A one-to-one and onto mapping of X onto Y involves four matrix positions that include each matrix row and column precisely once. As an example, consider the matrix for MORRIS+ 4 W 5 , where X = {0, 3, 6, 1} and Y = {B, 8, 5, A}, given as Example 3b . The boldface and underlined ci within the matrix point out VL MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259—ci 8, 2, 5, 9 at matrix positions (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), and (4, 4), respectively. (15) Notice that the notation MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259 does not explicitly indicate the various sm of Y, but that viewing the VL in its matrix context does make them explicit—the sm of Y are the column numbers in the matrix positions. For example, ci 8 at matrix position (1, 2) means that sm 1 of X moves to sm 2 of Y via ci 8, ci 2 at matrix position (2, 3) means that sm 2 of X moves to sm 3 of Y , and so forth. Later in the paper, when the sm of Y is not vital to the discussion I use the compact notation (e.g. MORRIS+ 4 W 5 8259), but when the goal sm is vital—as in Part V when it comes time to control the intervallic content of a single voice in a lengthy chain of VL—I list ci along with their matrix position (e.g. ci 8 @ (1, 2), etc.).

Example 4 features four lattices that facilitate deriving the MORRIS w VL—the nine ways to transform each MORRIS w tetrachord into another member of the same set class by holding two pitch classes in common and by moving each of the other two pitch classes by interval class w . Each lattice has < w >-cycle rows and <3>-cycle columns. Within each lattice, each row represents a voice, so that voice leading by ci w is modeled by horizontal movement to the right to an adjacent pc within a row and voice leading by ci − w by movement to the left. Vertical pc moves are forbidden. Having one pc in each row creates a tetrachord, which is a member of the MORRIS w tetrachordal set class if and only if three pcs are in one column and one pc is in an adjacent column. Taking MORRIS 5 as an example, starting with {0, 3, 6, 2}, there are twenty-four possible ways to move two voices by ic 5—six possible pairs of moving voices and two possible directions for each moving voice—but only nine of these create another 4-12. Since pc 2 is in a column by itself it is helpful to organize these nine possibilities around what pc 2 does. First, if pc 2 leads to pc 7 a dead end is reached because pc 7 would be two columns away from the other pcs and with only one move remaining it is impossible to move all three remaining voices to an adjacent column. If pc 2 leads to the left, to pc 9, there are six other single moves that generate another 4-12. Three of these involve moves to the right (0–5, 3–8, and 6–B) and the other three involve moves to the left (0–7, 3–A, and 6–1). Third and finally, if pc 2 does not move, then two of the other voices need to be led to the right to generate another 4-12. There are three ways to do this (0–5 with 3–8, 0–5 with 6–B, and 3–8 with 6–B). Overall, there are three cases where both moving voices articulate ci 5 (move to the right) and so the uci is 0 2 5 2 , three cases where both moving voices articulate ci 7 (move to the left) and so the uci is 0 2 7 2 , and three cases where one moving voice articulates ci 5 and the other ci 7 resulting in uci 0 2 5 1 7 1 .

In similar fashion the path returns to D 7 via the two chords that have not yet been included. All in all, there are ten possible paths, given in Example 7b . Two paths contain only wechsel VL and eight paths contain a mixture of wechsel and schritt VL. Example 7c realizes two of these paths in staff notation. In each case the held pc 2 appears in the bass voice and the pc-0 voice in the soprano.",

For example, consider series of MORRIS 2 VL that embrace all twelve pcs as quickly as possible, that is, four pcs in the first chord and two new pcs in each of the next four. Put another way, each series uses each pc exactly once—a pc may be held from one chord to the next but once left it is not reiterated. Fulfilling these conditions is only possible when all four voices move in the same direction and so schritt VL, which involve contrary motion, are forbidden. (20) Since a series of wechsel VL creates an alternation between sets in prime orientation and those in inverted orientation, there must also be an alternation of contextual intervals 2 and A in order to keep the voices moving by the same pc interval. This means that if the first transformation is W 3 , W 6 , or W 9 , which articulate uci 0 2 A 2 , then the next transformation must be W 5 , W 8 , or W B , which articulate uci 0 2 2 2 . For example, transforming {0, 3, 6, B}, a set in prime orientation, by W 3 creates motion by pc interval A (0–A and B–9), which leads to {A, 3, 6, 9}, a set in inverted orientation. To continue motion by pc interval A, we need to choose W 5 , W 8 , or W B ; choosing W B , for instance, creates moving voices 6–4 and 9–7, which lead to {A, 3, 4, 7}.

First, S w and S − w , the only schritt transformations with octachordal total pc content, generate the complement of the MORRIS+ |2 w | tetrachord. When w = 1 or 5, |2 w | = 2, which means that MORRIS 1 ’s S 1 and S B and MORRIS+ 5 ’s S 5 and S 7 each create 8-18[01235689], the complement of MORRIS+ 2 ’s 4-18. Similarly, when w = 2 or 4, |2 w | = 4, so that MORRIS+ 2 ’s S 2 and S A and MORRIS+ 4 ’s S 4 and S 8 generate 8-13[01234679], the complement of the MORRIS+ 4 ’s 4-13. The latter case is special because pairs of 4-13 \ntetrachords are generating their own complement. Second, for w = 1, 2, and 5—but not 4 because of the special case just mentioned— S 2 w and S –2 w generate the same total septachordal pc content as W 2 w . For example, MORRIS 1 ’s S 2 , S A , and W 2 each generate 7-34[013468A]. All in all, it will be helpful to divide the twenty-four transformations within each MORRIS+ w into six groups as follows: The S 0 -group includes S 0 , S 3 , S 6 , and S 9 ; the S w -group includes S w , S 3+ w , S 6+ w , S 9+ w ; and the S − w -group includes S − w , S –3− w , S –6− w , and S –9− w .

Example 12a provides generalized matrices in terms of n and w (for w = 1, 2, 4, or 5), one for S n and one for W n , which allow general properties of the matrices and resulting VL to emerge. For example, each S n matrix features ten different ci, four that appear multiple times and six others that appear only once. Each W n matrix features eight different ci, one that appears once, one that appears three times, and six others that appear twice each. Each W n matrix is symmetrical around the main diagonal. Many consistent patterns may be drawn from the matrices but I will mention only three. First, in every W n matrix there are four sets of matrix positions that yield an oci with two instances each of two different ci (uci type x 2 y 2 ). For instance, with the matrix for MORRIS+ w W n the set of positions {(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2)} yields oci xyxy, with uci x 2 y 2 where x = 6+n and y = 6+n− w . (25) Second, the upper-left 3 × 3 square of a W n matrix depends on n but not w , which means that all four W 1 matrices have an identical upper-left 3 × 3 square. Third, transformations in the same group feature the same set of ci in these w -independent matrix positions, a set equal to their subscripts taken as a set. For example, the W 0 -groups have ci 0, 3, 6, and 9 in their upper-left 3 × 3 squares. These features can be verified by consulting Example 12b , which lists all ninety-six matrices.",

Such models are easy to generate because any two voices saturated with ic 2 that do not form harmonic ic 4 (the ic that 4-13 does not contain) can participate in multiple statements of these VL. (27) This model demonstrates variety in several respects. It incorporates all six MORRIS+ 4 VL with uic 2 4 (S 2 2222, S A AAAA, W 5 A22A, W 8 2A2A, W A AAA2, and W B 22AA) and mixes prime and inverted sets in various ways. At times it unfolds the same VL in both layers simultaneously while at other times the VL differ. The voice leading from one chord to the next usually mixes pc intervals 2 and A, but the third and fourth chords articulate inverse-related VL, S 2 2222 and S A AAAA, which, since they are applied to sets of contrasting orientation, create pc interval 2 in all voices. Moreover, the seven chords articulate six different set types; each of the first six chords articulates a MORRIS-constellation hexachord because it is comprised of two 4-13s that share two pcs, and the final chord has only four pcs—the same 4-13 in both layers. Example 13e provides a musical realization based on the model: the middle two voices of the model appear in the cello part, a mixture of double stops and compound melody, and the other model voices appear in the piano part, all in the treble register.

For example, MORRIS+ 5 W 3 9395* can be realized by the set of voices {0–9, 3–6, 6–3, 2–7}, in which 3–6 and 6–3 articulate a voice exchange. Accounting for the remaining thirty-two VL, each transformation within the W 2 w group of MORRIS+ 1 and MORRIS+ 5 articulates four VL with uic |x| 3 |y| 1 . For instance, MORRIS+ 5 W A includes AA82, 2A42, 2AA8, and 4A88; the first three articulate uic 2 3 4 1 —forming a Z-triple —and the last one uic 4 3 2 1 . Example 14a provides a complete list of VL with uic type |x| 3 |y| 1 and 14b realizes the S 1 and MORRIS+ 5 W A VL in musical notation.",

Although each combination results in the same pair of octachordal pcsets and the same melodic motion within each register, there is considerable variety because each combination creates a different pair of parallel dyads within each register, as with the soprano’s {B5, G6}–{ A ♯ 5, F ♯ 6}, {B5, B ♭ 6}–{ A ♯ 5, A6}, {C7, G7}–{B6, F ♯ 7}, and {C6, B ♭ 6}–{B5, A6}, which articulate harmonic ics 4, 1, 5, and 2, respectively.

                "text": "[49] The discussion of uic type |x| 2 |y| 2 concludes by pointing out a few such VL within an excerpt from Bartok’s String Quartet No. 6. The excerpt in Example 16 is the opening of the piece, in which the outer voices present overlapping statements of the opening 3½-measure melody (bracketed on the score) and then diverging sequences based on fragments of that melody. The inner voices are also primarily stepwise, moving first in free counterpoint and then in parallel tritones. Harmonically, the excerpt features five triadic anchor points, nineteen instances of the MORRIS tetrachords, and a variety of other sonorities. The MORRIS tetrachords create six VL of uic type |x| 2 |y| 2 : two from MORRIS 1 (W 9 00BB and W 7 1010), one from MORRIS 2 (S 3 200A), a side-by-side pair from MORRIS+ 4 (S B 5B5B and W A A0A0), and one from MORRIS+ 5 (S 0 6B61**). Two of these VL articulate uic 0 2 1 2 , two uic 0 2 2 2 and the others 1 2 5 2 and 1 2 6 2 . Four involve ic 0, which is not surprising given the frequency with which two voices hold while two others move, and all six involve either ic 1 or ic 2, which makes sense given the stepwise thematic material. In all but two cases “passing sonorities” complicate the musical realizations. The rhythmic offset of the moving voices of MORRIS 2 S 3 200A creates an intervening 4-17[0347], parallel tritones moving by half step decorate W 7 1010 with a pair of 4-16s [0157], and further stepwise motion during MORRIS+ 4 S B 5B5B and MORRIS+ 5 S 0 6B61** creates embellishing 4–5 [0126] and 4–6 [0127] sonorities. Moreover, each VL features precisely two voices moving stepwise (either by ic 1 or ic 2), which creates contrast with the approaches to the F ♯ m, GM, E ♭ M and Cm triadic anchors, each of which involves stepwise motion in all four voices . (The approaches to F ♯ m and GM mix half- and whole-step voice leading and the approaches to E ♭ M and Cm feature all four voices moving by half step.) Finally, taken as a group, the roots of all five triadic anchors (A, F ♯ , G, E ♭ , C) articulate 5-31 [01369], the sole pentachordal set type that embeds all four of the MORRIS tetrachords.",

Example 17c realizes these in staff notation so that ic 0 always appears in the soprano voice, ic 2 in the alto, ic 3 in the tenor, and ic 5 in the bass. Example 17d constructs a short excerpt for string quartet that incorporates three 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 VL. The passage’s six 4-13 chords articulate S 9 0732– (S 9 3669)– W 0 0295– (W 7 777B)– S 0 0372. For each 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 VL, ic 0 appears in violin I, ic 2 in violin II, ic 3 in viola, and ic 5 in the cello. Since every second VL is part of 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 , each pc in the passage participates in a statement of its instrument’s primary ic; for instance, violin II’s D ♭ – E ♭ , A–B, and C–D state ic 2. The parenthesized VL, which do not articulate uic 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 , arise as a result of the consistent ic/instrument pairing within the 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 VL. Three other features of the passage bear mentioning. First, the 0 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 VL involve more shared pcs as the passage progresses; that is, at S 9 0732 the 4-13s share two pcs, at W 0 0295 three, and at S 0 0372 all four. This is reflected by gradual decreases in dynamic level, rhythmic activity, and register. Second, all 4-13s but the fourth are in prime orientation; these articulate S 9 – S 9 – S 5 – S 0 , which is a large-scale projection of 4-13. Finally, the staggered pc entrances within each 4-13 are calculated to reinforce pitch/rhythmic relationships; that is, each ic 2 in violin II articulates an attack-point duration of 2 (taking the eighth note as the unit), each ic 3 in the viola duration 3, and each ic 5 in the cello duration 4. The simultaneous arrival of the pcs in the final chord strengthens the sense of cadence.",

The result is a pair of voices saturated with ci-succession 3–5–2–A (soprano imitated two beats later at T 4 by alto), another voice that alternates ci 7 and 9 (bass), and another that repeats ci 8 (tenor). Overall, these sequential patterns create voices that articulate symmetrical pc collections: the augmented triad (3-12[048]), the whole-tone, hexatonic, and enneatonic collections (6-35 [02468A], 6-20[014589], 9-12[01245689A]), and 6-30[013679], which is invariant under T 6 .",

                "text": "[57] There are a few notable differences when wechsel transformations are involved. First, by definition, the juxtaposition of a VL with its inverse creates an overall S 0 0000, a simple neighbor-like return to the original chord as illustrated by MORRIS+ 1 W B 28B9 and B289 in Examples 18d and 18e . Second, consecutive statements of a single W n create an oscillation between two chords, as with Example 18f ’s series of W B 28B9, which alternates D 7 and A 7 . Highlighting chordal identity, the musical realization places all four voices in the same register so that each D 7 features the same set of pitches as does each A 7 . Third, any series of wechsel transformations causes an alternation between prime and inverted orientations of the chords, which means that if a voice is saturated with a single ci there is an alternation of inversionally-related pc intervals and therefore an oscillation between two pcs. For example, the series of W B 28B9 in Example 18f creates a soprano line saturated with ci 9, which causes an alternation between pc intervals 9 and 3 articulated by C–A–C–A– . . . Indeed, any repeating pattern involving an odd number of ci creates abutting inversionally-related segments. For instance, Example 18f’s bass voice features ci succession 2–8–1 twice, once articulated by D–E– A ♭ –G (pc intervals 2–4–B) and once by G–F– C ♯ –D (pc intervals A–8–1). Fourth, rotationally-related voices in these wechsel series are related to one another by rotation and T 0 , as with the tenor and alto voices which imitate the bass at T 0 , two and four chords later, respectively. Finally, Z-triples and quadruples can be used to generate interesting examples such as 18f (and avoid brief neighbor-like figures such as 18d and 18e) as long as inverse VL are not placed side-by-side. For instance, one could arrange the VL in the Z-triple MORRIS+ 5 W 1 11B5/511B/71BB into a recurring pattern in which statements of 71BB separate the inverses 11B5 and 511B from one another: 11B5–71BB–511B–71BB.

For instance, given the twenty MORRIS+ 2 VL within uic 1 1 2 1 4 1 5 1 , it is possible to concatenate VL so that each voice is limited to a single ic. Example 19a graphs all such connections. The graph is in two disjoint but congruent halves, dividing the twenty VL into two groups of ten. Single-direction arrows identify situations where one VL may follow another (e.g. W 1 15A8 may follow W 4 78AB) and double-direction arrows identify (inverse-related) VL that may precede or follow one another (e.g. W 1 15A8 and W 1 8A15). Twelve VL have precisely two VL that could precede it and two that could follow it, four others have two VL that could precede it but only one that could follow it, and the remaining four have only one VL that could precede it but two that could follow. Example 19b provides one path through the left half of the graph, along with a chart that shows that, for each ic, the matrix column value for one VL is the same as the row value for the next.

The graph is radically different in shape from the previous one: four VL are dead ends and four others are unapproachable beginnings (these eight appear in the center of the graph), and the remaining twelve each have two possible antecedents and two possible consequents that create a complex web with no double-direction arrows.

Since having twenty VL within the same uic and MORRIS+ w is a rare luxury, we study a situation with fewer possible VL, the set of eight MORRIS+ 4 schritt transformations that articulate uic 0 1 1 1 2 1 5 1 (S 1 7BA0, S B 0251, S 2 20B7, S 2 5021, S A A150, S A B7A0, S 5 B207, and S 7 A510). With these eight VL, even the seemingly modest goal of saturating a single voice with pc interval 5 reaches a dead end after, at most, three VL. One reasonable solution is to permit the featured voice to articulate pc interval 0, but only whenever continuation by pc interval 5 is impossible. The graph in Example 21a illustrates the possibilities for VL concatenation assuming the use of chords in prime orientation. Since the featured voice may contain side-by-side ci 5 but not side-by-side ci 0, it is necessary to track whether the featured voice is articulating ci 5 (e.g. S A A1 5 0) or ci 0 (e.g. S A A15 0 ). (32) Examples 21b–d provide musical realizations for three paths within the graph, focusing on S A A150 and S 7 A510 and avoiding dead-end nodes such as S 2 5 0 21. These series articulate overall S A AAAA, S 8 8888, and S 6 6666, respectively, which means that sequential repetition of each string of VL would eventually lead to an overall S 0 0000.

                "text": "[61] Of course if VL and featured pc interval are carefully chosen, it is possible to saturate a voice with one pc interval with only a few VL and without resorting to interspersed pc interval 0. For example, MORRIS+ 4 ’s W B B1B1, W 7 AA1B, and W 8 1B2A can be combined to create an infinitely long series of pc interval B in one voice—no matter the initial chord’s orientation or featured-voice sm. If the initial chord is in prime orientation ci B will create pc interval B; if sm 1 is in the featured voice then W B B 1B1 is needed, if sm 2 then W 8 1 B 2A, if sm 3 W B B1 B 1, and if sm 4 W 7 AA1 B . If the initial chord is in inverted orientation ci 1 will create pc interval B; if sm 1 is in the featured voice then W 8 1 B2A is needed, if sm 2 then W B B 1 B1, if sm 3 W 7 AA 1 B, and if sm 4 W B B1B 1 . Example 22a presents a graph showing how the string of pc B would be continued. The graph is somewhat strange because any starting point leads, sooner or later, to the same (potentially endless) circuit of four nodes. The ability to generate an infinite series of pc interval B with so few VL is a result of the multiple occurrences of ci 1/B within the VL and the freedom to choose VL with different uic. Added benefits include that W 7 AA1B and W 8 1B2A articulate the same uic (1 2 2 2 ), and that the three VL articulate only two different ics (1 and 2), which saturates the texture with stepwise motion. Example 22b provides a realization of one path through the graph, 22c shows the matrix position connections for the voice that articulates pc interval B, and 22d offers a straightforward musical realization of the model for string quartet.",

Example 23a lists the thirty-seven MORRIS+ 5 VL for which two voices that are ic 3 apart proceed by ci 0, 1, 2, A, or B. In all such VL the first two or middle two ci of the oci are the same (e.g. W 9 1195, W 0 400A, W 5 B227). These thirty-eight VL are divided into four boxes based on the matrix positions of the repeated ci: in the upper left box positions (1,2)/(2,1), in the upper right (2,3)/(3,2), in the lower left either (1,3)/(2,2) or (1,2)/(2,3), and lower right (2,2)/(3,1) or (2,1)/(3,2). The method of connection is the same as in previous examples, that is, to keep the parallel ic 3 within the same pair of voices the column values for one VL’s repeated ci must match the row values for the next. For example, the repeated ci of VL in the upper \nleft box appear in columns 1 and 2 and so they must be followed by VL whose repeated ci appear in rows 1 and 2, that is, by a VL from that same box or by one from the lower left box. Examples 23b–23e demonstrate a few possible ways to concatenate these VL. In 23b the upper voices ascend in parallel minor thirds by whole step and in 23c they descend by half step using only schritt transformations. In Example 23d, the lower voices oscillate between two major sixths, { E ♭ 3, C4} and {F3, D4}, in an unpredictable rhythm caused by VL featuring pc interval 0, while the upper voices explore the A major diatonic collection. In Example 23e, parallel minor thirds articulate a repeating pattern of pc intervals, 0–B–A–0–B–A–0.",

Such study suggests relating the MORRIS w tetrachords and resulting chord progressions to (extended) tonal practice. (34) Also, the VL machinery may be applied to other individual set types. Non-symmetrical tetrachords have the same number of VL (576) but symmetrical ones have fewer. Finally, it is possible to connect the MORRIS tetrachords to others, address sets of other cardinalities, and consider VL that are not one-to-one and onto. All of this, along with the potential analytic and compositional applications of these theoretic possibilities, makes it clear that (tetrachordal) voice leading includes an infinitely interesting set of options that we have only begun to explore.",
