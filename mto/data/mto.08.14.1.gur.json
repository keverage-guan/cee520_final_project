    "abstract": "Studies by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in the field of cognitive linguistics give rise to a theory of meaning that bestows a central role on metaphorical thinking and the body. This essay explores the ramifications of physical embodiment on Jean-Philippe Rameau’s conceptualization of tonal harmony. My examination will show that Johnson’s theory of the bodily basis of metaphor is not sufficiently adequate to account for all the aspects of Rameau’s harmonic theory, and additional sources for metaphorical projection should be taken into account for its full rendering.",

He criticizes the romantic aesthetics that take \nemotion to be an authority in matters of art and suggests that the unique beauty \nof music should be investigated using the methods of the natural sciences. In \nhis words, he aims “to get alongside the thing itself, seeking whatever among \nour thousandfold flickering impressions and feelings may be enduring and \nobjective.” (1) That being said, he goes on to assert that in music the stable and \nobjective factors are the “tonal moving forms” that are present in musical \ncomposition independent of the listener or observer who perceives them. To be \nsure, Hanslick does not deny the ability of music to arouse feelings but this \nability, in his opinion, has no relation to artistic value.

(5) Scruton says that the descriptive \nlanguage of listeners discloses the concepts and categories they apply while \nlistening to music. Accordingly, he distinguishes between two forms of \nunderstanding reflected in the difference between the description of material \n(or acoustic) characteristics of sound and musical description: scientific \nunderstanding, and a type of understanding that he calls, following the \nphenomenologists, “intentional understanding.” (6) Scientific understanding \napproaches the world as a material object and seeks to explain it in terms of \ncausal connections; intentional understanding, on the other hand, considers the \nworld as it appears to our direct awareness (in Husserl’s idiom, Lebenswelt ) and \nbrings to light only those connections and relations that are already implied in \none way or another by our concepts. “Because all our perception is informed by \nconcepts,” says Scruton, “and those concepts in their turn determine our \nunderstanding and practical reasoning, a critic or philosopher can bring system to an appearance, by drawing out the \nimplications of the concepts through which it is described. This description \nneed not be one that the person who perceives with understanding can provide. \nBut when he understands it, he will recognize it immediately as a description of \nthe experience that is his.” (7)",

This is reflected in the way \nwe hear, for instance, the change of a note in a phrase as “melodic motion”; \nwhen we perceive a note as being “low” or “high”; or when we interpret a \ncombination of individual notes as “harmony.” In all these cases, the object of \nthe description is not material fact but a phenomenal aspect of our musical \nexperience.

What appears in all the above mentioned cases, in which \nauditory events are understood in terms of musical categories, is metaphorical \ntransference, that is, taking concepts from one domain and applying them to \nanother. At the basis of our musical understanding, Scruton argues, lies a \ncomplex system of metaphor that causes us to hear tones (as opposed to sounds) \nas being in motion. Scruton rejects various suggestions according to which this \nmotion is in fact literal; (10) yet, he stresses that one cannot dispense with it. \nThe metaphor of space and motion within it is an integral part of the \nintentional object of our musical understanding and without it a true \ndescription of musical experience is not possible. (11) Therefore, he establishes, \nagainst the traditional formalistic view, that “any analysis of music must be an \nexercise in intentional rather than scientific understanding.” (12) His conclusion \nfinds empirical confirmation in the cognitive studies of Lakoff and Johnson who \nclaim in Metaphors We Live By ( 1980 ) that metaphor is the modus operandi of our \nthought as a whole. 3.

Consider for instance the \nexpression “I have no time,” suggesting that time is a material thing, or “your \nclaim is indefensible,” assuming that the claim is taking part in a battle. Such \nexpressions are so much a part of our daily speech that we tend to forget that \nthey are really metaphorical. But metaphor is not just a matter of words. From \nthe discovery of the frequency of metaphor in day-to-day language, Lakoff and Johnson go on to argue that metaphor structures and defines our conceptual \nsystem, and, as a result, also has an effect on our behavior. Their claim is \nsupported by analysis of linguistic expressions that reveal a shared \ndeep-structure called “conceptual metaphor.” I shall demonstrate this through \nthe conceptual metaphor LOVE IS A JOURNEY.",

Nevertheless, we tend to describe this emotion \nand its development in terms of a “journey.” We say of those who are in love \nthat they are in a state of “smooth sailing”; or that they are “on the rocks”; \nthey are likely to “pass through the years” or to “go their separate ways”; they \nmight “get stuck in a rut” or find that their relationship is “going nowhere.” \nUnderlying all these expressions is an association of the emotion of love with a \njourney. LOVE IS A JOURNEY is therefore a conceptual metaphor that defines a \nbroad range of linguistic metaphors. (13) [3.3] The example of LOVE IS A JOURNEY proves that we systematically borrow \nterms from one domain, a “source domain,” in order to clarify aspects of \nanother, the “target domain,” with the first domain usually being concrete and \nfamiliar (a journey, for instance) while the second is abstract and ambiguous \n(such as love). (14) This phenomenon indicates the metaphorical character of our \nconceptual system, and influences our functioning; our concepts, which are \npartly metaphorical, structure our perceptions, our behavior, and the way we \ncommunicate with one another. It can be assumed that in a society in which love \nis understood primarily as “war” and not as a “journey,” successful couplehood \nwould have a different meaning from the one we are familiar with. I will examine \nthis somewhat monolithic interpretation of metaphor more closely in my \ndiscussion of Rameau’s harmonic theory. 4. Musical Space and Orientational Metaphors",

These spatial orientations arise from \nthe way our bodies are constructed and function in our physical environment. \nOrientational metaphors give a concept spatial orientation. A number of \norientational metaphors and some linguistic expressions derived from them \nfollow: HAPPY IS UP; SAD IS DOWN I’m feeling up . That boosted my spirits. My spirits rose . You’re in high spirits. Thinking about her always gives me a lift . I’m feeling down . I’m depressed . He’s really low these days. I fell into a depression . My spirits sank .

Like Scruton, Lawrence Zbikowski, a theorist influenced by Lakoff and \nJohnson, points out that our characterization of the relative height of a pitch \ndoes not rest on empirical data related to actual location in space, but on \nmetaphorical transference; there is no literal significance to the statement \nthat D4 on the piano is “higher” than C3; after all, both of them are located on \nthe same horizontal plane of the keys. (16) The same applies to “vertical” \ninstruments: to play the “higher” D4 on the cello, we have to slide our left \nhand downwards, in such a way that in fact brings it closer to the ground. Zbikowski’s conclusion is that our culturally induced conceptualization of \nmusical space is based on the conceptual metaphor PITCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE \nRELATIONSHIPS IN VERTICAL SPACE which maps spatial orientations such as \n“up-down” onto the pitch continuum. (17) The cognitive theory of metaphor therefore \nconfirms Scruton’s fundamental insight regarding the metaphorical character of \nmusical understanding and paves the way towards its explanation. 5.

A hard body which strikes an immovable body will be reflected together with its \nmotion. (51) Figure 5 . Rameau’s analysis (click to enlarge)",

The slanted \nlines between pitches indicate the direction of the dissonances. The notes marked B are prepared \ndissonances, those marked F are unprepared. To see the similar effect of the \ncollision between physical bodies and dissonances, Rameau asks us to notice that \n“dissonance B is at rest when consonance A strikes it ( la frapper ).” And he \ncontinues: Immediately after the collision [ choc ], the consonance becomes immobile and \nobliges the dissonance to pass to C. This is effectively the place to which the \nconsonance itself could have passed but can no longer do so, since the \ndissonance has taken its place. The consonance seems to have given all its \nmotion to the dissonance. Then, Consonance D, which seems to be unshakable [ inébranlable ], \nafter having received a strike from dissonance F, obliges it to return to G, \nfrom where it started. The dissonance here seems to be reflected with all its \nmotion, after having struck an immovable consonance. (52)",

We shall see, \nfurthermore, that the seventh chord alone reigns in all the different dissonant \nchords we may use.” (53) In his view, each seventh chord contains at least one of the \nfollowing two types of dissonance: “minor dissonance,” produced by the addition \nof a minor third above the fifth of the chord in root position (i.e. a minor \nseventh above the tonic) and “major dissonance,” referring to the leading tone. \n(Rameau noted that the chord presently known as the dominant seventh chord \ncontains a dissonant interval, a tritone, between its seventh and the leading \ntone.) Because both these tones demand a clearly marked resolution, the first \ndownwards, and the second upwards, Rameau interprets both as dissonances. Figure 6 .

This term refers to a process in which a part is added either a \nthird or a fifth below the fundamental bass of a dissonant chord, in order to \nexplain various dissonances as “major dissonance” or as “minor dissonance” above \nthe chord in the supposition. (54) Being based on the same harmonic formation, real \nor theoretical, all dissonances behave in an identical way. Ideally, music, in Rameau’s view, is structured as a chain of seventh chords which resolve one into \nthe other in a regular manner ( Figure 6 ). (55) The ideal chain of seventh chords ends \non the tonic. As the only chord that does not contain the kinetic element of \ndissonance, the tonic is the starting and ultimate ending point of every \nharmonic path. At the same time, it is also the conclusion of the mechanistic \nprocess activated by the dissonance. Figure 7 . Removal of restraint schema (click to enlarge)",

From the distinction between “dynamic” chords that \ncontain dissonances and a “static” tonic, it appears that Rameau’s system admits \nat least two levels of intensity: the first, active tension produced within the \nphrase by progression between chords that are not the tonic, and, second, the \ntotal lack of tension intrinsic to the tonic. To these, one might add a third, \nintermediate level that results from the deceptive cadence which delays the \nmusical flow by a temporary interruption, but does not bring it to a standstill: \n “If we change the progression of one of the sounds in the first chord of a \nperfect cadence, we shall undoubtedly interrupt the conclusion.” (56) The deceptive \ncadence is apparently parallel to the case in which a temporary physical \nobstacle interferes with the advancement of a moving object, thereby invoking \nthe removal of restraint schema ( Figure 7 ). This schema, like the aforementioned \nforce schemas, resonates with Rameau’s contemporary scientific notion of \nmechanistic causation. 7. Conclusion",

The path schema is expressed in \nRameau’s view of harmonic progression as a directional and continuous process \nthat begins and ends at specified points; the force schema is indicated by his \nview of the chords as entities in interaction, of the dissonance as a source of \nforce, and the complete harmonic process as a structure of causality.
