    "abstract": "This paper provides a broad but comprehensive foundation for understanding the widespread practice of using the bioelectric properties of plants to create music and sound. We begin by describing how plant biosignals are harvested by several commercial electronic devices and a custom-designed interface. Then, we analyze large data samples of potential musical content generated by such technologies. Next we investigate the artistic and musical choices artists make when they interpret this data, analyzing work by British sonic artist Augustine Leudar, the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Data Garden Quartet, and Japanese composer Mamoru Fujieda. Finally we position the entire enterprise within a posthumanist semiotic framework, specifically referencing work by Uexküll, Deleuze, Krampen, Watkins, and Marder. This interpretation allows us to speculate on the nature of communication and musical collaboration that can potentially take place between the human and vegetative domains.",

In addition to their actual production of sound, there is robust evidence to show that plants are sensitive to it ( Body et al. 2019 ). This is surprising because plants do not possess specialized auditory sensory organs; nevertheless, they exhibit significant genetic transcriptional and hormonal changes when exposed to the minute rarefactive and compressive physical forces of sound pressure waves ( Jung et al. 2018 ).

Its interdisciplinary nature has made analysis challenging because “plant music” lies at an intersection of music theory, biology, electrical engineering, computer music, aesthetics, and metaphysics. In this paper we examine the practice—which we term “electronic plant music” (EPM) and “electronic plant sound” (EPS)—from a holistic, semiotic perspective. We understand EPM and EPS to mean music or sound art whose macro- or microstructure is related to, or in some way generated by, plant-derived bioelectric signals. (1) We describe how bioelectric signals arise in plants, show how they are typically acquired and processed, and analyze several large biodata samples in a way that sheds light on creative processes. We then analyze three significant EPM/S projects by Augustine Leudar, the Data Garden Quartet, and Mamoru Fujieda. The results of our musical analysis cascade into an emergent critique guided by writings of Rupert Till and Kyle Gann. We see a correlation between the amount of intervention an artist makes interpreting biosignals and the work’s stylistic affinities to ambient and postminimalist music. We conclude by revisiting the field of phytosemiotics using critical posthumanist frameworks suggested by Uexküll, Deleuze, Krampen, Watkins, Marder and others.

Nevertheless, it is prudent to embrace a holistic, “big tent” approach to understanding the phenomenon of EPM/S due to the novelty of the enterprise.

By understanding musical works as “symbolic forms,” (2) Nattiez provides strategies to “grasp the phenomena associated with the musical fact in relation to the materiality of musical works” ( Nattiez 1990 , 95), an objective that seems well-suited to our pursuit. Following Nattiez, we divide a musical work’s ontology into three levels or “registers”: the poietic (or creative) level; the neutral level, comprising the “trace” or written-out “score” (if there is one); and the esthesic level, which encompasses the audience’s response. Because the network of relationships between levels in EPM/S is quite complex, referring to these three registers brings methodological clarity. Example 1 .

These situations catalog analytical praxes or relationships between the three registers, clarifying the epistemological claims an analysis makes ( Example 1 ). Thinking in this way also proves advantageous to our study, since certain aspects of EPM/S are frustratingly inaccessible; for example, it is not always possible to know what a plant responds to when it changes metabolic processes, because we cannot ask it, and it cannot tell us. Another potential stumbling block in EPM/S is that there is no guarantee of a material trace or score for the work, as many projects exist ephemerally “in real time.” However, Nattiez shows that it is possible to speculate about one level if we know something about another. This is a frequent situation we come across in EPM/S. Example 2 . Preliminary View of the “Analytical Situation” of EPM/S (after Nattiez 1990, 76) (click to enlarge)",

However, as intricate as the situation is with Wagner, it is even more daunting in EPM/S because the actors are not all human: a vexing anthrosemiotic/phytosemiotic divide must be crossed. Indeed, EPM/S could be understood as a quintessential posthumanist activity that invites us to reevaluate relationships between ourselves and the vegetal world. Following Nattiez, Example 2 captures our preliminary assessment of EPM/S’s peculiar and complex analytical situation. This example includes a brief summary of each relationship shown on the graph.",

Next we consider the structural characteristics of this “raw” material by examining data from several devices built specifically for EPM/S applications. We continue by analyzing various poietic and esthesic processes composers (or software) use to curate these data, which becomes material ready to create sound or music. We then shift our attention by turning towards actual musical works, focusing on three substantial but very different EPM/S projects. This analysis leads us to hypothesize that the way artists interpret biodata tends towards certain musical genres or styles.

In contrast to conventional musical instruments, which make sound by converting mechanical energy into vibrational (pressure) waves, EPM/S is created by converting a plant’s electrical properties into sound pressure waves via electronic technologies. Unless plants are moved by external forces such as the wind, animals or other external actors, they do not create sounds that are audible by humans. (3) However, it has been known for well over a century that plants are electrically active organisms ( Darwin 1898 ; Burdon-Sanderson 1873 ). Plants continually produce electrical signals, which they transmit through their tissues. They generate electric potential by transporting charged ions (electrolytes) from cell to cell. Gates in cellular membranes regulate this ionic flow ( Canales, Henriquez-Valencia, and Brauchi 2018 ). Possessing no specialized cells, neurotransmitters, or synapses to facilitate electrical conductivity, signals propagate through extracellular tissue more slowly than in animals. (4) Electrical signals regulate many processes crucial to plants’ survival, including respiration, protein synthesis, gravitropism, and leaf movement ( Fromm and Lautner 2006 ). Biologists have cataloged three distinct classes of signals: action potential (AP), variation potential (VP) and system potential (SP) ( Stankovic, Witters, Zawadski, and Davies 1998 , Xie, Wu, Xing, Li, Chen, Duan, and Zhu 2021 , Johns, Hagihara, Toyoto, and Gilroy 2021 ).",

The variability is not particularly complex.

Established in 2005, the International Laboratory of Plant Neurobiology at the University of Florence (Italy) is a major center for research in this area.

However, artists will not typically have access to such elaborate apparatus. Instead, most use a non-invasive method derived from a principle first applied to so-called “lie detector tests”: galvanic conductance. Galvanic conductance is the amount of electrical conductivity between two electrodes across some substrate, such as skin or a leaf. The first to popularize this method in plants was Cleve Backster (1924–2013), a career CIA interrogation specialist whose highly questionable experiments in the 1960s involved attaching a polygraph instrument to plant leaves ( Tompkins and Bird 1973 ; Galston and Slayman 1979 ). The electrodes employed in most EPM/S applications are called TENS (“Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation”) cables, which were not originally intended for use on plants but work well nevertheless ( Larimore 1984 ).

Consequently, plants with relatively strong, fibrous leaves are typically employed in EPM/S applications. (8) Electrically conducting clips are one alternative to TENS cables, and other applications use a clip and a probe that interfaces with a plant’s root system. The length of the cable connecting the electrode to the electronics needs to be short; otherwise, the faint electrical signal can be degraded by noise. Whatever their design, electrodes typically fulfill four requirements: they are robust enough to maintain contact with the leaf surface; they should not damage the leaf; they minimize electrical noise; and they must be electrically conductive.

Some composers and sound designers have stepped into the engineering role and designed their own technologies, but this is the exception. Shedding light on this step empowers creators with agency over their material and suggests ways that new systems can be devised that are better tailored for specific aesthetic goals.

                "text": "[3.5] Released commercially in 2014 by a company called Data Garden, MIDISprout was the first widespread commercial biosonification device available to EPM/S creators. Its enormous success was due to the fact that it was simple to use, relatively inexpensive, and produced easy-to-manipulate MIDI data. Its inventor, Sam Cusumano, publicly released MIDISprout’s source code along with plans for the printed circuit board (PCB) and files for 3D printing the enclosure. (11) The MIDISprout runs a small electrical current through one TENS electrode and detects the electrical signal through the leaf from the other one. (12) This low-level voltage oscillates a 555 timing chip that generates electrical square waves. The duration of the high voltage pulse in the 555’s square wave output corresponds to the amount of galvanic conductance in the leaf. The MIDISprout system measures the duration of this “high” pulse, buffers 10 samples, shaves off the first and last sample, and computes the standard deviation of the remaining 8 samples. (13) Finally, the algorithm compares the standard deviation of the sample buffer to a threshold value set by a dial on the device itself. If the standard deviation is above the threshold value, MIDISprout generates a MIDI note scaled to the high and low values of the 8-sample data buffer. Consequently, MIDI notes are not related to the amount of conductance in a leaf itself, but rather to minute changes in electrical conductance over brief slices of time. (14) Sound or music is produced by connecting the MIDISprout into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) using a 5-pin MIDI cable. PlantWave",

The native bioelectrical signals that most biologists study—AP, VP and SP—can affect the rate of respiration, but TENS electrodes do not directly measure them. Future artists may be able to measure AP, VP and SP through more complex sensors.

We sampled a small jade plant and an echeveria succulent. These plants were used because the unusual root probe in the Damanhour electrode worked well with them. It was also a choice of necessity: the Damanhour will not output MIDI data if its software does not think it is receiving a strong signal. The data ( Examples 8a and 8b ) differed significantly from what we expected, probably because the Damanhour’s software prunes the raw data to produce EPM right “out of the box,” using its own built-in speaker. (22) Since the Damanhour schematics are not in the public domain, we could not examine them for this study. However, we noticed several important details. First, the system curiously tends to oscillate between producing MIDI notes between a fairly narrow range (what we might call “alto or soprano”) and a wider range of pitches. This effect is particularly noticeable in the jade plant data (Example 8a, in orange). If the composer or sound designer chooses to sonify this data with pitches, the musical effect will produce a sudden “opening up” in registral space that could create a pleasing outcome. We have no explanation for the very slow rising and falling arch in the middle of the echeveria data set (Example 8b, in purple, between 140 and 190 minutes), which was not observed elsewhere.

Our passive amplifier operated without sending any voltage through the plant—and lacked a 555 timing chip—leaving ourselves open to a noisier biosignal. The entire system had to be operated on battery power, because plugging our laptop into a wall socket substantially increased the electronic noise. Although our datasets were each only about an hour long, we collected 7980 MIDI notes for analysis. The data appears more randomly distributed than any other device, but the results ( Examples 9a and 9b ) could still be usable in some EPM/S applications. We noticed that the snake plant generated a significantly wider range of MIDI notes than the croton plant, suggesting that the system was in fact transcribing biosignals that were structurally different from plant to plant. Both plants produced almost exactly the same average MIDI note (62.96 vs. 62.94).

When we hooked our croton and snake plants up to Scion, we noticed the croton produced a small, constantly changing output signal, but the snake plant did not induce any variation whatsoever even when the sensitivity dial on Scion was turned to maximum. (23) Consequently we swapped the snake plant for an aloe plant to produce the data shown in purple colors in Example 10 . This example shows two consecutive 50-minute datasets of Scion’s four CV outputs sampled at audio rate (44.1 kHz). (24) As can be seen most clearly in the aloe plant data (in cool colors), Scion’s four CV outputs progressively produce shorter segments of variable data, suggesting that each channel incrementally raises the user-defined threshold value in Cusumano’s algorithm. This would explain why the fourth channel in each dataset has the longest flat voltage output (flat lines). To augment our analysis of Scion’s capabilities we sampled its “raw” 555 output jack at audio rate to explore the structure of the square waves it produces. Example 11 shows 1 second of 555 output.

For example, a sound designer might modulate a periodic control signal that generates a pitch ostinato by a signal like the one produced by the aloe plant. The effect might be an ostinato that repeats many times, only to be dramatically altered at unpredictable intervals.

However, l’Anson’s observation could be amended: a “useful” data stream ought to provide enough shape that an artist can create music or sound that has some variation, but not so much that it is just random noise. Balancing these two extremes is part of the esthesic work of the engineer, who responds to the idiosyncrasies inherent in plant biosignals to build a device that can supply the composer with an appropriate flow of usable data.

As discussed by Grond and Hermann ( 2012 ), data sonification employs one medium to represent something more than itself, and typically lays claim to “explanatory powers” by occupying a continuum somewhere between “mere illustration” and music. Perhaps the most straightforward representational strategy in EPM/S would be simply to map each MIDI value to a pitched note, resulting in a relatively unmitigated presentation of data. In this case, the main poietic decision the artist makes concerns the choice of instrument to represent the data. But as we have seen in the systems we have explored, these data frequently seem quite tonally unorganized. A common technique is to process MIDI data with a quantizer, which can map chromatic notes to diatonic scales (or any other desired pitch collection). Similarly, quantizers can operate in the rhythmic or time domain by moving note onsets and offsets to align with pulses in metric grids. Although EPM/S artists typically quantize pitch according to an equal-tempered scale, there is no inherent reason other tuning systems cannot be used instead. Devices such as the PlantWave, Damanhour, and Scion have built-in quantization options that provide little flexibility in this respect. DAWs present a much broader range of choices, and software such as Max/MSP or pd allow for considerably greater freedom. Audio Example 1 .

Even representing MIDI data as pitch is only one possibility among many: the same data can trigger indexed sound samples. One such implementation is our “synthetic birdsong.” First, software detects transients in a nightingale song, and then the song is sliced into short, indexed chunks— each beginning with a transient.

(28) Leudar intended to make “activity in this network tangible through sound in real time and immerse the public in the complexity of these processes” ( Leudar 2018 , 518), so his practice was clearly related to data sonification. As the basis of his sound construction, Leudar sampled ultrasonic sounds in the rainforest and pitch-shifted them downwards into human hearing range. He also created synthesized sounds, which were modified through various filtering, delay, reverberation, granularization and pitch-shifting techniques. His system actively panned these sounds around many loudspeakers that were placed next to trees’ biosensors. If a particular signal appeared in one tree and then in another, the system panned sounds along that pathway. (29) Leudar sonified an inferred underground bioelectric communication network that presumably operated in a small patch of forest. While he conceded that this work is still preliminary, Leudar’s installations were impressive demonstrations of sophisticated sound-processing techniques. They were also notable for his sensitivity to and incorporation of the rainforest’s native soundscape. Example 12 .

This is misleading and deprives the artist of an opportunity to present the true electrical processes happening within the plant. ( Leudar 2014 ) Touching plants does typically result in a rapid and dramatic electrical response, caused by the fact that humans both produce electric charge and can store it in our bodies. Example 12 illustrates how touching a plant leaf near a TENS electrode dramatically changes whatever signal the plant produces on its own. Leudar’s approach to EPS interpreted plant biodata in a way that attempted to elucidate its own internal structural characteristics. He drew a strict line between anthrosphere and phytosphere by discouraging physical contact between the two, heightening perceived boundaries. Audio Example 3 .

Shortly before announcing the commercial production of the MIDISprout, three of their members—Sam Cusumano, Joe Patitucci, and Alex Tyson—produced a sound installation at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from April 13–15, 2012. Two hour-long tracks are available on Bandcamp and other online platforms. (30) Data Garden’s approach was to assemble an imaginary “bioband” of four distinct voices corresponding to invented musicians: lead synthesizer, rhythm, bass synthesizer, and ambient/effect pads. Data Garden’s playful approach lowered the stakes of their musical endeavor. Their sound installation layered dense collections of repeating diatonic and pentatonic notes over ambient pads. At times the textures varied, though the pitch patterns themselves were somewhat repetitive. Audio Example 3 gives a general sense of the first day’s soundscape. Audio Example 4 .

This could have happened if their software used MIDI notes themselves from the plant interface to trigger such changes—a technique we suggested above in paragraph [5.3]. MIDI notes are not constrained to represent only pitches: a specific note (or sequence of notes) can be programmed to effectively change the tempo of a musical stratum, e.g. doubling or halving its speed. Whether or not Data Garden’s software worked in this way, several such changes are audible in the lead synthesizer part ( Audio Example 4 ). Although this feature is prominent in the second day of Data Garden’s installation, both days’ music employs a constrained reservoir of diatonic or pentatonic pitches to generate slowly moving bass lines, and a larger set of diatonic pitches for more animated treble lines.",

I soon started to make a composition program based on plant potentials with [the] computer music program “MAX” so that I [could] find melodies in them.

Fujieda then had an intuition that these data contained something musical but he does not claim that the material itself was musical. Subsequently Fujieda exercised his own musical poiesis by writing a Max patch to find musical structures (“melodic patterns”) in the “incessantly proliferating” stream of data. He finally arranged these melodic patterns into compositions, completing the composer’s poietic process. Audio Example 5 .

Our segmentation illustrates an enormous amount of repetition in the melodic contour and pitch profile. As indicated in Example 15 , one four-element melodic contour segment, <-, +, -, ->, highlighted in bright orange, accounts for 56 of 160 contour changes. Together with the four-element contour segment that frequently follows it, <+, -, -, +>, shown in lighter orange, the two account for 96 of 160 contour changes. As Example 16 shows, the pitch content also contains frequent repetition, particularly the two incipit patterns <5, 4, 5, 4, 3> and <4, 3, 4, 3, 2> shown in bright orange and dark blue respectively (incidentally, the second incipit pattern is a literal transposition of the first, down one diatonic step.) However, the piece does not sound repetitive. How does Fujieda achieve variety? Fujieda structures the rhythm much differently than the pitch domain. As shown in Example 17 , the durations (analyzed as eighth notes) are much more freely organized: it is not possible to find lengthy repeated patterns in the rhythmic dimension, though 15 of 20 phrases end in a relatively long duration, indicated in orange.

Then I bundled some of them as a “pattern.” ( Fujieda 2000 , 2) These patterns emerge in our analysis as the repeating contours and pitch patterns. Given their stepwise simplicity, they are likely transcribed from short segments of plant data. It is clear that Fujieda’s content has been ordered, manipulated, and organized with a fairly strong hand, though his rhythmic durations are less predictable. Similar melodic and rhythmic structures occur in the other three contrapuntal voices. Here we make an inductive poietic claim based on analysis of the immanent structures of a written-out score, revealing Fujieda’s poietic task as twofold. First, Fujieda selected appropriate biodata segments from data produced by the Dogane’s Plantron, and then he arranged and transmuted these segments through the lens of several cultural traditions to produce a satisfactory score. Seen in this way, Fujieda’s technique of weaving together simple, repeating material into ever-changing textures, filtered through the vocabulary of different musical cultures, is remarkably complex. 6.

While bands such as Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream are frequently cited as important influences, Brian Eno’s 1978 album “Music for Airports” is generally considered as an exemplar in the genre. Eno defined his view of ambient in opposition to what he called “canned music”: Whereas the extant canned music companies proceed from the basis of regularizing environments by blanketing their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncrasies, Ambient Music is intended to enhance these. . . . And whereas their intention is to “brighten” the environment by adding stimulus to it (thus supposedly alleviating the tedium of routine tasks and levelling out the natural ups and downs of the body rhythms) Ambient Music is intended to induce calm and a space to think.

The “dial-it-in” approach of the PlantWave and Damanhour devices—which allow users to play music simply by selecting a preprogrammed patch—does not allow people to make these choices: instead, the software does all the work.

A non-teleological musical approach allows pause, the creation of place, and the opportunity to slow the frantic pace of life for a moment. . . . Ambient music sets a context, a sense of place that is calming and serene, re- establishing a sense of home. It draws the listener inwards, stilling time and moving the deep listener into a sense of kairos , to a greater or lesser extent. (Till 2017)",

Whereas Marder’s second category is related to the kairotic view of time, seasonal changes and cyclical temporalities are connected to notions of repetition. What musical structures could transpose this element of phytotemporality into sound or music? According to Kyle Gann, postminimalist music often features phase-shifting of repetitive musical ideas, additive and subtractive processes, a “small, circumscribed set of materials,” as well as relatively consonant harmonies. He continues: A postminimalist piece seems self-contained, not pointing outward; the references to other music sometimes contained therein are cut off from their source, preserved in abstract notes but not in emotional content, like a fly preserved in amber. . . . We are given only a circumscribed fragment of the musical universe to work with—and even within that truncated segment there is more going on than our ears and minds can account for. . . . The world, postminimalism seems to tell us, is understandable, but our perception is so limited that it (our perception) is easily overwhelmed by the interaction of even a few restricted elements and processes.

Keeping in mind that assigning a style to a piece is often quite subjective, our representation nevertheless suggests a correlation. On one extreme lies Leudar, who discouraged the audience from touching plants, producing sound that aligns with the ambient genre most convincingly. In the middle lies the Data Garden Quartet, which neither encouraged nor discouraged listeners to touch their plants, but clearly used an array of quantizers to mediate data. Their music has qualities of both ambient and postminimalism. Fujieda extensively manipulated his biodata; in our view, his music shares the most affinity with postminimalism. Although our hypothesis is obviously preliminary on account of its small dataset, more work in this area could provide further insight. 7.

If the phytosphere includes its own language of signals proper to itself, it is possible that it also communicates to us.

What grants us the right to have an encounter at all is the discovery of traces of ourselves in the plant domain, and vice-versa ( Marder 2013 , 9). Critiquing binary systems of thinking facilitates this encounter. Plants show us how tenuous such delineations are, even between our respective creative domains. Holly Watkins has written persuasively on the creative energy of plants ( physis ) and humans ( techne ), insisting that it is not possible to “enforce absolute distinctions between the two” ( Watkins 2018 , 8). Her work challenges the notion of human exceptionalism by showing the kinship between sound in the natural world and sound in human culture.",

                "text": "[7.6] In some EPM/S projects (particularly Leudar’s), human creators venture to encounter the phytosphere with minimal intervention. Although Data Garden’s lighthearted association of plants with performers in an imaginary ambient band may help some listeners better perceive musical forms by invoking familiar anthropocentric signposts, such markers unquestionably intrude into the vegetal world, which knows nothing of the peculiar structures of human music-making. Such insouciant experiments stray perilously close to a kind of techno-utopia that further colonizes the phytosphere. Future studies should consider the extent to which EPM/S projects participate in a resource-oriented extractive economy that enables exploitation of the natural world, or genuinely try to facilitate a deeper encounter with another realm of life.",

Plants do not normally participate in the human musical world on our terms, and we would be hard-pressed to describe what the sounds “proper to plants” might be. If one party seemingly has no stake in the outcome, how can true collaboration begin? To skeptics, EPM/S may seem like a triumphalist technological exercise that economically delivers an “incessantly proliferating” source of quasi-random information for sound designers to shape. Does EPM/S lend credibility to a false hope that we can access the vegetal through opaque layers of software and hardware, or is it a fertile field for mounting challenges to a reified metaphysics? Critical assessment of musical projects can provide much-needed perspectives to these questions and to the many others this article has posed.",

Like Fujieda, who believed that bioelectric signals contained “traces of [plants’] daily life,” we remain optimistic and fascinated by the possibilities of EPM/S—not just by the way it promises to open up encounters with life-forms we depend on but still know so little about, but also by the way it challenges us to view the immense diversity of life with renewed wonder, awe, and empathy.
