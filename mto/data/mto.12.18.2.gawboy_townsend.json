    "abstract": "Alexander Scriabin imagined hisPrometheus: Poem of Fire, op. 60, as a spectacular “dual symphony” of light and sound. For much of the work’s history, however, the light part remained enigmatic and technologically unperformable, contributing to a vicious cycle between performance and analysis. An incomplete understanding of the function of the lights resulted in a disregard for Scriabin’s lighting notation in performances, while the unavailability of accurate, convincing performances has inhibited curiosity regarding the lights’ full analytical potential.This paper reassesses the relationship between music and lights inPrometheus, drawing upon new research regarding the nature of Scriabin’s vision. We explore the potential of the lights to perform a real-time visual analysis of the music using video excerpts from our 2010 performance with the Yale Symphony Orchestra.",

Shorter versions of this article were presented at Music Theory Midwest in Oxford Ohio (2010) and the Society for Music Theory Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (2010). The authors wish to thank Seth Monahan, Kathryn Graber, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions regarding earlier drafts. Return to text 2.  For example, Jennifer Tipton, the designer of a 2010 lighted piano recital of Scriabin’s music entitled “Spectral Scriabin,” made a point to distance her work from Scriabin’s vision:  http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/alexander-scriabin/ . And although the kinetic artist Norman Perryman claimed to be channeling various Scriabinesque ideas as he painted during a 2010 performance of the  Poem of Ecstasy , his performance only loosely engaged Scriabin’s ideas regarding color and music. ( See the YouTube performance here. ) Scriabin did not include a multimedia component in the piano music or the  Poem of Ecstasy , so there are no explicit directions for designers to either follow or reject. But designers take similar liberties with  Prometheus , which did include a part for colored lights; see section IV. Return to text 3.  A selection of these sources includes  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] ,  1911a ,  1911b ,  1929 ; and  Myers 1914–15 . Return to text 4.  Performative impossibility as an aesthetic value in Scriabin’s music has been explored by Taruskin ( 1997 ), and Morrison ( 1998  and  2002 ). Return to text 5.  A brief history of lighted performances of  Prometheus  can be found in  Galeev and Vanechkina 2010 , and  Vanechkina 2012 . Return to text 6.   Scriabin 1911/1913 , archived under the Bibliothèque Nationale catalogue number Res. Vma 228. The score has been described by a number of scholars, including Lobanova ( 2004 ), Dillon ( 2002 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [2000] ), MacDonald ( 1983 ), Horst-Lederer ( 1980 ). Return to text 7.  For example, as of 11/1/11, the Wikipedia entry on “clavier à lumières” contained numerous inaccuracies and contradictions ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tastiera_per_luce ). It stated that a table correlating pitch and color according to Scriabin’s “synesthetic system” “appears in the [published] score.” Scriabin was not a synesthete as we have come to define the term today, and no such table appeared in the first edition score. Wikipedia then provides a list of colors mapped to pitch classes arranged as an ascending chromatic scale. Not only does a chromatic arrangement represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the premise behind Scriabin’s system, but some of Wikipedia’s tone-color assignments differ significantly from those appearing in the Parisian score manuscript. Wikipedia also states, “the ‘luce’ part is notated . . . [as] two parts, one proceeding on the circle of fifths and the other following the tonal centre of the music.” Neither statement is accurate.  Return to text 8.   Baker 2002 , 73–78;  Galeev and Vanechkina 2001 , 357–61; and  Dillon 2002 , 2–25.  Return to text 9.  When the notation is realized, the lights project colors corresponding to the notated pitches, not sounds. Return to text 10.  The orthography of Example 5 follows that of  Sabaneev 1911b , 289. This article and its famous presentation of the mystic collection as stacked fourths became available to western analysts in  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] . Scriabin’s sketches for  Prometheus  reveal that he experimented with mystic chord arrangements in stacked thirds and stacked fourths. In both, the fundamental of the collection remains the same. See  Lobanova 2002 , 7–8 and  Eberle 1978 , 64. Return to text 11.  Sabaneev revealed the relationship between the fast  luce  harmonies and the mystic chord fundamental in his memoir. Scriabin explained, “it is but very simple. You see, I have two lines of color flowing throughout the whole Poem. The first [faster-moving line] corresponds to the music, the harmonies, and therefore often the fundamental bass” ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 262). This relationship has long been acknowledged by scholars, including Gleich ( 1963 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [1977] ), Eberle ( 1978 ), Pople ( 1989 ), Sabbagh ( 2001 ), and Lobanova ( 2002 ). Dillon ( 2002 , 29–74) explores this relationship in great detail. His mystic-chord analysis of the entire composition confirms that the fast luce part matches the fundamental bass of the mystic chords with few exceptions, and nearly all those exceptions could be interpreted as errors. Return to text 12.  By extension, the sustained  B ♮  in the upper strings throughout measures 1–12 would also need to be explained as a non-collectional tone. Return to text 13.  Perle ( 1984 , 109–110; 117–18) argued for 8-28, then for 9-10; Pople ( 1989 , 133–36) carefully considered both 9-10 and 10-4 before coming down in favor of 9-10; Cheong ( 1990 , 125–39) swept all three aside to claim 9-12 as the basis for op. 67 no.1; Lehrdahl ( 2004 , 321–33) concluded that op. 67 no. 1 was “essentially octatonic with whole-tone and mystic offshoots”; Kallis ( 2008 , 1.8; 3.16–17) summarizes the merits of previous arguments before supporting a 9-10 interpretation. Return to text 14.  Perle ( 1984 ) and Cheong ( 1993  and  1996 ) have established the importance of orthography in Scriabin’s music.  Return to text 15.  This has not necessarily inhibited an actual understanding of the relationship between the fast  luce  part and the harmonies. In his set-theory analysis of  Prometheus , Baker wrote, “an element of each 6-34 is nearly always represented in the color organ. This pitch class is almost invariably the third element in the normal-order form.” Although Baker insisted that “we need not accept superposed fourths as the basic form of the chord,” he acknowledged that fourth-stacking resulted in a correlation between mystic chord root and the pitches of the slow  luce  ( Baker 1986 , 258–59). Return to text 16.  Scriabin’s compositional protégé, Nicolai Roslavets, used a similar approach to tonal organization. Bazayev ( 2009 ) investigates how Roslavets generated arrays of orthographically-distinctive pitches by transposing his synthetic scales through a fifth-series. Return to text 17.  Lerhdahl ( 1988 ) identifies a gap between what he calls compositional grammar and listening grammar in serialism. See also empirical study by Krumhansl, Sandell, and Sergeant ( 1987 ). Tymoczko ( 2011 , 24–25) presents some similar arguments regarding tonal music. Return to text 18.  Other colors interrupt the whole-tone progression of the slow  luce  part in several places. The sustained  B ♭  (metallic leaden grey) gives way to  B ♮  (blue) and C (plain red) within measures 149-68. Additionally, a brief tri-color break in measures 305–9 of  D ♭  (violet), F (dark red) and A (grass green) separates the slow  luce  progression from C to D. Finally, the printed score contains an  E ♯  in bar 469, chromatically passing between E (blue-green) and  F ♯  (dark blue-violet); however, Scriabin crossed this  E ♯  out in the Parisian score. Scholars have advanced various explanations for these breaks; see Pople  1989 , 244–47 and Dillon  2002 , 60–74.  Return to text 19.  Pople ( 1989 , 234–43) identifies only four passages of literal repetition: i) measures 26–46; ii) measures 67–82; iii) measures 115–30; and iv) measures 130–45. In the latter half of the piece, the third segment (iii) returns first at measures 309–24, followed by segment (i) at 370–90, then (ii) and (iv) at measures 391–406 and 467–507 respectively. The longest of these sections is only twenty measures, a relatively small proportion of a composition over six hundred measures long. Return to text 20.  Scriabin’s interest in Blavatsky’s writings and other theosophical sources is well-documented. In a letter to his common-law wife Tatiana Schloezer dated April 29, 1905, Scriabin wrote, “ The Key to Theosophy  [by Helena Blavatsky] is a wonderful book. You will be amazed how close it is to my thought” ( Scriabin 1965 , 369). Scriabin’s brother-in-law, Boris de Schloezer, described how avidly Scriabin read Blavatsky’s  The Secret Doctrine , marking significant passages in pencil ( 1987 [1923] , 72).  Return to text 21.  Like Hesiod, Blavatsky believed the modern human “race” had reached the fifth stage of development, and she predicted two future stages. In this context, “race” refers not to ethnic/cultural/physiognomic difference but rather a class of (mythic) being. For example, Blavatsky’s Root Race I consisted of disembodied and mindless spiritual shadows, while Root Race III was comprised of giants, human-animal hybrids, and divine hermaphrodites.  Return to text 22.  When Boris de Schloezer visited Scriabin in Switzerland in 1907, he found the composer “deeply engaged in reading works by Mme. Blavatsky, Annie Besant, C. W. Leadbeater, and other theosophists. His conversation was full of theosophical allusions to Manvantara, Pralaya, Seven Planes, Seven Races, and the like; he used these terms volubly as if they were familiar to all and as if they reflected incontrovertible truths” ( Schloezer 1987 [1923] , 67). Return to text 23.  The yellow Color Stage V begins in measures 309–24 with the rapture episode drawn from measures 115–30. Measures 325–40 contain a varied orchestral rendition of the piano’s solo from measures 131–38. In measures 370–90, Scriabin brings back the opening dialogue between piano and orchestra from measures 27–47, and then reprises the “trés anime” episode from measures 67–80 in measures 391–404. Return to text 24.  Scriabin’s engagement with the mystic phase of Russian Symbolism dates from at least 1909. During the composition of  Prometheus , Scriabin read essays by Viacheslav Ivanov collected in  By the Stars  ( Ivanov 1909 ). Ivanov’s essays “Presentiments and Portents: The New Organic Era and the Theater of the Future” and “Wagner and the Dionysian Rite” help contextualize aspects of Scriabin’s creative ambitions. See  Morrison 1998 . Return to text 25.  MacDonald ( 1978 ) describes two performances that omitted the slow  luce : one by the Dutch Residentie Orkest, conducted by Michael Gielen on March 24, 1973; another by the Oxford University Orchestra, conducted by MacDonald himself on June 22, 1979. Return to text 26.  Of course, no visual recording could possibly capture a viewer’s experience of a live performance. In a live performance, the viewer has the freedom to choose what he or she looks at in real time. In a visual recording the editor has already made many of these decisions. In each of the recordings discussed, the visual continuity of the light part is broken by cuts to performer close-ups. Return to text 27.  While they did not fully realize the colors of the  luce , the producers of the Tokyo NHK Orchestra did have access to the Parisian score, and their effects are quite spectacular.  Return to text 28.  The first public lighted performance of  Prometheus  used a projection machine designed by Edison Testing Laboratories. Lights were mounted on a rotating belt equipped with mirrors which enabled the colors to be projected onto layers of gauze sheets hung behind the orchestra ( Plummer 1915 ,  Baker 2002 ). This innovation still restricted the lights to a relatively small area upstage, falling short of Scriabin’s desire to fill the hall with fire. Even today, some modern productions project lights on a screen, drawing upon this relatively inexpensive and practical precedent.  Return to text 29.  The full performance may be viewed on YouTube:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3B7uQ5K0IU . Return to text 30.  Both fast and slow  luce  parts were performed by musicians during the show. For the slow  luce , we pre-wrote cues controlled by a light board. The fast  luce  installation was connected to a midi keyboard played by a musician who sat among other members of the orchestra. Return to text 31.  Our experience with our  luce  thus somewhat paralleled Scriabin’s own. The instrument did not perform according to our imagined ideal, and so we had to modify our plan to fit our circumstances. Such an experience is intrinsic to the act of performance, and, we might argue, central to the creative aesthetics of  Prometheus  itself. Return to text 32.  A performance by the Berlin Philharmonic (1992) belongs to this tradition. Some brightening and dimming occurred as the lights shifted from one area of the concert hall to the next, but in general, dynamics and effects were minimal.  Return to text 33.  For example, Fields ( 1969 ) wrote, “I must confess that I could see little connection between the lights and the music. It was fun to watch the lights blink on and off, but the intended higher level of experience escaped me. The fault, of course, may lie more in Scriabin’s conception than in this or any execution of the work. It was difficult, moreover, to focus attention on the orchestra’s contribution, for the novelty of the light show distracted from the music.” Return to text 34.  For example, in a 2011 New York Times review of “Spectral Scriabin,” a lighted piano recital, Anthony Tomassini wrote, “Ms. Tipton’s designs here were fairly tame . . . for most of the performance the lighting effects were quite simple: circles of pale, overlapping colors projected on a screen behind the pianist and on the floor around the piano. Maybe Ms. Tipton knew what she was up to. Without too much intrusion from lighting designs, the focus remained on the music” ( Tommasini 2011 ).  Return to text 35.  Blavatsky described  Akâsa  and related forces as a kind of “Life-Electricity” ( 1888 , vol. 1, 15; vol. 2, 250), endowing the current running through Scriabin’s  luce  with an extra layer of mystical significance. Dimova ( 2009 ) investigates the way Scriabin’s use of electricity may have resonated with metaphors of light and energy in Symbolist literature. Return to text Shorter versions of this article were presented at Music Theory Midwest in Oxford Ohio (2010) and the Society for Music Theory Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (2010). The authors wish to thank Seth Monahan, Kathryn Graber, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions regarding earlier drafts. For example, Jennifer Tipton, the designer of a 2010 lighted piano recital of Scriabin’s music entitled “Spectral Scriabin,” made a point to distance her work from Scriabin’s vision:  http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/alexander-scriabin/ . And although the kinetic artist Norman Perryman claimed to be channeling various Scriabinesque ideas as he painted during a 2010 performance of the  Poem of Ecstasy , his performance only loosely engaged Scriabin’s ideas regarding color and music. ( See the YouTube performance here. ) Scriabin did not include a multimedia component in the piano music or the  Poem of Ecstasy , so there are no explicit directions for designers to either follow or reject. But designers take similar liberties with  Prometheus , which did include a part for colored lights; see section IV. A selection of these sources includes  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] ,  1911a ,  1911b ,  1929 ; and  Myers 1914–15 . Performative impossibility as an aesthetic value in Scriabin’s music has been explored by Taruskin ( 1997 ), and Morrison ( 1998  and  2002 ). A brief history of lighted performances of  Prometheus  can be found in  Galeev and Vanechkina 2010 , and  Vanechkina 2012 . Scriabin 1911/1913 , archived under the Bibliothèque Nationale catalogue number Res. Vma 228. The score has been described by a number of scholars, including Lobanova ( 2004 ), Dillon ( 2002 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [2000] ), MacDonald ( 1983 ), Horst-Lederer ( 1980 ). For example, as of 11/1/11, the Wikipedia entry on “clavier à lumières” contained numerous inaccuracies and contradictions ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tastiera_per_luce ). It stated that a table correlating pitch and color according to Scriabin’s “synesthetic system” “appears in the [published] score.” Scriabin was not a synesthete as we have come to define the term today, and no such table appeared in the first edition score. Wikipedia then provides a list of colors mapped to pitch classes arranged as an ascending chromatic scale. Not only does a chromatic arrangement represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the premise behind Scriabin’s system, but some of Wikipedia’s tone-color assignments differ significantly from those appearing in the Parisian score manuscript. Wikipedia also states, “the ‘luce’ part is notated . . . [as] two parts, one proceeding on the circle of fifths and the other following the tonal centre of the music.” Neither statement is accurate.  Baker 2002 , 73–78;  Galeev and Vanechkina 2001 , 357–61; and  Dillon 2002 , 2–25.  When the notation is realized, the lights project colors corresponding to the notated pitches, not sounds. The orthography of Example 5 follows that of  Sabaneev 1911b , 289. This article and its famous presentation of the mystic collection as stacked fourths became available to western analysts in  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] . Scriabin’s sketches for  Prometheus  reveal that he experimented with mystic chord arrangements in stacked thirds and stacked fourths. In both, the fundamental of the collection remains the same. See  Lobanova 2002 , 7–8 and  Eberle 1978 , 64. Sabaneev revealed the relationship between the fast  luce  harmonies and the mystic chord fundamental in his memoir. Scriabin explained, “it is but very simple. You see, I have two lines of color flowing throughout the whole Poem. The first [faster-moving line] corresponds to the music, the harmonies, and therefore often the fundamental bass” ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 262). This relationship has long been acknowledged by scholars, including Gleich ( 1963 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [1977] ), Eberle ( 1978 ), Pople ( 1989 ), Sabbagh ( 2001 ), and Lobanova ( 2002 ). Dillon ( 2002 , 29–74) explores this relationship in great detail. His mystic-chord analysis of the entire composition confirms that the fast luce part matches the fundamental bass of the mystic chords with few exceptions, and nearly all those exceptions could be interpreted as errors. By extension, the sustained B♮ in the upper strings throughout measures 1–12 would also need to be explained as a non-collectional tone. Perle ( 1984 , 109–110; 117–18) argued for 8-28, then for 9-10; Pople ( 1989 , 133–36) carefully considered both 9-10 and 10-4 before coming down in favor of 9-10; Cheong ( 1990 , 125–39) swept all three aside to claim 9-12 as the basis for op. 67 no.1; Lehrdahl ( 2004 , 321–33) concluded that op. 67 no. 1 was “essentially octatonic with whole-tone and mystic offshoots”; Kallis ( 2008 , 1.8; 3.16–17) summarizes the merits of previous arguments before supporting a 9-10 interpretation. Perle ( 1984 ) and Cheong ( 1993  and  1996 ) have established the importance of orthography in Scriabin’s music.  This has not necessarily inhibited an actual understanding of the relationship between the fast  luce  part and the harmonies.

Shorter versions of this article were presented at Music Theory Midwest in Oxford Ohio (2010) and the Society for Music Theory Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (2010). The authors wish to thank Seth Monahan, Kathryn Graber, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions regarding earlier drafts. Return to text2.  For example, Jennifer Tipton, the designer of a 2010 lighted piano recital of Scriabin’s music entitled “Spectral Scriabin,” made a point to distance her work from Scriabin’s vision:  http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/alexander-scriabin/ . And although the kinetic artist Norman Perryman claimed to be channeling various Scriabinesque ideas as he painted during a 2010 performance of the  Poem of Ecstasy , his performance only loosely engaged Scriabin’s ideas regarding color and music. ( See the YouTube performance here. ) Scriabin did not include a multimedia component in the piano music or the  Poem of Ecstasy , so there are no explicit directions for designers to either follow or reject. But designers take similar liberties with  Prometheus , which did include a part for colored lights; see section IV. Return to text3.  A selection of these sources includes  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] ,  1911a ,  1911b ,  1929 ; and  Myers 1914–15 . Return to text4.  Performative impossibility as an aesthetic value in Scriabin’s music has been explored by Taruskin ( 1997 ), and Morrison ( 1998  and  2002 ). Return to text5.  A brief history of lighted performances of  Prometheus  can be found in  Galeev and Vanechkina 2010 , and  Vanechkina 2012 . Return to text6.   Scriabin 1911/1913 , archived under the Bibliothèque Nationale catalogue number Res. Vma 228. The score has been described by a number of scholars, including Lobanova ( 2004 ), Dillon ( 2002 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [2000] ), MacDonald ( 1983 ), Horst-Lederer ( 1980 ). Return to text7.  For example, as of 11/1/11, the Wikipedia entry on “clavier à lumières” contained numerous inaccuracies and contradictions ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tastiera_per_luce ). It stated that a table correlating pitch and color according to Scriabin’s “synesthetic system” “appears in the [published] score.” Scriabin was not a synesthete as we have come to define the term today, and no such table appeared in the first edition score. Wikipedia then provides a list of colors mapped to pitch classes arranged as an ascending chromatic scale. Not only does a chromatic arrangement represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the premise behind Scriabin’s system, but some of Wikipedia’s tone-color assignments differ significantly from those appearing in the Parisian score manuscript. Wikipedia also states, “the ‘luce’ part is notated . . . [as] two parts, one proceeding on the circle of fifths and the other following the tonal centre of the music.” Neither statement is accurate.  Return to text8.   Baker 2002 , 73–78;  Galeev and Vanechkina 2001 , 357–61; and  Dillon 2002 , 2–25.  Return to text9.  When the notation is realized, the lights project colors corresponding to the notated pitches, not sounds. Return to text10.  The orthography of Example 5 follows that of  Sabaneev 1911b , 289. This article and its famous presentation of the mystic collection as stacked fourths became available to western analysts in  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] . Scriabin’s sketches for  Prometheus  reveal that he experimented with mystic chord arrangements in stacked thirds and stacked fourths. In both, the fundamental of the collection remains the same. See  Lobanova 2002 , 7–8 and  Eberle 1978 , 64. Return to text11.  Sabaneev revealed the relationship between the fast  luce  harmonies and the mystic chord fundamental in his memoir. Scriabin explained, “it is but very simple. You see, I have two lines of color flowing throughout the whole Poem. The first [faster-moving line] corresponds to the music, the harmonies, and therefore often the fundamental bass” ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 262). This relationship has long been acknowledged by scholars, including Gleich ( 1963 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [1977] ), Eberle ( 1978 ), Pople ( 1989 ), Sabbagh ( 2001 ), and Lobanova ( 2002 ). Dillon ( 2002 , 29–74) explores this relationship in great detail. His mystic-chord analysis of the entire composition confirms that the fast luce part matches the fundamental bass of the mystic chords with few exceptions, and nearly all those exceptions could be interpreted as errors. Return to text12.  By extension, the sustained  B ♮  in the upper strings throughout measures 1–12 would also need to be explained as a non-collectional tone. Return to text13.  Perle ( 1984 , 109–110; 117–18) argued for 8-28, then for 9-10; Pople ( 1989 , 133–36) carefully considered both 9-10 and 10-4 before coming down in favor of 9-10; Cheong ( 1990 , 125–39) swept all three aside to claim 9-12 as the basis for op. 67 no.1; Lehrdahl ( 2004 , 321–33) concluded that op. 67 no. 1 was “essentially octatonic with whole-tone and mystic offshoots”; Kallis ( 2008 , 1.8; 3.16–17) summarizes the merits of previous arguments before supporting a 9-10 interpretation. Return to text14.  Perle ( 1984 ) and Cheong ( 1993  and  1996 ) have established the importance of orthography in Scriabin’s music.  Return to text15.  This has not necessarily inhibited an actual understanding of the relationship between the fast  luce  part and the harmonies. In his set-theory analysis of  Prometheus , Baker wrote, “an element of each 6-34 is nearly always represented in the color organ. This pitch class is almost invariably the third element in the normal-order form.” Although Baker insisted that “we need not accept superposed fourths as the basic form of the chord,” he acknowledged that fourth-stacking resulted in a correlation between mystic chord root and the pitches of the slow  luce  ( Baker 1986 , 258–59). Return to text16.  Scriabin’s compositional protégé, Nicolai Roslavets, used a similar approach to tonal organization. Bazayev ( 2009 ) investigates how Roslavets generated arrays of orthographically-distinctive pitches by transposing his synthetic scales through a fifth-series. Return to text17.  Lerhdahl ( 1988 ) identifies a gap between what he calls compositional grammar and listening grammar in serialism. See also empirical study by Krumhansl, Sandell, and Sergeant ( 1987 ). Tymoczko ( 2011 , 24–25) presents some similar arguments regarding tonal music. Return to text18.  Other colors interrupt the whole-tone progression of the slow  luce  part in several places. The sustained  B ♭  (metallic leaden grey) gives way to  B ♮  (blue) and C (plain red) within measures 149-68. Additionally, a brief tri-color break in measures 305–9 of  D ♭  (violet), F (dark red) and A (grass green) separates the slow  luce  progression from C to D. Finally, the printed score contains an  E ♯  in bar 469, chromatically passing between E (blue-green) and  F ♯  (dark blue-violet); however, Scriabin crossed this  E ♯  out in the Parisian score. Scholars have advanced various explanations for these breaks; see Pople  1989 , 244–47 and Dillon  2002 , 60–74.  Return to text19.  Pople ( 1989 , 234–43) identifies only four passages of literal repetition: i) measures 26–46; ii) measures 67–82; iii) measures 115–30; and iv) measures 130–45. In the latter half of the piece, the third segment (iii) returns first at measures 309–24, followed by segment (i) at 370–90, then (ii) and (iv) at measures 391–406 and 467–507 respectively. The longest of these sections is only twenty measures, a relatively small proportion of a composition over six hundred measures long. Return to text20.  Scriabin’s interest in Blavatsky’s writings and other theosophical sources is well-documented. In a letter to his common-law wife Tatiana Schloezer dated April 29, 1905, Scriabin wrote, “ The Key to Theosophy  [by Helena Blavatsky] is a wonderful book. You will be amazed how close it is to my thought” ( Scriabin 1965 , 369). Scriabin’s brother-in-law, Boris de Schloezer, described how avidly Scriabin read Blavatsky’s  The Secret Doctrine , marking significant passages in pencil ( 1987 [1923] , 72).  Return to text21.  Like Hesiod, Blavatsky believed the modern human “race” had reached the fifth stage of development, and she predicted two future stages. In this context, “race” refers not to ethnic/cultural/physiognomic difference but rather a class of (mythic) being. For example, Blavatsky’s Root Race I consisted of disembodied and mindless spiritual shadows, while Root Race III was comprised of giants, human-animal hybrids, and divine hermaphrodites.  Return to text22.  When Boris de Schloezer visited Scriabin in Switzerland in 1907, he found the composer “deeply engaged in reading works by Mme. Blavatsky, Annie Besant, C. W. Leadbeater, and other theosophists. His conversation was full of theosophical allusions to Manvantara, Pralaya, Seven Planes, Seven Races, and the like; he used these terms volubly as if they were familiar to all and as if they reflected incontrovertible truths” ( Schloezer 1987 [1923] , 67). Return to text23.  The yellow Color Stage V begins in measures 309–24 with the rapture episode drawn from measures 115–30. Measures 325–40 contain a varied orchestral rendition of the piano’s solo from measures 131–38. In measures 370–90, Scriabin brings back the opening dialogue between piano and orchestra from measures 27–47, and then reprises the “trés anime” episode from measures 67–80 in measures 391–404. Return to text24.  Scriabin’s engagement with the mystic phase of Russian Symbolism dates from at least 1909. During the composition of  Prometheus , Scriabin read essays by Viacheslav Ivanov collected in  By the Stars  ( Ivanov 1909 ). Ivanov’s essays “Presentiments and Portents: The New Organic Era and the Theater of the Future” and “Wagner and the Dionysian Rite” help contextualize aspects of Scriabin’s creative ambitions.

MacDonald ( 1978 ) describes two performances that omitted the slow  luce : one by the Dutch Residentie Orkest, conducted by Michael Gielen on March 24, 1973; another by the Oxford University Orchestra, conducted by MacDonald himself on June 22, 1979.

In a live performance, the viewer has the freedom to choose what he or she looks at in real time. In a visual recording the editor has already made many of these decisions. In each of the recordings discussed, the visual continuity of the light part is broken by cuts to performer close-ups. Return to text27.  While they did not fully realize the colors of the  luce , the producers of the Tokyo NHK Orchestra did have access to the Parisian score, and their effects are quite spectacular.  Return to text28.  The first public lighted performance of  Prometheus  used a projection machine designed by Edison Testing Laboratories. Lights were mounted on a rotating belt equipped with mirrors which enabled the colors to be projected onto layers of gauze sheets hung behind the orchestra ( Plummer 1915 ,  Baker 2002 ). This innovation still restricted the lights to a relatively small area upstage, falling short of Scriabin’s desire to fill the hall with fire. Even today, some modern productions project lights on a screen, drawing upon this relatively inexpensive and practical precedent.  Return to text29.

For the slow  luce , we pre-wrote cues controlled by a light board. The fast  luce  installation was connected to a midi keyboard played by a musician who sat among other members of the orchestra. Return to text31.  Our experience with our  luce  thus somewhat paralleled Scriabin’s own. The instrument did not perform according to our imagined ideal, and so we had to modify our plan to fit our circumstances. Such an experience is intrinsic to the act of performance, and, we might argue, central to the creative aesthetics of  Prometheus  itself. Return to text32.  A performance by the Berlin Philharmonic (1992) belongs to this tradition. Some brightening and dimming occurred as the lights shifted from one area of the concert hall to the next, but in general, dynamics and effects were minimal.  Return to text33.  For example, Fields ( 1969 ) wrote, “I must confess that I could see little connection between the lights and the music. It was fun to watch the lights blink on and off, but the intended higher level of experience escaped me. The fault, of course, may lie more in Scriabin’s conception than in this or any execution of the work. It was difficult, moreover, to focus attention on the orchestra’s contribution, for the novelty of the light show distracted from the music.” Return to text34.  For example, in a 2011 New York Times review of “Spectral Scriabin,” a lighted piano recital, Anthony Tomassini wrote, “Ms. Tipton’s designs here were fairly tame . . . for most of the performance the lighting effects were quite simple: circles of pale, overlapping colors projected on a screen behind the pianist and on the floor around the piano. Maybe Ms. Tipton knew what she was up to. Without too much intrusion from lighting designs, the focus remained on the music” ( Tommasini 2011 ).  Return to text35.  Blavatsky described  Akâsa  and related forces as a kind of “Life-Electricity” ( 1888 , vol. 1, 15; vol. 2, 250), endowing the current running through Scriabin’s  luce  with an extra layer of mystical significance. Dimova ( 2009 ) investigates the way Scriabin’s use of electricity may have resonated with metaphors of light and energy in Symbolist literature. Return to textShorter versions of this article were presented at Music Theory Midwest in Oxford Ohio (2010) and the Society for Music Theory Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (2010). The authors wish to thank Seth Monahan, Kathryn Graber, and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions regarding earlier drafts.For example, Jennifer Tipton, the designer of a 2010 lighted piano recital of Scriabin’s music entitled “Spectral Scriabin,” made a point to distance her work from Scriabin’s vision:  http://www.theworld.org/2010/10/alexander-scriabin/ . And although the kinetic artist Norman Perryman claimed to be channeling various Scriabinesque ideas as he painted during a 2010 performance of the  Poem of Ecstasy , his performance only loosely engaged Scriabin’s ideas regarding color and music. ( See the YouTube performance here. ) Scriabin did not include a multimedia component in the piano music or the  Poem of Ecstasy , so there are no explicit directions for designers to either follow or reject. But designers take similar liberties with  Prometheus , which did include a part for colored lights; see section IV.A selection of these sources includes  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] ,  1911a ,  1911b ,  1929 ; and  Myers 1914–15 .Performative impossibility as an aesthetic value in Scriabin’s music has been explored by Taruskin ( 1997 ), and Morrison ( 1998  and  2002 ).A brief history of lighted performances of  Prometheus  can be found in  Galeev and Vanechkina 2010 , and  Vanechkina 2012 .Scriabin 1911/1913 , archived under the Bibliothèque Nationale catalogue number Res. Vma 228. The score has been described by a number of scholars, including Lobanova ( 2004 ), Dillon ( 2002 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [2000] ), MacDonald ( 1983 ), Horst-Lederer ( 1980 ).For example, as of 11/1/11, the Wikipedia entry on “clavier à lumières” contained numerous inaccuracies and contradictions ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tastiera_per_luce ). It stated that a table correlating pitch and color according to Scriabin’s “synesthetic system” “appears in the [published] score.” Scriabin was not a synesthete as we have come to define the term today, and no such table appeared in the first edition score. Wikipedia then provides a list of colors mapped to pitch classes arranged as an ascending chromatic scale. Not only does a chromatic arrangement represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the premise behind Scriabin’s system, but some of Wikipedia’s tone-color assignments differ significantly from those appearing in the Parisian score manuscript. Wikipedia also states, “the ‘luce’ part is notated . . . [as] two parts, one proceeding on the circle of fifths and the other following the tonal centre of the music.” Neither statement is accurate. Baker 2002 , 73–78;  Galeev and Vanechkina 2001 , 357–61; and  Dillon 2002 , 2–25. When the notation is realized, the lights project colors corresponding to the notated pitches, not sounds.The orthography of Example 5 follows that of  Sabaneev 1911b , 289. This article and its famous presentation of the mystic collection as stacked fourths became available to western analysts in  Sabaneev 1974 [1912] . Scriabin’s sketches for  Prometheus  reveal that he experimented with mystic chord arrangements in stacked thirds and stacked fourths. In both, the fundamental of the collection remains the same. See  Lobanova 2002 , 7–8 and  Eberle 1978 , 64.Sabaneev revealed the relationship between the fast  luce  harmonies and the mystic chord fundamental in his memoir. Scriabin explained, “it is but very simple. You see, I have two lines of color flowing throughout the whole Poem. The first [faster-moving line] corresponds to the music, the harmonies, and therefore often the fundamental bass” ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 262). This relationship has long been acknowledged by scholars, including Gleich ( 1963 ), Vanechkina ( 2012 [1977] ), Eberle ( 1978 ), Pople ( 1989 ), Sabbagh ( 2001 ), and Lobanova ( 2002 ). Dillon ( 2002 , 29–74) explores this relationship in great detail. His mystic-chord analysis of the entire composition confirms that the fast luce part matches the fundamental bass of the mystic chords with few exceptions, and nearly all those exceptions could be interpreted as errors.By extension, the sustained B♮ in the upper strings throughout measures 1–12 would also need to be explained as a non-collectional tone.Perle ( 1984 , 109–110; 117–18) argued for 8-28, then for 9-10; Pople ( 1989 , 133–36) carefully considered both 9-10 and 10-4 before coming down in favor of 9-10; Cheong ( 1990 , 125–39) swept all three aside to claim 9-12 as the basis for op. 67 no.1; Lehrdahl ( 2004 , 321–33) concluded that op. 67 no. 1 was “essentially octatonic with whole-tone and mystic offshoots”; Kallis ( 2008 , 1.8; 3.16–17) summarizes the merits of previous arguments before supporting a 9-10 interpretation.Perle ( 1984 ) and Cheong ( 1993  and  1996 ) have established the importance of orthography in Scriabin’s music. This has not necessarily inhibited an actual understanding of the relationship between the fast  luce  part and the harmonies. In his set-theory analysis of  Prometheus , Baker wrote, “an element of each 6-34 is nearly always represented in the color organ. This pitch class is almost invariably the third element in the normal-order form.” Although Baker insisted that “we need not accept superposed fourths as the basic form of the chord,” he acknowledged that fourth-stacking resulted in a correlation between mystic chord root and the pitches of the slow  luce  ( Baker 1986 , 258–59).Scriabin’s compositional protégé, Nicolai Roslavets, used a similar approach to tonal organization. Bazayev ( 2009 ) investigates how Roslavets generated arrays of orthographically-distinctive pitches by transposing his synthetic scales through a fifth-series.Lerhdahl ( 1988 ) identifies a gap between what he calls compositional grammar and listening grammar in serialism. See also empirical study by Krumhansl, Sandell, and Sergeant ( 1987 ). Tymoczko ( 2011 , 24–25) presents some similar arguments regarding tonal music.Other colors interrupt the whole-tone progression of the slow  luce  part in several places. The sustained B♭ (metallic leaden grey) gives way to B♮ (blue) and C (plain red) within measures 149-68. Additionally, a brief tri-color break in measures 305–9 of D♭ (violet), F (dark red) and A (grass green) separates the slow  luce  progression from C to D. Finally, the printed score contains an E♯ in bar 469, chromatically passing between E (blue-green) and F♯ (dark blue-violet); however, Scriabin crossed this E♯ out in the Parisian score. Scholars have advanced various explanations for these breaks; see Pople  1989 , 244–47 and Dillon  2002 , 60–74. Pople ( 1989 , 234–43) identifies only four passages of literal repetition: i) measures 26–46; ii) measures 67–82; iii) measures 115–30; and iv) measures 130–45. In the latter half of the piece, the third segment (iii) returns first at measures 309–24, followed by segment (i) at 370–90, then (ii) and (iv) at measures 391–406 and 467–507 respectively. The longest of these sections is only twenty measures, a relatively small proportion of a composition over six hundred measures long.Scriabin’s interest in Blavatsky’s writings and other theosophical sources is well-documented. In a letter to his common-law wife Tatiana Schloezer dated April 29, 1905, Scriabin wrote, “ The Key to Theosophy  [by Helena Blavatsky] is a wonderful book. You will be amazed how close it is to my thought” ( Scriabin 1965 , 369). Scriabin’s brother-in-law, Boris de Schloezer, described how avidly Scriabin read Blavatsky’s  The Secret Doctrine , marking significant passages in pencil ( 1987 [1923] , 72). Like Hesiod, Blavatsky believed the modern human “race” had reached the fifth stage of development, and she predicted two future stages. In this context, “race” refers not to ethnic/cultural/physiognomic difference but rather a class of (mythic) being. For example, Blavatsky’s Root Race I consisted of disembodied and mindless spiritual shadows, while Root Race III was comprised of giants, human-animal hybrids, and divine hermaphrodites. When Boris de Schloezer visited Scriabin in Switzerland in 1907, he found the composer “deeply engaged in reading works by Mme. Blavatsky, Annie Besant, C. W. Leadbeater, and other theosophists. His conversation was full of theosophical allusions to Manvantara, Pralaya, Seven Planes, Seven Races, and the like; he used these terms volubly as if they were familiar to all and as if they reflected incontrovertible truths” ( Schloezer 1987 [1923] , 67).The yellow Color Stage V begins in measures 309–24 with the rapture episode drawn from measures 115–30. Measures 325–40 contain a varied orchestral rendition of the piano’s solo from measures 131–38. In measures 370–90, Scriabin brings back the opening dialogue between piano and orchestra from measures 27–47, and then reprises the “trés anime” episode from measures 67–80 in measures 391–404.Scriabin’s engagement with the mystic phase of Russian Symbolism dates from at least 1909. During the composition of  Prometheus , Scriabin read essays by Viacheslav Ivanov collected in  By the Stars  ( Ivanov 1909 ). Ivanov’s essays “Presentiments and Portents: The New Organic Era and the Theater of the Future” and “Wagner and the Dionysian Rite” help contextualize aspects of Scriabin’s creative ambitions. See  Morrison 1998 .MacDonald ( 1978 ) describes two performances that omitted the slow  luce : one by the Dutch Residentie Orkest, conducted by Michael Gielen on March 24, 1973; another by the Oxford University Orchestra, conducted by MacDonald himself on June 22, 1979.Of course, no visual recording could possibly capture a viewer’s experience of a live performance.

Wikipedia then provides a list of colors mapped to pitch classes arranged as an ascending chromatic scale. Not only does a chromatic arrangement represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the premise behind Scriabin’s system, but some of Wikipedia’s tone-color assignments differ significantly from those appearing in the Parisian score manuscript.

At the same time, it has raised questions regarding the relative status of music and lights within the work as a whole. According to \nNicholas Cook, Scriabin’s use of musical symbols “subordinates colour to musical principles” ( 1998 , 37), but one could just as easily imagine that Scriabin’s notational specificity for both was an attempt to equalize the status of music and color. In other words, Scriabin’s detailed lighting score transforms an element typically regarded as incidental into an essential part of the conceptual whole.",

Both projects would involve the coordinated stimulation of multiple senses. While Scriabin contemplated ways to arouse all five senses in the Mysterium , he conceived Prometheus as a more limited experiment focused on the interaction between sight and sound ( Schloezer 1987 [1923] , 254–58).

Scriabin’s private experiments with the luce left favorable impressions with his friend and biographer Leonid Sabaneev, but Scriabin ultimately decided to withdraw the instrument from the public premiere due to unspecified “technical difficulties” ( Sabaneev 1974 [1912] , 131).

This document, known as the Parisian score, contains the only table of color-tone correspondences known to come directly from the composer. Scriabin’s other annotations indicate a level of spectacle far beyond the capacity of Mozer’s luce . He calls for dynamic changes of light intensity and fantastic special effects such as tongues of flame, lighting, fireworks, and sparks. The precise coordination of music and effects indicated by the Parisian score would have been impossible to achieve in 1913.

One hundred years ago, “synesthesia” could refer to a broad range of cross-sensory phenomena, regardless of whether such mappings arose through neurological, psychological, pathological, artistic, intellectual, spiritual, or mystic means ( Dann 1998 ). These changing definitions have led to controversy over the nature of Scriabin’s colored hearing. (8) While the majority of the concert-going public now assume Scriabin’s synesthesia was neurological in origin, Sabaneev indicated that Scriabin deliberately constructed his system of tone-color correspondence for its artistic and spiritual effects ( Sabaneev 1929 , 267n1).

In scholarship, this myth has contributed to a lack of curiosity regarding the full extent of Scriabin’s color-correspondence system. Just as the Parisian score revealed the luce part in Prometheus to be far more than color alone, Scriabin’s carefully worked-out scheme turns out to be far more analytically interesting than the spontaneous mappings typical of neurological synesthetes.

In a later article, Sabaneev described how Scriabin devised his system: I know that originally he recognized clearly no more than three colors—red, yellow, and blue, corresponding to C, D, and F-sharp respectively. The others he deduced rationally, as it were, starting from the assumption that related keys correspond to related colors; that in the realm of color the closest relationship coincides with proximity in the spectrum; and that as regards tonalities it is connected with the circle of fifths.

But when paired with a dramatic color shift in the slow luce , these recurrences of the first theme take on a heightened importance. In this way, the slow luce becomes a visual guide to the large-scale divisions of the work, just as the fast luce clarifies the harmonic rhythm.",

Publicity surrounding early performances of Prometheus explicitly encouraged audiences to interpret Scriabin’s work in light of the theosophical writings of Helena Blavatsky ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 100; Newmarch 1914 ). (20) In her magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine (1888), Blavatsky used the Greek myth of Prometheus to illustrate the false duality between good and evil, a cornerstone of theosophical doctrine. Blavatsky associated the semi-divine Titan who was tortured in punishment for bequest of fire to humankind with Jesus, the Christian “Light of the world,” a son of God who also suffered for humankind’s benefit ( 1888 , vol. 1, 468). But even more emphatically, Blavatsky emphasized the parallels between Prometheus and Lucifer, a fallen angel whose Latin name literally means “light-bearer” (ibid., 462n).",

The fire is light, life, struggle, increase, abundance, thought” (translated in Bowers 1996 , 206–7).

The Secret Doctrine described how the human soul began as an emanation of the divine spirit, a primal thrill of vibration that Blavatsky conceptualized variously as a breath, a sound, and a light. Like a dividing cell, this emanation underwent a process of differentiation over many eons, eventually resulting in a physically embodied being. Although humans had achieved full materialization at the midpoint of the cycle, they still lacked the “sacred spark which burns and expands into the flower of human reason and self-consciousness” ( vol. 2, 95 ). The Promethean enlightenment would eventually allow humans to transcend their base material existence and begin the journey toward divine spiritual reunification. Example 15 .

The second line corresponds to the involution and evolution of the Races. At the beginning is the spiritual, the color blue, then it goes over the other colors to the color red—which is the material, and returns again to blue” ( Sabaneev 2000 [1925] , 262).",

(24) The Symbolist poet Viacheslav Ivanov dwelt upon the potential of the chorus to transcend divisions between performers and spectators, transforming theater into ritual. \nIn a 1909 essay he wrote, “the chorus is in and of itself already a symbol, a sensible signification of the concord and unanimity of sobornost ’, the visible evidence of a real connection that brings isolated consciousness together into a living unity ( Ivanov 2001 , 33).",

In particular, confusion over the function of the slow luce part has sometimes led to a decision to omit it from the performance altogether, (25) to stage it in such a way so that the large-scale changes are obscured, or to freely alter Scriabin’s colors. Example 17 summarizes production information for four different lighted performances of Prometheus available on YouTube. (26) The Berlin Philharmonic (1992) and the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra (2003) blended the fast and slow luce parts, making it difficult to tell which part was changing at any given moment. The Tokyo NHK Orchestra (2006) chose to realize only three colors of the slow luce , reducing Scriabin’s six stages to just three: blue-violet, red, and yellow. (27) Finally, the Russian National Orchestra (2009) undercut the final climactic return of “spiritual” blue-violet in Color Stage VII by lighting the chorus’s entrance with the “material” color of red.

While Mozer’s instrument may have inspired awe in a small chamber, it would lose its dramatic impact in a large concert hall unless it was equipped with a projection apparatus. (28) More powerful forms of theatrical lighting were incapable of delivering the precise articulations called for in Scriabin’s score. Tungsten lights were coming into widespread use around the time of Prometheus ’s premiere, and would have had the capacity to light a wider area (Schroeder 1923, 86–89). However, some of Scriabin’s rhythms and tempos would have exceeded their response time. Electricity passing through the filament creates both light and heat. The filament dims and cools gradually after the electric current has been turned off. This tiny, yet noticeable fade would blur the articulation of the fast luce at rehearsal 44, where Scriabin’s score calls for flashing colors moving with the quarter note pulse of 184 beats per minute.",

Reorchestration and abbreviation slightly obscures the musical relationship between these two moments, but the piano’s entrance on a yellow D mystic chord in the earlier passage (marked “regal, yellow, bright”) helps connect it to the violin solo in the later yellow Color Stage (compare Video 3 to Video 5 ).

Nietzsche had theorized that the chorus in ancient Greek drama mediated between actors and audience, occupying the interstitial space and performing dual roles as observer and participant in the drama ( Nietzsche 2000 , 62–64). In our staging, we seated the choral members in the audience. When they rose for their first entrance, they enacted the transformation from observer to participant. Part V. Conclusion",

There is long tradition of \na performance, critical reception, and scholarship that assumes the answer is no. Clarence Lucas set the tone in his 1915 review of the New York lighted premiere. He wrote that the lights had “no possible connection to the music,” and “served to divert the senses of the audience from a too concentrated attention on the music” (quoted in Hull 1927 , 227). These sentiments would be repeated by reviewers in the decades to come, and even resurface in modern scholarship. Cook, writing in 1998, claimed that “the luce part literally does add little; for while the slower part has no discernible relationship to what is heard, the faster part simply duplicates information that is already present in the music.” Citing the lack of perceptual interaction between what is seen and heard, Cook concluded, “in a significant sense, Prometheus does not belong to the history of multimedia at all” ( 1998 , 38).",

When Prometheus is performed with lights, it is usually in a concert hall, a space normally reserved for reverent appreciation of the “music itself.” Listeners who are deeply enculturated in traditional modes of classical music listening and who are invested in the idea of musical autonomy want their experience of the music disturbed as little as possible. These listeners tend to be highly educated, and are usually the ones granted authority to review concerts. Lucas revealed his own bias against any form of musical multimedia in his 1915 review: “Scriabin, therefore, succeeded in making his music heard in exactly the same way that operatic music in general is heard—that is, with a divided attention.” Traces of this attitude continue to resurface in reviews today. Shows involving a high degree of spectacle risk the charge of tackiness or distraction, \nwhereas ones with more subtle lighting effects are praised because they allow critics to sit back and focus on the music.

Indeed, what we know about Scriabin is that he wanted his music to disturb, and to do so beyond the usual riot-at-the-theater that greeted other early modernist works.

Scriabin conceived of his Mysterium as an impossible, ritualized Gesamtkunstwerk that would trigger apocalypse through the use of a mythic symbolist libretto, multi-sensory stimulation, and new tonal combinations. Prometheus ’s reference to myth, its meticulous coordination of sound and color, and famous non-triadic harmonic structures encourage us to view it as a proto- Mysterial experiment, a preliminary etude for the ultimate work that would bring about the dematerialization of the world and universal spiritual reunification. Scriabin’s annotations in the Parisian score reveal just how conceptually close Prometheus was to the Mysterium . In Prometheus , Scriabin’s final indications read, “inferno, the whole world engulfed,” “cataclysm, all in fire” ( 1911/1913 , 79). Like the Mysterium , Prometheus was to be no mere sound and light show, but rather something else entirely—a work of art that would change the world as we know it.",

According to The Secret Doctrine , tapping into Akâsa could produce tremendous effects in the real world ( 511–12 ). Speaking for Scriabin, Boris de Scholezer, the composer’s brother in law, explained the composer’s belief in the power of mystic vibration: There is no doubt that if we could make visible all vibrations of the air mass produced in the vicinity . . . of a performance of Scriabin’s Prometheus —we would find that all objects, including our own bodies, vibrate in such complex rhythms as to induce the disintegration and transformation of matter ( Schloezer 1987 [1923] , 240–41).",

But if Prometheus is doomed to fail given one set of mystic symbolist aspirations, it can succeed according to another. Scriabin’s friend, the poet Viacheslav Ivanov, described symbolism as “an art that turns the perceiver into a participant in the creative act”; true artworks arise from a mutual collaboration between an artist and audience ( Ivanov 2001 , 51). In Prometheus , Scriabin’s generations of realizers can become his ideal receivers, collaborating with him across the decades to produce more and more spectacular versions of his impossible work. Prometheus embeds a particularly modernist paradox: it was a vision of the future, so only in the future can an “authentic” production be realized—a statement perhaps as true today as it was a century ago.",
