    "abstract": "This article is in response to and in broad support of Philip Ewell’s keynote talk, “Music Theory’s White Racial Frame,” given at the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Society for Music Theory, and essay, “Music Theory and the White Racial Frame” (2020a). In his address and its companion essay, Ewell notes how the repertoire we study and teach, as well as the theories we use to explain it, are manifestations of whiteness. My article will show, first, that the repertory used in the development of theories of harmony and form, as well as (and especially) music theory pedagogy comprises a small, unrepresentative corpus of pieces from the so-called “common practice period” of tonal music, mostly the music of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and only a small subset of their output. We (mis)use this repertory due to a combination ofimplicit biasesthat stem from our enculturation as practicing musicians,explicit biasesthat stem from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of “great” composers and particular “masterworks,” andconfirmation biasesthat are manifest in our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when developing and demonstrating our theories. The theories of harmony and form developed from this small corpus further suffer fromoverfitting, whereby theoretical models are overdetermined relative to the broader norms of a musical practice, and from our tendency to conceive of our theoretic models in terms of tightly regulated “scripts” rather than looser “plans.” For these reasons, simply expanding our analytic and/or pedagogical canon will do little to displace the underlying aesthetic and cultural values that are bound up with it. We must also address the biases that underlie canon formation and valuation and the methodologies that inherently privilege certain pieces, composers, and repertoires to the detriment of others. It is thus argued that working toward greater equity, diversity, and inclusion in music theory goes hand in hand with addressing some of the problematic methodologies that have long plagued our discipline.",

This is critical because the WAM canon carries with it a host of assumptions and presumptions regarding race, gender, and class that shape how we think and talk about music in ways both large and small. Second, Professor Ewell called for greater inclusivity in terms of “who gets to be a music theorist” with regard to undergraduate and graduate theory programs as well as entry-level employment opportunities.

Paula Maust’s website Expanding the Music Theory Canon ( 2021 ) is dedicated to teaching examples by BIPOC and women composers, and Ewell himself is at work on a new undergraduate theory textbook ( Ewell et al. 2023 ). The need for inclusion is particularly acute; as Ewell points out in his 2020 MTO article, only 1.67% of the musical examples in the seven most commonly used music theory textbooks in the USA are by non-white composers ( Ewell 2020a , [3.1]).",

As the WAM tradition is overwhelmingly white and male, adding a relatively small number of works by women and BIPOC composers runs the risk of tokenism. Ewell notes: This distinction between “white repertoire” and “white theory” is of vital importance insofar as our white racial frame can only envision one (expanding the repertoire) and not the other (studying nonwestern music theory). This relates to the distinction between “diversity” and “antiracism” that I made above. To “diversify” our repertoire by adding a few POC composers actually reinforces our white frame. ( 2020a , [3.4]) In other words, if these “diversity examples” are only added as alternative illustrations of harmonic patterns, formal archetypes, and contrapuntal schemas derived from the white, male majority practice, they will do little to change what we listen to, and more importantly, how we think about what we listen to.",

                "text": "[1.5] Music theory is largely an inductive practice, based upon a very small number of privileged examples from which more general principles of harmony, phrase structure, rhythm, and form are derived. Moreover, the use of this set of examples, cherry-picked from a “common practice period” (hereafter “CPP,” roughly 1700–1900), privileges certain parameters such as melody, rhythm, and (especially) harmony over others like timbre and texture. This approach to theory and analysis is highly problematic in and of itself, for it leads to theories of musical structure which are necessarily incomplete, which in turn warps our analytic practice. The problem may be diagnosed as follows: Music theory of the common practice era (i.e., theories of harmony, melody, rhythm, and form) proceeds inductively from a small, unrepresentative corpus of examples, mostly the music of Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and only a small subset of their output. We routinely fail to acknowledge the various biases that underlie the construction of this corpus, including implicit biases that come from our active enculturation as practicing musicians, explicit biases that stem from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of “great” composers and particular “masterworks”, and confirmation biases that are reinforced by our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when developing and demonstrating our theories. Compounding the issue noted in the first point, we often position singular pieces as privileged exemplars that serve as the model for a structural type (the “Beethoven Op. 2/1 problem,” as pointed out by BaileyShea 2004 ). Our theorizing from a small set of samples consistently leads to overfitting , whereby theoretical models are overdetermined relative to the broader norms of a musical practice. Moreover, these overfitted models are couched in terms of tightly regulated “scripts” rather than looser “plans” for the organization of musical structure, most especially in the context of theories of musical form ( Schank and Abelson 1977 ).",

Moreover, simply adding a few more examples of rondo form or parallel period phrase structure by non-white, non-male composers will not displace the music-theoretic presumptions and norms stemming from music theory’s white racial frame, but, as noted in the quotation from Ewell above, will reinforce it. Thus, Ewell’s wake-up call for music theory to assess its whiteness, and its role in promoting that whiteness, is not only an opportunity for us to work toward greater equity, diversity, and inclusion, but also to address some problematic methodologies that have long plagued the discipline. Indeed, one cannot do the former without doing the latter.",

A number of recent studies, importantly, have pointed out the problems in both the development and implementation of FRT. As Bacchini and Lorusso note: Face recognition technology, as it is produced, implemented and used in Western societies, reinforces existing racial disparities in stop, investigation, arrest and incarceration rates because of racist prejudices and even contributes to strengthen the unhealthy effects of racism on historically disadvantaged racial groups, like black people. ( 2019 , 321) Likewise, Buolamwini and Gebru have shown that for many of the widely used FRT systems: Darker-skinned females are the most mis-classified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.

B. Marx, Hugo Riemann, and Heinrich Schenker established the tenets of formal, harmonic, and contrapuntal analysis that are still in use today. Their theories were based upon and illustrated with music from a small sample of German-speaking composers, most especially Beethoven. Their core analytic repertoire is also still with us today—manifesting most obviously in the continued study of Schenkerian analysis, but also in recent and influential work on harmony, voice leading, and small- and large-scale form.

First, there is its relatively small size. Schenker’s published works include discussions of 40 pieces/examples ( Ayotte 2004 ), Caplin’s book has 288 examples, and Hepokoski and Darcy’s volume has 552 examples. While Caplin’s and Hepokoski and Darcy’s repertoires seem to be big, note that other music data sets are much larger. Daniel Harasim’s website ( https://github.com/dharasim/MCR/wiki ) contains a list of corpora for music analysis in a range of formats, and includes both symbolic encodings (e.g., text, MusicXML, KERN, MIDI) and real audio. Harasim’s site lists 42 corpora, of which 14 are compilations of pop, jazz, or folksongs (including both Western and non-Western folksongs), and 28 are collections of “classical” music, which ranges from monophonic chant to row forms in Schoenberg. Some of these corpora are modest in size—several hundred pieces or score excerpts—but others are extensive: The Yale-Classical Archives Corpus includes 8,980 pieces/movements from 1548 to the mid-20th century, providing over 12 million chords for harmonic sequence analysis ( https://ycac.yale.edu/downloads ). The Meerens Tune Collection (MTC-FS-INST-2.0) contains 18,618 pieces of instrumental and vocal Dutch folk music ( http://www.liederenbank.nl/mtc/ ). The Essen collection of European folksongs presently contains over 20,000 songs and instrumental melodies ( http://esac-data.org/ ). The Million Song Dataset is a product of the Echo Nest corporation ( the.echonest.com ), a subsidiary of Spotify, which, as its name suggests, contains metadata and access to audio for one million pop songs ( http://millionsongdataset.com ).",

Worse, perhaps, than the small size is that these samples are mostly comprised of the works of four composers: J. S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and (of course) Beethoven (henceforth “BHMB”). These four composers represent 62.5% of Schenker’s published analyses ( Ayotte 2004 ) and 69.4% of the pieces mentioned in Hepokoski and Darcy’s book; note the percentage for the latter jumps to 96.3% when we consider only the musical examples. All of the examples in Caplin’s book are from Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, as for him—note his title—these three composers represent the “core repertory of the high Viennese classical style” ( 1998 , 3; see also p. 52). (2) We thus should be honest, and note that when we say “music of the common practice period” we really just mean BHMB, with a few others thrown in, most typically Schubert, Schumann, and Chopin. Markus Neuwirth ( 2013 ) sums up the problem as follows: First, there is the problem of the paucity of examples. The compositional output by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, upon which far too many studies in the field of formal analysis rely, represents only the “tip of the iceberg” of the entire musical output from Vienna between 1770 and 1810, comprising perhaps less than 5% of that repertoire. However, even more critical is the second problem, which concerns the representativeness of the chosen repertoire. This issue arises when the corpus selection is not made on a random basis, but is instead biased by prior value judgments that have determined which composers and works belong to the canon of the “true” masters. Are the formal features found in the works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven representative of Viennese compositional practices as a whole, such that these features occur with about the same frequency in the music of other composers working in Vienna at around the same time?

In his 2013 dissertation, Neuwirth broadens the study of Viennese classical form to include the music of Koželuch, Pleyel, and Clementi, all of whom were contemporaries of and potential influences upon Haydn, and in so doing shows how various “exceptional” aspects of Haydn’s compositional practice were, in fact, commonplace.",

It privileges instrumental music, even though sacred music and opera were the dominant genres of the day. Bach’s cantatas, motets, and passions are largely absent, as are Mozart and Haydn’s masses and operas as well as Beethoven’s songs. Music for wind band (Beethoven), Baryton (Haydn), or organ (Bach) is also given little attention. To be fair, works in the formenlehre tradition like Hepokoski and Darcy ( 2006 ) and Caplin ( 1998 ) will tend to include more instrumental than vocal music, but our myopic fixation on sonata form and a limited assortment of phrase structures causes us to ignore the many other contexts that present other compositional problems and solutions (e.g., the da capo and double aria forms; variations in the brilliant style, potpourris, dramatic recitative, etc.).

Turek’s anthology ( 2007 ), for example, includes a narrow list of CPP composers—wherein the addition of Brahms and Tchaikovsky to the BHMB+ set accounts for 85% of all of the pre-twentieth century examples—leavened with a large list of jazz and musical theater tunes that lean heavily on the Great American Songbook.

This last reason exemplifies the problem of convenience sampling , that is finding data, examples, or subjects that are readily available and/or familiar to the researcher. As Etikan et al. point out: Although commonly used, it is neither purposeful nor strategic. The main assumption associated with convenience sampling is that the members of the target population are homogeneous. That is, that there would be no difference in the research results obtained from a random sample, a nearby sample, a co-operative sample, or a sample gathered in some inaccessible part of the population . . .

Our enshrining of certain pieces as masterworks might be thought of as an explicit bias , an overt and shared cultural preference regarding the status and aesthetic and cultural value of certain works. The institutions of classical music—conservatories, symphonies opera companies and their supporting infrastructure, arts funding agencies, and so on—rarely examine or question this explicit bias. Music theorists by and large are classically-trained musicians, and music theory’s traditional home is in the schools of music and conservatories where such musicians are trained. Entry into most graduate programs in music theory requires a substantial amount of music performance skills (keyboard skills, solfège, compositional ability in various forms of harmony and counterpoint, etc.).

So, most musicians, including those who are music theorists, have an exceptionally high level of exposure (i.e., 10,000 hours) to a very limited range of repertoire. It is not surprising that one might harbor a very positive view of a repertoire that one knows so well and has dedicated so much time and effort to learn. Moreover, becoming a skilled musician—in any style, genre, or culture—carries with it the presumption that the music one has learned is of high cultural value. This is certainly true in the case of Western classical music, which we mark as “art” music, in distinction to “popular” or “vernacular” music. Thus, we have explicit positive biases toward the classical musical canon in general, and in many cases toward the BHMB corpus in particular, as those pieces—and especially the pieces studied in music theory classes—are the mainstays of the concert repertoire, at least for pianists and orchestral string players.",

Implicit bias (or implicit stereotyping) was initially framed by Greenwald and Banaji ( 1995 ) within the context of implicit cognition: “an implicit C is the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) trace of past experience that mediates R. In this template, C is the label for a construct (such as attitude), and R names the category of responses (such as object evaluative judgments) assumed to be influenced by that construct” ( 1995 , 5). Greenwald and Banaji note that attitudes can be favorable or unfavorable dispositions toward people, places, policies, and so forth, and that the responses can be preferences, value judgments, and actions. Greenwald and Banaji also note that “the identifying feature of implicit cognition is that past experience influences judgment in a fashion not introspectively known by the actor” ( 1995 , 4–7).",

The less familiar something is, the less we are inclined to like and/or esteem it. The effect of unfamiliarity on our analytic judgments has been noted by Neuwirth in the way we tend to regard compositions by contemporaries of BHMB whose music is less familiar to us: In the case of Kleinmeister compositions, deviations from what is regarded as the normative model are devalued, as are pieces which [rigidly] conform to that model. It is a no-win situation for the Kleinmeister : whatever option is chosen, the typical reaction of many analysts is either to regard the work in question as a premature manifestation of the full-fledged form, or to assume a failing on the part of the composer rather than specific aesthetic intentions. This suggests that in many cases, analytical judgment is implicitly (or unconsciously) guided by knowledge of the identity of the composer.” ( Neuwirth 2013 , 42) Of course the very term Kleinmeister is pejorative, and—as Neuwirth has pointed out—the “little master” designation itself is a product of implicit bias ( Neuwirth 2011 , fn 31). For the most part, we don’t know the music of BHMB’s contemporaries, so our negative judgments of their work cannot logically be based on familiarity with it. For the most part, the simple reason we don’t value these works is because we don’t know them.",

Consider the following thought experiment: I give you the number sequence “2–4–6,” and I ask you to guess the rule that generates it. To assist in your guessing, you may give me other sequences, and I will tell you if they fit the rule or not. Most people will say “6–8–10” or some other sequence of even numbers, though a few might say “11–13–15,” These responses reflect an inference that the rule is “increasing even numbers” or “add 2 to each number in the sequence;” they are responses that conform to that rule. This thought process is symptomatic of confirmation bias : only choosing test cases that confirm your presupposition, rather than examples/cases that might disconfirm it. Whereas attempts at falsification, on the other hand, would include sequences like “10–8–6” or “7–11–13” (i.e., is it directionality? It is a sequence of a class of numbers? and so forth).",

Thus a sequence like “4–5–6” would have been an appropriate test. This is because it does not correspond to the rule assumed by the participant at this stage and yet it prompts a positive feedback (since it does correspond to the correct rule). Thus, participants’ assumptions about the rule would have been falsified. ( Oswald and Grossjean 2004 , 80). When we test a hypothesis we also evaluate, if only implicitly, the cost of disconfirmation. The cost of disconfirmation in Wason’s number-guessing game is low, but in other contexts it can be much higher. If the cost of disconfirmation is high—for example, if it forces us to find fault with a friend, to abandon a pet theory, or to lower the esteem for composers we have previously valued and whose music we have extensively studied and practiced—then we are more likely to exhibit confirmation bias.",

This may happen in different ways: (a) memories congruent with the hypothesis are more likely to be accessed . . . (b) undue weight is given to the importance of the congruent information . . . and (c) sources with information that could reject the hypothesis are avoided. ( Oswald and Grossjean 2004 , 93) Music theories are motivationally supported by our aesthetic values and encultured beliefs. If we “know” that Beethoven and Mozart are master composers, rather than reject or modify a theory inductively derived from their music, we reject data that run counter to our well-established biases. Again, Neuwirth’s comments on how we regard the work of Kleinmestern continue to register as unsurprising. In a similar vein, it is noteworthy that in Hepokoski and Darcy’s theory of sonata form, there are only three (out of 80) musical examples that are not by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and that these three examples (by J. C. Bach, Scarlatti, and C. P. E. Bach) appear in the chapters on variant sonata forms, especially the “problematic,” Type 2 classification (Scarlatti and C. P. E. Bach).",

It is then like a finished sonnet or a painting completed. One hates to disturb it. Even if subsequent information should shoot a hole in it, one hates to tear it down because it once was beautiful and whole . . . The things of our minds have for us a greater toughness than external reality . . . These mind things are very strong; in some, so strong as to blot out the external things completely. ( Steinbeck and Ricketts 1941 , 180–181) Thus in music theory we all too often fail to acknowledge the various biases that lead to the construction of our analytic and teaching corpora. This includes implicit biases that come from our active enculturation as practicing musicians, explicit biases from broadly held aesthetic beliefs regarding the status of “great” composers and “masterworks,” and confirmation biases that are reinforced by our tendency to use only positive testing strategies and/or selective sampling when putting our theories in practice. 4.

Most forms are not defined by a single locus classicus; no one piece serves as the ultimate paradigm of sonata form, no single phrase represents the virtual embodiment of the period. When it comes to the sentence, however, one example is consistently privileged above all others: Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in F Minor, op. 2, no. 1, first movement, bars 1–8. ( BaileyShea 2004 , 5)",

It is excellent “one-stop shopping” for many attributes of the sentence: a 2+2+4 grouping structure, a relatively low degree of closure in bar 4, and so forth. But as BaileyShea also notes, using Beethoven’s theme as an ideal type masks the wider range of sentence forms, many of which he catalogs in his article. This leads BaileyShea to ask, “at what point do listeners begin to hear a passage as ‘sentential,’ and what do they expect to happen in such a passage?” ( 2004 , 21). He goes on to say: Because these types of repetition are ubiquitous in Western music, an extraordinarily large number of passages would elicit sentence expectations without producing normative continuations. In order to hear a specific passage as a “failed sentence” or “failed continuation” then, we need to separate those types of repetition that initiate sentential expectations from those that do not. Creating a theory that would account for such a distinction, however, is nearly impossible . . . [for] any passage that begins with the statement of a brief musical idea and some form of repetition would immediately fall under the category of “sentence. ( BaileyShea 2004 , p. 22) The real problem here, which follows from our fondness for exemplars and prototypes, is that Schoenberg, et al., treat the sentence form as a narrow script . It is more properly regarded as a plan , that is, as a constellation of more general and basic constraints on how melodies can unfold when they begin with the repetition of a basic idea.",

They use the example of ordering a meal from a menu to illustrate some of the essential features of scripts and scripted behaviors. As such: A script is a structure that describes appropriate sequences of events in a particular context. is made up of slots and requirements as to what can fill those slots. handles stylized everyday situations. is not subject to much change, nor does it provide the apparatus for handling totally novel situations.

But no explaining away is necessary if one regards the sentence as a more general plan that involves options for repetition, continuation, and closure. To put it in Caplin’s terms, the sentence is an essentially “loose” form, with a range of options for its unfolding ( Caplin 1998 , 255; see also BaileyShea 2004 , 10–11). In expressly framing it in this manner, Caplin presents the sentence as a type of plan as opposed to a script. More broadly, while scripts, according to Schank and Abelson, can be executed in different ways (“slots and requirements as to what can fill those slots”), the use of privileged exemplars leads to two outcomes, both undesirable.

This view of form sounds very much like a plan, rather than a script. In line with this, at various points Hepokoski and Darcy properly note that sonata form is a flexible framework for the organization of musical ideas: they recommend that readers remain “cautious in reconstructing the internal anatomy and details of the formal aspects of musical genres . . . Far from being rigidly prescriptive, genres, properly construed, provide for a flexible set of options at any given point in the realization of any individual exemplar” ( 2006 , 608).

Those norms are the result of a long music-theoretic tradition of overfitting to small sets of privileged data points, which include the BHMB canon and subsets thereof (e.g., Hepokoski and Darcy’s “Type 5 Sonata” is essentially derived from Mozart’s concertos). As noted above, the only non BHMB musical examples in their sizable book are examples of variants and/or deformations. Second, they claim—based on a belief that one composes and listens “dialogically” relative to the norms of compositional practice—that one of the goals of their project is to enable modern listeners to be able to hear and appreciate those dialogs ( 2006 , 9–13 and 603–610). However, as the quote above from Neuwirth ( 2013 ) points out, they have not done the analytical surveying required to establish what those norms are. Third and most significantly, they frame their elaborate taxonomy of sonata form types, subtypes, defaults (on multiple levels), and so forth as script-like, post hoc ergo propter hoc reifications of specific choices that Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven made. They do so in the context of the rotational forms that all fall under the umbrella term “sonata form.”",

Critically, we neglected to emphasize the problems of diversity, equity, and inclusion that come with hewing to the traditional teaching repertoire. We should have. Poundie and Peter’s arguments affirmed the high artistic value of the music of the BHMB canon and our collective duty to preserve and present that canon to our students; its presumed ubiquity and familiarity; and, pragmatically, that we have well-developed tools for teaching and analyzing it. In the end, the large audience of music theorists in attendance agreed with them; Heather and I lost the debate.",

That is true, but for most musicians, and certainly for most of the public, music theory is what we teach in the undergraduate classroom. As the 2011 debate demonstrated, we are very reluctant to move away from that core pedagogy. I think this is due, perhaps in large part, to the constellation of biases, implicit and explicit, that prevents us from considering alternative pedagogical repertoires, topics, and approaches (though see VanHandel 2020 for various ideas on how we might do so). There is also the problem of habit: we continue to teach this repertoire and the concepts derived from it “because we’ve always done it this way,” even though we know there are other repertoires and approaches that can serve us well in teaching our students how harmony, melody, rhythm, and form work.",

But we must be clear eyed about how and why we inherited the BHMB canon from our music-theory forebears, and about the overt and covert values and biases that support our continued use and valuation of it. I hope readers of this essay will also acknowledge that many of our core concepts in music theory—from “metrical accent” and “harmonic dissonance” to “recapitulation” and “developing variation”—come from our deep engagement with the BHMB canon and the canon of theory literature that has emerged. While we can develop alternative approaches to functional harmony in popular music, or different modes of development in minimalism, or different theories of metrical accent to account for the rhythmic structure of Balkan and Sub-Saharan African musics, we must recognize the biases and conceptual baggage we carry with us when do so. We must be aware of these biases to the fullest extent possible, especially when we rely on our “analytic intuitions.” For far too often, intuition is simply prejudice by another name.",

The methodological potholes that we have fallen into in our study of WAM from 1700–1900 can all too easily be replicated in our study of other musics, whether jazz, blues, pop, or world music.",

It was also a wake-up call for us all to be better music theorists. Indeed, we cannot do the former if we do not do the latter.",
