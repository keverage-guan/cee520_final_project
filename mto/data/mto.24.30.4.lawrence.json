This volume, on the other hand, focuses on “examin[ing] the role musical structures play in conveying aspects of drama” (2). “Structures,” in this case, is not shorthand for form, although that is one of many parameters discussed in the volume. Indeed, one of the volume’s strengths is the staggering diversity of the contributions: a diversity of repertoire (the major case studies span the 1950s through 2010s, and there are further musical examples stretching back to the 1920s); musical parameters (including harmony, rhyme, rhythm, tonality, and topicality); and methodological orientation (including intertextuality, literary criticism, queer studies, and temporality).

In general, this volume’s more successful chapters manage to use customary tools constructively by tweaking them adroitly to fit the needs of the repertoire. Others, however, have a tendency to apply existing theoretical concepts uncritically to this new repertoire, sometimes resulting in questionable analytical results.",

                "text": "[1.1] Here for the Hearing opens with one of its strongest entries, Nathan Beary Blustein’s “‘Was It Ever Real?’: Tonic Return via Stepwise Modulation in Broadway Songs.” The chapter’s basic premise is quite simple. In most Broadway songs, the final modulation (usually up a half or whole step) is an act of tonal departure that closes the song in a new, higher, more energized key. But some songs traverse circular paths, such that the final upward modulation enacts a tonic return , restoring the original key. Blustein examines a variety of such songs to show how an ascent back to tonic “expands a song’s rhetorical potential” (11).",

A second is songs that descend by step for the bridge and then ascend by step for the final chorus, but do this via indirect modulations. A third is songs that modulate to tonic somewhere other than the final chorus. (I will address the fourth in paragraph [1.4].) What makes this chapter so effective is that it never becomes a mere catalogue of these songs and their techniques. In his analyses, Blustein not only attends to the unique musical features of each song; he also finds a way to turn their tonal trajectories into metaphors for the characters’ psychology.",

Blustein suggests that achieving this traditional goal via an unusual modulation shows that the old formal conventions of the rag can be sustained only through new sorts of modulations, the kind of changes that unnerve the character Father. “The Wizard and I” features a thematic return before the tonic return (the chorus starts in B, but is wrenched into C partway through). This extra effort to return the music to C mid-chorus becomes an illustration of Elphaba’s “determination to overcome her obstacles” (12). The final chorus of “So Much Better” begins with a double return but then continues to modulate further. This manic upward modulation reflects Elle’s racing thoughts and “unbounded excitement” (13).",

Although most of the volume’s other contributors are careful not to ascribe too much to the composer (and thus often resort to speaking only about the musical works’ properties, and not about who created them), Blustein, Drew Nobile, and J. Daniel Jenkins are the only ones who explicitly consider the work of arrangers/orchestrators and actually name some of them: in Blustein’s case, those include arrangers William David Brohn and Alex Lacamoire and orchestrator Stephen Oremus, who worked with Stephen Schwartz on Wicked.",

He states that in songs without extended breaks, “a majority of the melodic, harmonic, and tonal material most likely originated with the composers” (18). This is not a safe assumption. Some musical theater composers supply basically nothing but the tune. (1) For example, that quotation from Blustein comes directly before he analyzes “’Til Him” from Mel Brooks’s The Producers . Brooks wrote every song in that show (not just the ones with extended breaks) by singing melodies into a tape recorder and having Glen Kelly (whom Blustein does not name) transcribe and arrange them ( Brooks 2001 ). Blustein’s baseline acknowledgment of arrangers is a huge and laudatory step in the right direction, but I wish he had mentioned them more consistently, where they were possibly relevant, and that the editors of the volume had advised the other authors to do the same.",

Nobile’s point of departure is Sondheim’s own claim that “harmony is what makes music” while rhythm and melody are “secondary” (36). But, although Steve Swayne ( 2005 ) has identified various classical influences on Sondheim’s harmony, no one has really shown how Sondheim regularly draws upon those twentieth-century classical harmonic influences in his compositional practice. Nobile aims to do precisely that, connecting Sondheim to the “contemporary tonal” vocabulary previously explored by Daniel Harrison ( 2016 ).",

More specifically, he notes that Sondheim’s melodies tend to be diatonic and his bass lines tend to be functional, just embellishing 1 ˆ , 4 ˆ , and 5 ˆ ; when there are dissonances, they tend to be present in what Nobile calls the “chordal zone” in between the bass and the melody. Four characteristic features of Sondheim’s chordal zones are (a) the use of a “five-note tonic” chord, consisting of 1 ˆ , 2 ˆ , 3 ˆ , 5 ˆ , and 6 ˆ ; (b) oscillations between 3 ˆ and 4 ˆ over a tonic pedal; (c) the use of “suspended dominants” that omit the leading tone; and (d) the use of the set class (0148) to derive “colored triads” (Harrison’s term).",

Here, Nobile modifies Stephen Banfield’s suggestion ( Banfield 1993 ) that the act progresses from chromaticism to diatonicism, suggesting instead that the act “[absorbs] [its] signature chromaticism in a diatonic context” (52), to capture dissonance within order rather than erasing it. Nobile’s reading of Into the Woods discusses why so many tonic chords in the musical are thirdless, substituting 4 ˆ for 3 ˆ throughout most of the show. His proposition is that 3 ˆ is added to tonic chords late in the show, at the pivotal moments at which characters learn communal responsibility.",

Yet additionally, within a single topic (the waltz once again), it allows for particularization. In the opening number, “Try to Remember,” “the waltz serves as a signal for nostalgia” (80), its circularity keeping listeners rooted in the past. This nostalgia may seem innocent but is turned into something grotesque in “Round and Round,” in which the circularity becoming a source of exhaustion and preventing the progress of love. The waltz becomes a vehicle for real love only in “They Were You,” when all circularity is shed.",

Later, he lists the main progression of “Try to Remember” as I–I 6 –IV 5–6 –V 7 . (Even if one thinks the chord is IV and not first-inversion ii, it should be IV 6–5 .) Then, he omits all of the sevenths from his Roman-numeral analysis of the descending fifths sequence, even though they could play an interesting role in his reading of this passage as perpetuating a sense of circularity. Despite these quibbles, I think his treatment of its waltzes delivers genuine insights, ones that would not have been as clear without the background of his preceding readings of The Secret Garden and Sweeney Todd . I can imagine this chapter being of use to scholars of many media beyond music theater, as the mixing of generalizing and particularizing strategies could operate just as easily in film, opera, or myriad other genres.

This is unclear, because Plotkin doesn’t engage with (or cite) any prior literature on these concepts, not even the work of Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff ( 1983 ), with whom the term “preference rule” is virtually synonymous in music theory. (2) For Lerdahl and Jackendoff, preference rules kick in when there are multiple grammatically well-formed ways to parse a passage of music: they explain which readings a listener is more likely to select. For Plotkin, the preferences seem to be about aesthetic pleasure: they explain which rhyme schemes a listener is more likely to enjoy. Evidence that this is what Plotkin means appears when he rewrites the lyrics to “Tonight” from West Side Story in ways that violate the preference rules and seem less satisfying (101–2).

First, the concept of “poetic feet” is irrelevant to most musical theater styles, which makes PR-FEET a questionable assumption. (3) Second, PR-DUR comes into such frequent conflict with PR-MEL and PR-FORM that one might wonder why it exists as a rule at all.  PR-DUR entails a baseline assumption that e.g. the fourth bar of an eight-bar phrase will rhyme with the second bar. But eight-bar parallel periods in musical theater songs tend to be rhymed abab . Unless presentations statistically dominate over antecedents in this repertoire by a significant margin, why should a listener automatically prefer the former? A listener can expect that the second musical idea will conclude with a word that is part of the rhyme scheme, but not more than that. Third, PR-FORM clashes with how sentences are customarily rhymed. Plotkin writes that PR-FORM is satisfied “by rhyming the end of two measures of continuation function with the end of the subsequent two measures of cadential function” or “by rhyming the end of a presentation and the end of the subsequent continuation” (98). But in some musical theater styles, the conclusion of a sentence is as likely (or, in the first half of the 20th century, much more likely) to rhyme with the end of the next sentence, not with its own presentation or with the first half of its continuation.

Isn’t long-range form precisely the kind of classical-only idea that is inapplicable to musical theater? Exhibiting a clear awareness of and sensitivity to this issue, Buchler begins by addressing this skepticism head-on. He quotes two musical theater historians arguing that Guys and Dolls is constructed like a “jigsaw puzzle” ( Ewen 1958 , 189, quoted on pg. 146) or has “tonal and structural cohesion rare in the annals of American Musical Theatre” (Bordman 2001, 631, quoted on pg. 146). And he suggests that “long-range form” is of a piece with the mid-twentieth-century musical’s undeniable focus on formal integration. In keeping with this premise, Buchler’s “three notions” are not really about what most classical theorists would think of when they hear the word “form.” They are about (a) character development, (b) the placement and disposition of songs overall, and (c) “the placement and meaning of duets” (146) in particular.

We see how the character Cathy uses genre markers as a coping mechanism and mask for her emotions, and how Jamie’s self-expression becomes more sincere as the musical goes on, as he sheds the genre markers that made his earlier songs parodic. This is a thought-provoking analysis of how style functions in the musical, and it could be assigned fruitfully in a class in combination with Decker’s chapter.",

The chorus depicts Alison’s confidence through its more regular and tight-knit phrase structure, while a bit of metrical dissonance in the bridge highlights Alison’s outsider status as she sings “Why am I the only one who sees you’re . . . ” (220). Lumsden’s reading of “Changing My Major” mentions similar halting rhythms in the verse of the song, but homes in on moments of “slippage.” These include ambiguities in phrase structure in the chorus and ambiguities in the song’s overall key structure.",

It is a good model of how to draw upon easily audible features of meter, form, and harmony and knit them into an easy-to-appreciate and convincing analysis. If it has any flaws, it is that it assumes that we can treat traditional sentence structures as the “heteronormative” formal model that is being queered, when, in fact, we do not know how much normative power the sentence paradigm retains in 2010s musical theater. If the sentence paradigm has grown much weaker, continuing to hold it up as a model allows us to interpret most phrase structures too readily as acts of queer resistance. Lumsden cannot be faulted for this, however. Her analyses are about as good as is possible to produce given currently available tools. We simply need more tools.

He suggests that the relative lack of density in Jefferson’s first verse in “Cabinet Battle #1” is a deliberate ploy by Jefferson to be endearingly plain-spoken.

But this does not explain why, for example, Komaniecki includes a lengthy excerpt from “My Shot” with no annotations (e.g., underlining, italics, etc.) to mark the rhymes (243). Komaniecki’s Figure 10.1, showing wordplay in “Farmer Refuted,” gets the job done, but providing a score excerpt showing Hamilton’s line layered over Seabury’s might have made these points more user-friendly.

The other is Jenkins’s perceptive account of how the genre of the musical theater song poses special problems for theories of parody. While some musical theater songs have what Kurt Mosser ( 2008 ) calls a “base song” (a paradigmatic performance that is the reference point for future covers, parodies, etc.), some do not.

Zbikowski calls those items that are “securely inside the category” Type-1 examples, while those that are “in danger of being excluded” are called Type-2. Consider birds as a category: Type-1 examples would include robins and sparrows, while emus and penguins would be Type-2 examples. (257) This is not how Zbikowski uses those terms, however. Zbikowski’s Type 1 refers to categories that have graded memberships, and Type 2 refers to categories that have necessary and sufficient conditions for membership ( 2002 , 36–41). Thus, emus and penguins are not Type-2 examples, as Jenkins states; rather, they are the least typical members of a Type-1 category (birds). The real issue here is not that the numbering is incorrect; rather, it is that prototype theory is meant to allow one to escape these sorts of crisp categories altogether.",

Even so, his actual analysis of “Send in the Clones” refers to various musical performances (or performance elements) as being, simply, Type-1 or Type-2. The binary categories remain operative. This is a pity, because the core of Jenkins’s analysis is intriguing. He makes the case that the Kinsey Sicks replaced Sondheim’s original musical features with ones borrowed from doo-wop, and that doo-wop is meant to represent the dated heteronormative values reinforced by a certain type of gay men (the title “clones”). A more faithful use of prototype theory—one that tracks the ebb and flow of prototypical elements across the song as a means of establishing a changing relationship with our conceptual models of the song—could have served this reading quite well.

For while there are some cases where all productions of a musical refer back to the original, there are many others where there are multiple competing versions that are canonically enshrined, with no one version epitomizing “the musical itself,” so to speak. Treating such musicals as conceptual models that integrate individual features found across productions is a handy solution.
