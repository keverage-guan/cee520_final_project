    "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the orchestration strategies used in Simon Steen-AndersenDouble Upfor sampler and orchestra. The analysis examines the relation between the 121 samples that make up the work’s electronic soundtrack and the orchestral imitation of these samples. The relation between the concept of the piece and its orchestration is summed up in six strategies: scoring the audio recordings, supplements, additive orchestration, chamber music orchestration, anonymization, and pre-orchestration. These strategies are presented as a qualification of the word “satisfactory” inGrove Music Online’s definition of orchestration as the art of combining instruments “to form a satisfactory blend and balance.” Furthermore,Double Up’s contribution to the use of sampling in orchestral music is evaluated.",

It is, however, by no means an ordinary concerto; there are no concertante elements or virtuosic displays in this music. There is also nothing beautiful or colorful in any traditional sense. It is a kind of anti-orchestral music; in fact, it is doubtful that many people would categorize it as orchestral music only by listening to it. On the other hand, this piece is obviously about the orchestration. The material consists solely of recordings of everyday sounds played by the sampler, combined with orchestral imitations of this material. The orchestra’s imitations balance the playback of samples in such a way that they cannot be distinguished from one another. The orchestra has no material of its own. Composition seems to exist only on a less detailed level—in the selection and organization of the sound files.",

In this article I focus on the strategies for combining the instruments, but also to a lesser extent the use of the instruments themselves. I suggest that the composition is controlled by some pre-compositional tendencies and possibly even principles for combining the instruments. (1) In what follows, I explore how Steen-Andersen creates this unusual orchestral sound by working with a group of particular orchestration strategies. I then show how these strategies fulfill the concept of Double Up , and evaluate Double Up ’s contribution to the use of the sampler in orchestra music. Double Up",

The composer’s fascination with the relations between aural and visual elements is clear, for example, in Next To Beside Besides (2005–2007), where the physical gestures from an earlier piece are used to sculpt new versions of the piece for other instruments (“choreographic translations”), or in Study for String Instrument #3 (2011), where the musician plays a “duet” with a video projection of her- or himself. (2) Although there are no visual elements in Double Up , the work centers on the imitation of sounds from everyday life—sounds with clear visual references. Double Up has achieved a certain amount of success: it has been performed by seven different orchestras, (3) and broadcast by a number of European radio stations (in Germany, Sweden, Latvia, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands). The work lasts for approximately 17 minutes. It is divided into two main parts separated by a “solo” for sampler, and framed by an introduction and conclusion: mm. 1–27 mm. 28–290 mm. 291–311 mm. 312–538 mm. 539–578 Introduction Part 1 Solo Part 2 Conclusion",

Each sample is always scored the same way. (4) The recorded files in the sampler’s sound bank have each been identified by the composer with descriptive labels; I will refer to the recordings using these names. The source material includes a wide variety of everyday sounds such as “applause,” “doorbell,” and “breathing.” The sounds have been recorded with conventional equipment, but at various distance and positions, and thus they sound unbalanced relative to one another. Each recording focuses on a single sound type, and extraneous or ambient sounds have been avoided. The sounds have an anonymous quality—not unlike pictograms—and do not seem to have been manipulated or edited to any significant extent (an exception is the extremely time-stretched sample “gunshot-slowmotion”). Many of the samples have been recorded close to the microphone so that, for example, the beer’s carbon dioxide sounds brilliant and the coffee slurp sounds “juicy.”",

Played in the correct order, the 18 syllables make up a quotation from investopedia.com: “Doubling up is a risky strategy, but it can yield large returns.” This quote also sums up the concept of the piece. The idea of doubling up is used in several ways in the music: (1) the samples and the orchestra’s imitations of them, (2) the sound as an intrinsic musical object and the sound as a sign of an action, and (3) the samples organized in a linear narrative and in timbral groupings. In the introductory notes of the score, Steen-Andersen elaborates on possible outcomes—or “returns”—“from the drunken and sloppy but deeply felt sing-along to the more musical ‘power of unison’ and the potentially rewarding effect of opening up something familiar for reinterpretation and re-experience by distorting or emphasizing its different elements or by presenting it in a new context.” Twelve Examples",

It consists of two attacks, coordinated so that each attack aligns with the beginning and end of the alarm pulses, creating the effect of a sharp attack and decay. The subsegments A1 and A2 work together to imitate the sound of the alarm clock. In a second segment, B, are the clarinet, trombone 1, and percussion 2 (thunder sheet). There is no obvious connection between segments A and B. They do not share the same contour, pitch content, rhythm, or dynamics, and segment B seems to evoke background noises (perhaps resonance from the room or noise from the recording itself), whereas the sound source of segment A is the alarm clock.

The basic idea of segment analysis is to group parts according to how alike they are; this aligns with the methods for creating streams and stream segregation described in Bregman’s Auditory Scene Analysis ( 1990 ). The challenge with segment analysis is to evaluate the different reasons for grouping instruments together or not. For example, if two instruments share pitch content but not rhythm, one needs to consider the larger context of the music to decide how closely related they are. The purpose of segment analysis is to present a particular interpretation of the orchestration and thereby provide insight into the methods used to orchestrate a work; in turn, this allows for a discussion of the work’s higher-level conceptual orchestration strategies.",

In many cases, the primary source is heard in the foreground, while the background is composed of room ambience, environmental sounds, and/or recording noise. Example 1 is a typical instance of this division. The sound of the alarm clock is shown as segment A, but what is the purpose of segment B? The composer comments in the introductory notes to the score: “Many of the softer sounds, though, are orchestrations of background noises and hums and will not always be audible in the samples. These background sounds should be kept down, even if it feels as if they are not being heard, just adding a general dirtiness to the overall sound.” It is not entirely clear what Steen-Andersen means when he refers to noises and hums that “will not always be audible in the samples,” but I assume that he is referring to sounds that are partially inaudible as a result of the quality of the audio equipment, the placement of the speakers, and/or the acoustics of the music hall. Air sounds, in particular, are a regular feature in the scoring of these background sounds (B subsegments). (9) It therefore seems safe to assume that the air sounds represent a type of noise found on virtually all of the recordings, such as the noise, hiss, and hum typical of low-fi audio.

I argue that it should, and that doublings in this context need not necessarily involve identical pitches and rhythms in different instruments. Example 13c, an excerpt taken from Example 9, makes the issue even clearer. If the parts are to be considered doublings, they must have some aspect in common that is doubled. The common features of the three parts in Example 13c are a falling pitch, sixteenth-note rhythm, and crescendo.

Only if the chord moves in parallel motion does it become a kind of doubling, in which the other chord tones are perceived as subordinate to the chord root because of their lack of independent motion. This kind of hierarchy can also be implied using dynamics. For instance, in Example 14a , the chord tones are of equal loudness (albeit in a somewhat unusual voicing, with the chord seventh doubled at the octave). But in Example 14b , the soft notes in the violin 2 and viola function more as a coloration of the cello’s attack than as independent chord tones. In Example 14c , an excerpt from Example 2 (“button-mechanical”), a few pitches are added to the cello’s noisy attack at a much quieter dynamic. These pitches seem to function as neither chord members nor doublings, but instead as a supplement to the texture.

But the relationship between the three voices in segment B is difficult to explain. The voices do not double one another, since they are not the same type of noise, and they are not unique enough to be interpreted as individual subsegments, since they are temporally aligned and difficult to perceive as separate streams. The border between supplement and sub-segment is probably impossible to define in the abstract, and considering the complexity of the topic, this brief overview is in no way intended to be exhaustive, but hopefully it provides an idea of how the orchestration in Double Up arises as a sum of different parts.

Typically, simultaneous segments also share the same dynamic notation, possibly differing by a single dynamic degree (e.g., foreground f and background mf ).

In Example 11, the foreground consists of cello and double bass playing ff , while the first trombone plays at a somewhat weaker f and the second trombone at an even weaker mf . The primary sound is that of the strings, colored by the trombones. A similar situation is found in Example 10: the slap stick dominates the overall sonority with an ff dynamic, colored by mf in the tom-tom and more subtly by a p pizzicato in the strings. Since dynamics are not an objective parameter (i.e., an f marking does not always indicate the same dynamic level), they are always played in relation to the instruments involved, making the use of individual dynamics both complicated and risky: how do the musicians find the right dynamic balance without knowing what dynamics the other musicians are playing? However a skewed balance between different instruments is not a problem in itself, and it offers opportunities to create colors that go beyond conventional instrumental combinations with an equally weighted dynamic balance. And some of the balance issues in Double Up can be resolved by the principle of imitation. At least in theory, the musicians are able to hear the desired balance in the sampler’s audio files (from the score: “If you recognize the sound you’re playing in the sample played at the same time, you may adjust or intonate to the sound to make it melt together better”).",

In traditional orchestral music, the orchestra’s sonority, volume, and register are greatly affected by octave doublings. However, Double Up contains hardly any octave doublings.

In general listeners tend to identify the instruments playing based on many different factors like spectral shape, onset and offset transients, pitch features, multiple pitches vs. isolated pitches, blending qualities, and knowledge of the listener ( Eronen 2001 ). Therefore, when the intention is to anonymize the instruments playing, several aspects need to be considered and modified. One way that Steen-Andersen does this is by frequently using extended playing techniques. 56% of the woodwind entrances in mm. 28–58 consist of air sounds, clicks, and key sounds. In the brass, 66% of entrances in the same section are air sounds, clicks, and “palm hit mouthpiece,” while 31% of the playing techniques in the strings consist of “hit strings with palm,” “along the string,” “slow bow,” “col legno battuto,” and “clicker.” (12) Extended techniques do not necessarily anonymize the instrumental sound, but the differences in sonority between wood and brass instruments, for example, are considerably reduced when playing air sounds in comparison with conventional playing. Still, even when the instruments in Double Up are used conventionally, they are often difficult to recognize. This may be due to the use of relatively unusual instrumental combinations with unequal dynamic balancing, as well as to the fact that an instrument is often assigned just one note, thereby reducing the sound of the instrument to one sound.",

                "text": "[5.3] None of the orchestral strategies in Double Up are entirely new; they all have some roots in earlier compositional traditions. Doubling is of course inscribed into the DNA of the symphony orchestra—the chorus effect of the string section is made by multiple strings doubling one another. Chamber-music orchestration is often used for brief contrasting passages in the symphonic literature, although using it consistently throughout a piece is rare. Likewise, the anonymization of instruments, such as concealing one instrument behind the tone of another as in a scored sforzando, or instruments within one another as in a perfect blend or a mass texture is common within the literature. (14) In this work it is the overall anonymization of instruments that is unusual.",

In Mahler’s orchestral music, however, there are many examples of individual dynamics; mixtures of sounds such as those used in Ravel’s Bolero could also be seen as early traces of this concept. The technique is strongly represented in more recent works, such as the opening of Gérard Grisey’s Partiels (1975). Here, the opening chord is orchestrated based on a frequency analysis ( Rose 1996 ). Grisey calls it “instrumental synthesis,” referring to the practice of working with additive synthesis in electronic music ( Fineberg 2000 ; O’Callaghan 2015 ). The strategies of pre-orchestration and orchestration without regard to context have a much shorter history. They might be seen as an extension of similar predetermined compositional algorithms such as those in Babbitt’s Composition for Four Instruments (1948), in which the instruments are combined in a systematic way, or as inspired by automatic orchestration like that in Peter Ablinger’s Quadraturen V (2000), in which any given recording is analyzed by a computer program and the result is sent directly to a music-notation program creating the parts for the orchestra to play ( Ablinger 2006 ).",

                "text": "[5.5] The main issue in Double Up considered here does not center on these strategies, but rather on their use in connection with imitation. In contrast to the imitations in Double Up , imitations of sounds in earlier music are highly stylized by tonal, rhythmic, and orchestration conventions. More recently, however, acoustic imitation of recordings has become noticeably more widespread. Some of the more well-known examples are Clarence Barlow’s Im Januar am Nil (1984), discussed in Poller 2015 ; Peter Ablinger’s Drei Minuten für orchester (2003); and Jonathan Harvey’s Speakings (2008), discussed in Nouno et al. 2009 . In each case the orchestration strategies as well as the intentions of the imitations are very different. But what they have in common is the use of imitation based on sound recordings, and computer-assisted orchestration relying on frequency analysis. (15) O’Callaghan ( 2015 ) presents a brief survey of this topic, describing a “growing body of works” using frequency analysis to explore “extra-musical” source materials and engaging in a mimetic discourse with the ethos of soundscape music. Double Up only shares some of these qualities. There is no use of computer-assisted orchestration in Double Up . This kind of scientific approach, the objectivity and safety it brings into the orchestration, is not a part of Double Up . But it is certainly possible to see Double Up as part of a mimetic discourse, although a more humorous one than the other works mentioned.",

The work suggests no illusions about a meeting between art and reality but nevertheless offers a twist on this duality in that the orchestra is imitating sampled sounds. Viewed in this way, the orchestra is “sampling” the samples by dividing the sound picture into a foreground and background. It recreates the samples and their different recording perspectives through supplemental sounds, additive orchestration and unique combinations of instruments. Ultimately the orchestra behaves like a sampler, being undefined and repeatable through anonymization and pre-orchestration.",

But the strategies described only narrow the choices of orchestration rather than defining them completely, leaving compositional choices still to be made by the composer. In my opening statement, I called Double Up anti-orchestral. This is at best a problematic description, because while Double Up might sound unusual in its departure from traditional precepts of “good” orchestration as presented in textbooks like Adler’s Study of Orchestration ( 1989 ), it is certainly valuable as an example of alternative orchestral possibilities. The main reasons Double Up sounds so unusual are (1) the combination of orchestration strategies and (2) the fact that the imitations are combined with the original samples, thereby becoming a distortion.",

Had Double Up consisted of samples alone, the work’s first half would have given the impression of a somewhat overstated piece of radio theater. If, on the other hand, the work had consisted of the orchestral parts alone, it would have seemed abstract and incomprehensible. Double Up achieves a balance whereby the electronic soundtrack loses some of its indexical clarity, while the orchestra in turn gains some of these qualities. Double Up can thus be seen as a response to two pronounced trends in the field of acoustic and electronic music: the tendency of electronic music to manipulate specific recordings virtually beyond recognition, and the attempt of acoustic music to evoke associations and meanings beyond the explicit acoustic signal.",
