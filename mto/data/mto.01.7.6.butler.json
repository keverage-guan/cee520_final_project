    "abstract": "This paper considers some of the issues involved in the analysis of rhythm and meter in electronic dance music. It begins by considering metrical dissonance and ambiguity within the context of a layered approach to musical meter; it also highlights some of the distinctive ways in which these phenomena are manifested in this repertory. The second half of the paper focuses on the use of asymmetrical patterns in electronic dance music and considers some broader questions of rhythmic and metrical theory. Throughout, the paper draws upon a number of different music-theoretical sources, including work by Harald Krebs, Jay Rahn, and Christopher Hasty, as well as scholarship in ethnomusicology and cognitive science.",

            "text": "1. Because of the profusion of terms describing the various subcategories of contemporary dance music, I prefer to use the umbrella term “electronic dance music” when speaking of the repertoire as a whole. Dance music fans in the general public—who are highly sensitive to issues of style and genre in this repertoire—also employ this term. Other catch-all terms, such as “techno” and “electronica,” are problematic in various ways: to dance music fans, “techno” frequently connotes something more specific (a particular style of electronic dance music), and “electronica” is often viewed suspiciously as a marketing term devised by the music industry. For descriptions of the various genres and subgenres of electronic dance music, see “Talking Music: Sounds from the Dance,” in The New York Times Online , http://www.nytimes.com/library/music/031300dj-techno.html ; links to sound files, interviews, and other features are included.

Krebs does refer very briefly to such a situation, noting that “where there is no metrical framework, the layer initiated earlier usually functions as the referential layer” (ibid., 261, n. 20). While this principle seems plausible, it remains hypothetical within the context of Krebs’s book, as none of his examples fall into this category. Even if we do accept it, it is difficult to apply in this case, as both layers begin almost simultaneously and at a low volume. Krebs has concurred with my assertion that selective attention can change which layer functions as referential in this example (personal communication, May 2000).",

Interestingly, if any other note within this pattern were taken as the downbeat, it would be considerably less syncopated; one such rearrangement is shown in Example 1c . Such a move, however, would shift the percussion parts onto weak sixteenth-note beats. It would be quite unusual for the bass drum to be syncopated in this manner; when present, it tends to function as a source of metrical stability in EDM, most likely due to its status as the lowest and most resonant element in the texture. Research in music cognition supports this claim (for instance, Handel and Oshinsky found that when the frequency between metrically dissonant elements varies, listeners tend to choose the lower frequency as stable; see “Syncopated Auditory Polyrhythms,” 4), as does observation of EDM in performance (when played at a typical performance volume, the bass drum will be felt throughout the entire body).",

(See Andrew Imbrie, “‘Extra’ Measures and Metrical Ambiguity in Beethoven,” in Beethoven Studies , ed. Alan Tyson [New York: Norton, 1973], 45–66.) When presented with conflicting cues, conservative listeners tend to hold onto previously established metrical interpretations for as long as possible, whereas radicals move on to new interpretations more readily. In Example 2b , a conservative hearing is supported by the lack of a strong downbeat orientation in the drumbeat pattern and by the fact that the articulations of this pattern occur on weak beats of the previously established meter; a radical hearing is supported by the previously mentioned tendency of low drumbeats to function as metrically stable in EDM (in contrast to cymbals, which usually function as backbeats) and by the fact that the drum pattern begins one eighth note before the synth and cymbal patterns (if the drum were the backbeat, its pattern would more logically begin on the “and” of beat one).",

There are a few notable exceptions to this trend: certain styles of house music feature vocals quite prominently; drum-n-bass/jungle DJs sometimes perform in conjunction with rappers (MCs); and “crossover” artists such as Moby are also more likely to utilize vocals. Nevertheless, the above statement holds true for the majority of electronic dance music; it is quite common to hear several hours worth of music at an EDM performance without encountering a single vocal. Furthermore, the exceptions to this phenomenon tend to push toward or be classified as other genres; for instance, certain performers are classified as crossover acts because their vocally driven songs are seen as moving toward the style and structure of radio-friendly pop.",

Rap in particular shares many aspects of EDM’s layered approach to musical construction, and layering has been emphasized in analytical approaches to rap as well. For instance, see Tricia Rose, Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America (Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press, 1994); Robert Walser, “Rhythm, Rhyme, and Rhetoric in the Music of Public Enemy,” Ethnomusicology 39.2 (1995), 193–217; and Adam Krims, Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000). Nonetheless, the absence of vocals, in combination with the more central role of the DJ, creates significant textural differences between EDM and rap. It should also be noted that live performances (generally called “live p.a.’s”) are becoming increasingly common in electronic dance music, especially in its more experimental genres. These performances are usually quite different from those seen in other types of popular music, though. The artists do not play any sort of standard instrument; instead, they manipulate studio technology and software in a real-time environment. (An extreme example occurred at the 2001 Detroit Electronic Music Festival, when artist Nobukazu Takemura and another musician performed solely on laptop computers.) Another difference is that many EDM artists create new works when performing rather than attempting to recreate their recorded works.",

Although there are similarities between the GTTM approach and some of the views of meter expressed by ethnomusicologists, I would disagree with Temperley’s assertion that “there is almost unanimous agreement” among ethnomusicologists that African music has meter as defined by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (Temperley, “Meter and Grouping in African Music,” 68; see also 76). In fact, scholars present very diverse opinions on meter and rhythm in this music; even those who seem to share the same general view often differ markedly on various points. Furthermore, due to an unfortunate lack of intellectual exchange between music theory and ethnomusicology—a situation that has only begun to change quite recently—it is difficult to make claims that relate ethnomusicological views of meter to specific music-theoretical ones with any certainty. In his 1999 paper, Temperley argues that syncopations in rock can be understood as displacements from specific positions in a metrical grid. While this is helpful in showing how Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s model might be extended to highly syncopated repertoires, it will not be discussed at length here, as it is not especially applicable to situations like the one presented above for several reasons: first, it is based on textual accentuation, which is rarely a factor in EDM; second, in all of the examples considered by Temperley, the accompanying instruments clearly convey an evenly spaced metrical structure; and third, none of Temperley’s examples contain regularly recurring asymmetrical patterns like the ones shown in Example 4e .",

While figural hearing might seem incompatible with Hasty’s emphasis on the projection of specific durations, I would argue that it could still be posited as an additional mode complementary to projective hearing.

Hasty does in fact discuss research by Handel (see Meter as Rhythm , 124–25 and 173), though the passages cited do not address figural organization in particular.",

Though (as I will argue in the concluding paragraph) further research is necessary to answer these questions fully, I would like to comment briefly on the issues raised in this sentence. As discussed above ( paragraphs 10-15 ), the phenomena addressed in this paper are not limited to EDM, though their manifestations within it are part of a distinctive constellation of features. Regarding the various genres of EDM itself, I believe that the research presented here can be applied to a broad cross-spectrum of the music, though as I have noted elsewhere, certain features may be more applicable to some genres than others. In selecting the musical examples presented here, I have chosen works from relatively well-known artists with the intent of making the paper more accessible. The artists represented incorporate a variety of genres into their work. The Chemical Brothers are most commonly classified as “big beat,” a term referring to dance music that incorporates some of the song structures and sonic elements of rock and hip-hop (though I believe this aspect of their work has been overemphasized). Everything But the Girl have a long history that has only recently (ca. 1995) begun to include EDM elements; since then, however, they have collaborated with many prominent dance musicians and have successfully incorporated a variety of EDM styles into their work. Underworld (who recently disbanded) are difficult to place within a particular genre, as their individualistic sound shows the influence of techno, deep house, breakbeat, and dub; however, their music has often been characterized broadly as techno (for instance, see Dom Phillips, “Underworld,” in The Rough Guide to Techno [London: The Rough Guides, 2000]). In spite of the commercial success of these artists and the fact that some of their work includes elements of other popular music genres, I have avoided work that might be considered “crossover” (such as The Chemical Brothers’ collaborations with Oasis and other pop musicians), and I believe that the music included here represents trends central to EDM.",

Written discussions of electronic dance music also tend to highlight its \n\nrhythmic qualities—references to its “unrelenting rhythm,” “pulsing dance rhythms,” \n\nand “irresistible tribal rhythm” are common (2) —and \n\nfans often refer to the music simply as “beats” (as in, “let’s go to the club and \n\nhear some beats”).

At the beginning of this example, two distinct textural \n\nlayers, defined by timbre and by rhythmic patterns, are audible; they are not aligned, \n\nhowever ( Example 1a ). Accents \n\nare created by register in the synthesizer pattern and by attack-point spacing in \n\nthe percussion part, thus suggesting two different streams of quarter-note pulses. \n\nThis state of nonalignment continues for about thirty seconds. Although the balance \n\nbetween the two parts changes as the example unfolds, neither beat pattern stands \n\nout clearly as the dominant one. Thus one can easily shift attention from one pattern \n\nto another, so that the figure/ground relationship between the two patterns reverses. (3) In fact, the reader is encouraged to do so while listening to the example. [5] This pattern forms what Harald Krebs would describe as \n\na displacement dissonance, a type of metrical dissonance in which two or more layers \n\nof the same length are nonaligned. (4) The term metrical dissonance is derived from Maury Yeston’s discussion of rhythmic consonance and dissonance. (5) Like Yeston, Krebs believes that meter is formed by the interaction of several different \n\nlayers of motion. Usually at least three layers are present: the pulse layer, which \n\nis the fastest regular layer of motion, and two or more slower-moving interpretive \n\nlayers, which group the pulse layer into larger units. In 4 3 time, for example, \n\nthere is a pulse layer consisting of eighth-note motion, one interpretive layer \n\nof quarter-note motion, and a larger interpretive layer of dotted-half-note motion.

                "text": "[6] A displacement dissonance occurs when an interpretive layer sounds like it \n\nis displaced from a metrical layer; the conflicting layer is called the antimetrical layer. Since electronic sound production facilitates this sort of nonalignment, \n\nit is not surprising that it is a frequent source of metrical dissonance in EDM. \n\nIn Example 1a, a sixteenth-note \n\npulse layer is grouped by two different patterns moving in quarter notes. This excerpt \n\ndiffers from most of Krebs’ examples, however, because it is in a certain sense prior to meter; there is no larger layer grouping the quarter notes into \n\nmeasures. This heightens the ambiguity of the example: it is unclear which layer \n\nis metrical and which is antimetrical. (7) If we decide to focus on the synthesizer pattern, then we hear the snare drum being \n\ndisplaced by three sixteenth notes, a dissonance that Krebs would describe as D4+3. (8) On the other hand, if we attend to the snare drum pattern, then we hear the synthesizer \n\nas displaced by a single sixteenth-note, or D4+1. Both of these possibilities are \n\nsummarized at the bottom of Example \n\n1a. According to Krebs, the closer a dissonance is to a state of alignment, \n\nthe greater the intensity of its dissonance. In this example, then, either possibility \n\ncreates a rather strong dissonance. If the layers were displaced by two sixteenth \n\nnotes, however, the dissonance would be less intense; furthermore, there would be \n\nless opportunity for reinterpretation. Example 1b .

                "text": "[9] In this example, the entrance of a new layer resolves a metrical dissonance. \n\nIn other cases, such an entrance may actually create a metrical dissonance. \n\nFor example, at the beginning of the song “Cups” from Underworld’s 1998 album Beaucoup Fish , the synthesizer pattern clearly begins on the downbeat of a 4 4 measure, as shown in Example 2a . \n\nThis hearing is soon confirmed by a cymbal pattern articulating a quarter-note pulse. \n\nAfter about fifteen seconds of the synthesizer pattern, however, a loud drumbeat \n\ncomes in with a different pattern, whose entrance is offset from the previously \n\nestablished measure by a single eighth note. If one focuses on this drumbeat, it \n\nis possible to hear the beat pattern shift, so that the synthesizer and cymbal patterns \n\nnow seem to occur on offbeats. As shown in Example 2b , the repetition \n\nof these patterns suggests a D8+1 displacement dissonance. At this point, though, \n\nthe evidence for this hearing remains inconclusive; conservative listeners may not \n\nbe willing to give up the initial metrical framework just yet. (10) The displacement becomes definitive, however, after the first eight bars of the \n\ndrumbeat, when a new synthesizer pattern begins to reinforce the downbeat of the \n\ndrumbeat pattern ( Example 2c ). [10] Electronic dance music is not the only type of popular \n\nmusic in which displacement dissonances occur, of course. Other scholars have pointed \n\nout related phenomena in repertoires such as rock, jazz, and blues. For instance, \n\nDave Headlam has discussed the use of metrical conflict and “metric shift” in “Rollin’ \n\nand Tumblin’,” a work that began as a blues song and was subsequently recorded by \n\nthe rock band Cream. Headlam’s analysis centers on a motive that appears in several \n\nversions of the song. In recordings by blues musicians such as Muddy Waters, the \n\nmotive is syncopated, emphasizing beats 2 and 4 of each 4 4 bar. This pattern of \n\naccentuation is highlighted further in the 1966 Cream version, when a newly added \n\ndrum pattern (which initially reinforced the prevailing meter) is shifted one beat \n\nover, producing a displacement dissonance. The conflict created by this dissonance \n\nis eventually resolved, however, during the B section of the song, in which both \n\nthe motive (now appearing one beat earlier) and the drum pattern align perfectly \n\nwith the meter.

(13) For the purposes of the present discussion, then, the significance of these metrical \n\nphenomena lies not in the mere fact of their occurrence in electronic dance music, \n\nbut rather in the distinctive ways in which they are used. For instance, consider \n\nhow the metrical dissonances described above are situated within the larger works \n\nof which they are a part. In the EDM examples, metrical dissonance almost always \n\noccurs as part of a process unfolding continuously in real time. In comparison, \n\nin the examples discussed by Headlam and Covach, related metrical dissonances are \n\ngenerally separated from each other temporally, sometimes by rather considerable \n\ndistances (for instance, the time interval between the second and third appearance \n\nof the dissonance in “Close to the Edge” is approximately 9 minutes). After their \n\ninitial presentations, their implications and inherent tensions are developed in \n\nvarious ways, as might occur with a motive in a Classical work. (14) The exploration of motivic possibilities is also a well-known feature of jazz improvisation, \n\nand Cynthia Folio’s examples can be understood in these terms. (15) In electronic dance music, on the other hand, the emphasis is not so much on the \n\nlong-range exploration of a motive’s possibilities as it is on producing an immediate \n\nand striking effect—either to create a point of formal articulation (as in\n\nExample 1b, in which the resolution \n\nof the opening metrical dissonance coincides with the beginning of the work’s first \n\ngroove), or to introduce an element of surprise (as in Example 2, in which an otherwise \n\nstraightforward textural buildup is complicated by the introduction of a displacement \n\ndissonance). [12] Furthermore, while the types of metrical dissonance \n\ndiscussed by Krebs can occur in many different repertoires, they are particularly \n\nrelevant to electronic dance music for a number of reasons. As discussed above ( paragraph \n\n5 ), the Yeston/Krebs model conceptualizes meter as the union of several layers \n\nof motion. As in the music of Robert Schumann (the composer upon whom Krebs has \n\nfocused most extensively), these layers are particularly clear in electronic dance \n\nmusic. They often appear as discrete elements of the texture, individuated by timbre, \n\nregister, and pattern repetition. For instance, in a 4 4 meter, one might find one \n\npart of the texture articulating a quarter-note pulse, another moving primarily \n\nin eighth notes, and a third emphasizing the whole-note layer, with each element \n\nbeing registrally and timbrally distinct. Dissonant layers usually stand out clearly \n\nas well.",

In the studio, EDM is produced in a multi-channel environment, \n\nwhich allows all of its sound sources to be controlled independently, so that layers \n\nof motion can be combined in a variety of interesting ways. Of course, this technology \n\nis not limited to EDM; in fact, it is commonplace in contemporary popular music. \n\nIn most pop traditions, however, audiences expect performers to be able to produce \n\nreasonable facsimiles of their recordings in live performance, a factor that may \n\nlimit the complexity of metrical dissonance. This is not the case in EDM, though. \n\nIn this repertoire, a completely different tradition of live performance exists, \n\none in which DJs, rather than studio artists, take center stage. (17) For the most part, records are treated not as finished products but as raw material \n\nfor manipulation by the DJ. While the music that one hears at a nightclub or a rave \n\noriginates in the studio, records are rarely heard in their original studio-produced \n\nforms. Instead, they are manipulated and combined with other records in a real-time \n\nprocess that produces substantially different compositions. The DJ uses turntables \n\nto play two or more records at once and a mixing board to control the balance between \n\nthe records (one record is usually more prominent). The mixing board also allows \n\nthe DJ to control the high, middle, and low range of each record, which makes it \n\npossible to manipulate layers within as well as between records. This \n\ncapability facilitates the real-time creation of displacement dissonances like those \n\nseen in Examples 1a/1b\n\nand 2 (which are taken from studio-produced \n\nrecordings). For instance, reinterpretations (cf.\n\nExample 2b) can be created \n\nby playing a pattern such as that found in\n\nExample 2a on one record, \n\nthen bringing in the bass drum of another record on the offbeats. The lower, more \n\nresonant bass drum sound “turns the beat around,” but the first pattern persists, \n\nthereby producing a displacement dissonance. Conversely, given a situation like \n\nthat of Example 2c, the DJ \n\nmight use the high- and low-range controls to remove the bass drum and high synth \n\npattern, thus calling a seemingly clear metrical interpretation into question.",

As we have seen, \n\nthis approach manifests itself in a variety of ways: in techniques of performance \n\nand production, in the connection between metrical and textural layers, and in the \n\nrelative equality of textural layers. In fact, this last feature promotes another \n\ndistinctive characteristic of this repertoire: in many cases, especially near the \n\nbeginning of a track, there is no definitive accentual interpretation of a passage. \n\nExamples 1 and 2 demonstrate this phenomenon quite clearly. In\n\nExample 1a, as previously discussed, \n\nit is unclear which layer is metrical and which is antimetrical; in\n\nExample 2, a layer that is suggested \n\nas metrical eventually turns out to be antimetrical. (18) The absence of a definite interpretation in such situations encourages the listener \n\nto experiment with different interpretations. In repetitive music such as EDM, this \n\nambiguity often plays a crucial role in the creation of musical interest. In fact, \n\nSteve Reich has noted a similar phenomenon in minimalist music. Of his own music, \n\nhe says: “If I compose music that is to use repeating patterns and is also to remain \n\ninteresting I must build in rhythmic ambiguity to make it possible for the \n\near to hear a given pattern beginning and ending in different places depending on \n\nslight differences of accent and on how one listens.” (19)",

(37) For instance, following Clough and Douthett, (38) Rahn notes that these “diatonic rhythms” are maximally even: in informal terms, \n\nthis means that the number of attacks within each pattern is distributed as evenly \n\nas possible among the pulses in the cycle. This property can also be seen in EDM, \n\nwhich contains many of the diatonic rhythms that Rahn discusses. For example, the \n\nquarter-eighth/quarter-eighth/quarter (2+1+2+1+2) pattern of\n\nExample 4 and Example 5 is a maximally even distribution of five attacks among eight pulses—in contrast, \n\nfor example, to the foursquare rhythm eighth-eighth-eighth-eighth-half. (39) Furthermore, while certain foursquare patterns (e.g., four quarter notes in 4 4 time) are also maximally even, diatonic rhythms such as 2+1+2+1+2 are maximally individuated as well. In other words, each note within the pattern has a \n\nunique set of relationships with every other note. For instance, in the 2+1+2+1+2 \n\npattern, the third note occurs three pulses after the first note, one pulse after \n\nthe second note, two pulses before the fourth note, and three pulses before the last \n\nnote; no other note within the pattern has the same set of relations to its surrounding \n\nnotes. In addition, in contrast to maximally individuated foursquare rhythms (for example, half-quarter-eighth-eighth), \n\nnotes within diatonic rhythms cannot be easily ranked in terms of metrical strength.

In a 1998 article, \n\nHandel considers how metrical structure interacts with a special type of grouping \n\nknown as figural organization. (41) When figural organization is in effect, tones are heard as discrete groups. The \n\nlistener attends to the number of tones constituting each group, but not to the \n\nexact timing between the groups. This means that different rhythms can have the \n\nsame figural organization. For instance, in a 16-pulse pattern, the rhythms X.X..X....X.X... and X.X....X..X.X... (where Xs stand for attacks, dots stand for unarticulated beats, and tones separated \n\nby only one beat are considered part of the same group) have an identical figural \n\norganization, which Handel defines as two tones, silence, one tone, silence, two \n\ntones, silence (or 2-1-2-). (42) Cognitive \n\npsychologists have claimed that meter is necessary to compensate for the imprecision \n\nof figural hearing—that listeners use it to measure the differences between otherwise \n\nsimilar rhythms. The three experiments that form the basis of Handel’s article suggest, \n\nhowever, that figural organization may be just as important as meter in rhythmic \n\nperception. Handel found that listeners tend to have a hard time discriminating \n\nbetween rhythms with the same figural structure; (43) furthermore, the effect of meter (and of various strategies aimed at highlighting \n\nmetrical organization) is particularly limited in “weakly metric” patterns (those \n\nin which the majority of attacks do not coincide with tactus-level beats). Handel’s \n\nfocus on the relationship between meter and “weakly metric” rhythms makes his work \n\npromising for scholars of electronic dance music, since asymmetrical patterns frequently \n\nintermingle with even rhythms in this repertory. (A classic example is 808 State’s \n\ntrack “Cubik,” in which a prominent 3+3+3+3+4 synthesizer pattern sounds against \n\neven quarter-note drumbeats.) Handel’s findings, like those of Rahn, discourage \n\nus from viewing asymmetrical rhythms as embellishments of a metrical background \n\nand provide another way of accounting for their distinctive perceptual qualities.

Although Hasty claims that our perception of such patterns is complex, he notes \n\nthat they should not be considered “unnatural or confused.” (47) His approach is useful for EDM because it does not simply describe irregular patterns \n\nas syncopated, but rather provides a detailed description of the processes engendering \n\ntheir rhythmic complexity. In this way it can provide a convincing account of the \n\nrichness that one perceives in the rhythmic surface of this music. (48)",

                "text": "[36] As the foregoing discussion has shown, the approaches of Rahn, Handel, and \n\nHasty each provide a distinctive contribution to our understanding of the asymmetrical \n\npatterns that occur in electronic dance music. Rahn provides a structural account \n\nof the special characteristics of these rhythms, while Handel and Hasty focus more \n\non issues of perception. Handel suggests an alternate mode of hearing that may play \n\na role in the cognition of such patterns; Hasty, on the other hand, applies the \n\nsame perceptual principle (projection) to all meters, while also showing the unique \n\nways it plays out in irregularly spaced meters. While there are obvious differences \n\nbetween these approaches, they should not be considered mutually exclusive. For \n\ninstance, although Rahn and Handel, unlike Hasty, preserve a separation between \n\nrhythm and meter, their respective emphases (structural properties and figural hearing) \n\ncould still be situated within Hasty’s method. (49) Likewise, Hasty’s discussion of projection could be applied to asymmetrical patterns \n\neven if those patterns are not considered strictly metrical. In fact, I would ultimately \n\nconclude that such patterns are not generally metrical in electronic dance music \n\n(given that they usually occur in conjunction with regularly spaced patterns that \n\ncan be heard as metrical more easily). (50) Nonetheless, I would argue that they should not be treated as transient foreground \n\nphenomena superimposed onto an underlying regular structure. Rather, as these three \n\nmethods show us, these rhythms have a distinctive presence of their own and should \n\nbe considered structurally significant in their own right.",

                "text": "[37] Our exploration has shown a variety of ways in which rhythm and meter are \n\nused to create musical interest in electronic dance music. Displacement dissonances \n\nsubvert metrical stability; inherently ambiguous patterns encourage multiple interpretations; \n\nand asymmetrical patterns counteract the regularity of persistent even rhythms. \n\nThe common link between all these phenomena is an emphasis on interpretive multiplicity. \n\nIn other words, electronic dance music encourages us to hear it in a variety of \n\nways. As we have seen, this multiplicity functions on many different levels. Individual \n\npatterns are often intrinsically ambiguous. Furthermore, they frequently remain \n\nso even when used in combination: when there is no definitive metrical layer, the \n\ndistinction between metrical and antimetrical layers may not be apparent. Even when \n\nall the elements of a meter are in place, reinterpretations can turn the \n\nbeat around, showing the listener that the metrical structure was not quite what \n\nit seemed to be. And finally, the persistent repetition of both asymmetrical and \n\neven patterns encourages multiple perspectives on rhythmic and metrical structure, \n\nthereby undermining any sense that there is a singular structure underlying \n\nthe music.",
