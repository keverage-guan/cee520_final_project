    "abstract": "This article discusses the functions of continuous processes in contemporary electronic dance music (EDM), providing an analytical framework for discussing their structural and aesthetic roles in this repertoire. Continuous processes are musical gestures with continuous changes to musical parameters, rather than discrete, “step-by-step” ones. Examples include pitch slides (glissandos), crescendos, fade ins, accelerandos, and filter sweeps. Continuous processes in this repertoire are created with “continuous controllers” such as sliders and knobs, or are programmed into tracks with “automation curves.” Functionally, continuous processes often provide sonic instructions for dancers. They can be used by creators at strategic times to provide ornamentation, orientation (often accompanied by intensification or de-intensification), or disorientation (usually in breakdown sections). This article adds to existing analytical scholarship by drawing attention to the many roles of continuous processes in EDM, and showing how they contribute to the emotional waves experienced when listening to this music.",

You’re a surfer.” (1) Similarly, producer Rick Snoman, author of the influential Dance Music Manual , says that all dance music “deals mostly in emotional waves, consisting of building and dropping the arrangement to generate an emotional state in the audience” ( Snoman 2009 , 269). These “emotional waves” of tension and release occur in virtually all forms of music, but they are manifested in specific ways in contemporary EDM and EDM-influenced pop songs. (2) How do dancers know when the waves are coming, and how to “ride” them? What musical components participate in these narratives to create varying degrees of energy and tension in EDM? Example 1 .

                "text": "[1.2] Some aspects of tension and release in EDM are caused by what I call discrete processes. For example, Mark Butler states that EDM listeners correlate tension and energy levels with texture changes ( 2006 , 221). Tension is linked with the withholding of the beat and specifically the kick drum. The presence or absence of this low drum sound, and its entrance or exit from the texture, is highly important in determining the formal function of different sections in the track and their tension levels ( Butler 2006 , 91, 247). Both Butler and Stan Hawkins recognize metric irregularity and metrical dissonance as another source of tension ( Butler 2001 ; 2006 , 138–75; Hawkins 2003 , 92–94). Polyrhythms, syncopation, and displaced rhythms are all very important in EDM and contribute to its complexity and intensity throughout various tracks. Another common technique that increases tension in “buildup” sections is the snare-drum “roll” or “fill,” when percussive sounds such as snare-drum hits become closer and closer together until it almost sounds like a drum roll ( Snoman 2009 , 252, 266–68; Solberg 2014 , 70). The rhythm for a typical snare roll is shown in Example 1 . All three of these techniques can be described as discrete processes, since they involve the sudden entrance or exit of a sound layer, or the repetition of discrete sounds in a stratified texture. (3) The snare roll is an example of discrete acceleration, since the “speeding up” takes place in various stages of rhythmic diminution, such that the rhythmic values become twice as fast in each new stage.

(8) They are often broadly categorized as “effects.” For example, Hawkins ( 2003 ) refers to “effects processing” (90), “phasing effects” (91), “studio effects (filtering)” (95), “heavy echo effects” (96), and “special effects” (98) in his analysis of “French Kiss” by Lil’ Louis. He also describes “gradual manipulation of tempo” and a gradual “working up of the textures” without discussing these in detail ( Hawkins 2003 , 94). The term “effects processing” references a device called an “effects processor” that accomplishes “processing” (the modification and manipulation of sounds): one of the four functions of electronic music-making machines (along with synthesis, sampling, and sequencing) ( Butler 2006 , 56–57, 60). Effects processors and mixing boards contain knobs and sliders that facilitate continuous changes to musical parameters. Butler calls these knobs and sliders “continuous controllers” ( 2014 , 71). They can change parameters through technologies such as filters and LFOs with physical or digital interfaces, (9) and they can be utilized in live performance (as described in Butler 2014 , 70–87), or in studio production ( Wright 2017 , chap. 5). The physical and digital interfaces that producers work with influence the shapes of created musical gestures, and also the perception of those musical gestures by producers, fans, and analysts.

In DAWs, sound clips are represented as building blocks of music that can be changed, but are almost always quantized to the tempo and the key of the music. Discrete melodies are usually created with the “piano roll,” a vertical representation of the black and white piano keys. Continuous processes can be created through “in-time” movement of virtual knobs and sliders, and can also be programmed into preset sounds that are stored in sound banks (such as when a particular bass sound has vibrato programmed into it), or created through automation curves .

Put another way, continuous processes are usually understood as ontic rather than ontological. In describing his compositional method, deadmau5 talks about adding continuous processes such as “swells and dips” or “little weird effects and small variations” after the primary melodies and rhythms have been added ( Zimmerman 2016 , Lesson 13, 0:07 and 4:52). However, this does not diminish their importance. Many “effects” such as vibrato, siren sounds, the tremolo effect, and increasing delay or reverb, are highly salient and influence the “feel” of the music. Furthermore, in most of today’s popular EDM tracks, long crescendos and pitch slides in buildup sections are highly important continuous processes that are central to the form and aesthetics. A group of continuous processes that increase tension leading towards a musical climax in this way can be called a “riser” or a “soar.” (11)",

In contemporary culture where remixes are copious, continuous processes are not often part of the original “stems” of a track, but instead are added near the end of the production process or improvised during live performance ( Butler 2006 ; 2014 ; Zimmerman 2016 ). This does not mean that continuous processes are not salient or not important to the musical structure of tracks though, as the examples in this article show. Specifically, the functions of continuous processes in contemporary EDM can be described in three general categories: ornamentation, orientation, and disorientation. Ornamentation",

How short or long can a continuous process be before the continuous changes in it are imperceptible to the ear? How much change in a musical parameter is required for a process to be perceived as continuous? These are questions that have been discussed elsewhere, and there are borderline cases ( Smith 2019 , 140–51), but for now, I merely want to point out that continuous changes in musical parameters that last for a measure or less can still be important aspects of a composition. One way this is evident in contemporary EDM is when short, repeated continuous processes are used as effects to embellish discrete melodies and rhythms in a manner similar to Baroque ornamentation. The “tremolo effect” is one specific way that this is often accomplished. In music production, the tremolo effect refers to repeated continuous volume changes that create pulsating waves of sound. This is usually accomplished with an LFO.",

The articulation of the notes seems to start at the peak points of the waves. The amplitude graph showing these volume waves is shown in Example 4 and the spectrogram is shown in Example 5 . It is noteworthy that the waves show up clearly on the spectrogram, meaning that short filter sweeps are also being heard since the peak points of the wave have the most harmonics.

In the final core section (starting at 2:45, measure 9 in the example), the repeated B ♮ s in the vocal part are embellished with short continuous pitch slides.

They are often crucial in helping listeners know “where they are” in the formal or metrical structure of a track. In buildup sections, they usually increase tension leading towards the climactic goal of the “drop,” when the “beat” (usually the kick drum and sometimes the bass line or low frequencies in general) is (re-)introduced into the texture after a prolonged absence ( Butler 2006 , 246–47; Sayre 2014 ; Snoman 2019 , 332). In this context, the continuous processes are providing orientation to listeners through intensification. Ragnhild Solberg ( 2014 ) shows the importance of continuously rising pitch slides as an extremely common aspect of buildup sections in EDM tracks. She and Hawkins ( 2003 ) both incorporate spectrograms into their analyses that show the continuous nature of buildups (specifically the gradual increase in high frequencies) and the discrete, instantaneous nature of the drop. Asaf Peres ( 2016 , 75–84) talks about “gradual ascending gestures” (filter sweeps and pitch slides) in buildup sections of contemporary pop songs, noting that the sonic syntax of “setup-buildup-peak” he describes has its origins in EDM (2–3, 73). Furthermore, on filter sweeps in buildup sections, Snoman says “It is these filter movements that are typically used to create tension and movement in all forms of dance music and have formed the basis of the most well-respected dance records” ( 2009 , 226).",

Continuous processes play a significant role in this, leading the music toward a specific goal point. This is because the most common and salient types of continuous processes in buildups are ascending pitch slides or noise sweeps, and crescendos through increased volume or increased number of sounds in the texture. Both ascending gestures and crescendos are metaphorically associated with growth and increasing tension ( Brownrigg 2003 , 118–21; Huron 2006 , 326; Patty 2009 , 329), so they contribute to the sense that buildup sections are tense and moving towards a clear goal.",

This combination of ascending gestures and crescendos with clear and consistent beats creates tension without disorientation. This also makes buildup sections have a sense of renewed energy and excitement that engenders a sense of expectation in dancers, and allows them to prepare for the upcoming drop by re-entraining themselves to the beat. Snoman recognizes the importance of the return of the drums at the beginning of the buildup section, saying “the drum rhythm picks up again . . . signifying that the track is about to come back” ( 2009 , 226–27).",

They are almost ubiquitous not only in contemporary EDM but contemporary pop music in general ( Adams 2019 ; Osborn 2019 ; Peres 2016 , 73–125). Perhaps because of this pervasiveness, buildup sections are also often formulaic. The first part of the formula features a general increase in energy through techniques such as crescendos, ascending pitch slides, filter sweeps, and rhythmic diminution culminating in the “snare roll.” Three out of these four trademark signifiers for buildups involve continuous processes. The fourth, however, is based on clear, easily followed discrete rhythms that are in the drum parts (see Example 1).",

Not all buildups utilize this feature, but many do. Often most of the sounds are completely cut out of the texture except for one or two that serve a special function I call the “cue.” (13) This is a short anacrustic motive that is usually a vocal line, a speech sample, a melodic hook, or even just a single snare drum hit. It can last one beat, two beats, a whole bar (four beats), or rarely three beats. Cues are often self-referential and humorous, making fun of their obviousness, as in the spoken line “we came to smash this club” during the track “Smash” by DJ Exodus ( 2014 ). After the sudden drop off and the cue comes the instantaneous drop, the climactic moment when all of the elements, including the drums and the bass, return to the texture at the start of the core. The intensity and thrill of this moment is for many listeners the most pleasurable part of the EDM experience ( Solberg 2014 ; Solberg and Jensenius 2016 ). DJs and producers are aware of the formulaic nature of some buildups. Deadmau5 describes the formula as uncreative and cliché in his masterclass ( 2016 , lesson 13, 10:45–12:00).",

When these techniques are used before climaxes in contemporary popular music they are often referred to collectively as a “riser” and the ascending elements are called “uplifters” ( Peres 2016 , 19; Solberg 2014 , 70). However, continuous processes are also often used to decrease tension with decrescendos and descending gestures that are sometimes referred to by the oxymoronic term “downlifters” ( Smith 2019 , 23; Zen World 2017 ). Uplifters and downlifters occur right before and after hypermetric downbeats, establishing duple hypermeter at multiple levels, and orienting listeners to these structural marking points when new sounds are often introduced ( Snoman 2019 , 327–28). Usually, the uplifters and downlifters will be longer and louder in the mix when corresponding to more important hypermetric downbeats, as opposed to less important ones at midway points of sections.

The “breaking down” aspect is less obvious than in many EDM tracks, but it is signified here by the snare drum and hi-hat suddenly (that is, discretely) dropping out. This section also contains an extended continuous transformation of the timbre in Snow Tha Product’s voice. It seems to become deeper and more conventionally masculine, even though the pitches stay the same. This effect is accomplished through the slowing down of the voice, so that its frequencies become lower, but adjusting the rhythm as it slows down so that it stays in tempo with the track. When a periodic sound signal is literally sped up or slowed down, its frequency content becomes higher or lower and thus the timbre is adjusted.

At first, the speeding up makes the voice sound whiny and tinny, but then the human element disappears altogether, so that by the end of the section it sounds like any other instrumental loop. The continuous speeding up of the voice is also reflected in the rhythmic changes that are shown in the transcription, with the notes in between the beats gradually disappearing. Notably, the song’s lyrics are about “trying to find a way” and “struggling to find the words to say.” In the breakdown section these words are said as the voice continuously transforms its timbre, and then in the buildup the voice is reduced to only one word and blends in with the instrumental track, so the voice is literally struggling to find any words to say.",

Discrete processes also play a role in this intensification. At the start of the section the hi-hat returns to the texture but the kick drum drops out, as is common in buildup sections.

(16) Their ascents are broken up by various attack points and cutaways to a lower register (which also slowly rises but has less definite pitch because it contains numerous short pitch scoops), but their linear automation curves still continuously rise, with no breaks in terms of pitch. In the graph, the lighter-colored parts of the line represent parts of the continuous process in the higher register that are not literally sounding because the lower pitch scoops are present instead. Interestingly, the total number of attack points for both the upper and lower lines create a rhythm that is a textbook example of discrete acceleration, halving the number of attack points in a unit from eight (one lower plus seven higher) to four (one lower plus three higher) to two (one lower plus one higher) to one (one lower).

Firstly, Type B pitch slides are half as long as Type A, occurring over roughly four measures rather than eight. Their pitch ascents are also larger, moving approximately from C4 to C6, almost two octaves, double the span of Type A. (17) Since the consonant target of C (the dominant scale degree in the key of F minor) is never reached, the aesthetic effect of these glissandos is one of incompleteness. It sounds as if the processes are slowing down towards the end and their goal will never be reached. In the graph of pitch slide Type B ( Example 9 ), the last part of the line that reaches C6 is in a lighter color to represent the fact that C6 is never actually reached. Contrastingly, Type A slides do reach the consonant target pitch of F, the tonic, and in fact even break the linear pattern in order to do so, as can be seen in the sudden increase in steepness at the end of the Example 8 graph. If the pitch were to keep increasing at the constant rate of change, then the last note would be just below F, but in order to give the continuous process a sense of completeness, Bolivaro chose to have the last beat emphasize the tonic pitch, just before the start of the next section.",

Even if the attacks are articulated more clearly, as in the occurrence during the second breakdown section (2:49–2:56), the continuous rise in pitch is easier to hear because unlike Type A slides, Type B slides do not cut away to another, lower rhythmic idea. An additional notable difference between Type A and Type B slides is that the latter crescendo then diminuendo, whereas Type A only crescendo, so their continuous changes of volume are more complex.

Type A slides are used as part of a formulaic riser, to build up the energy of the track in all five buildup sections, because they are accompanied by crescendos and discrete acceleration each time. Contrastingly, Type B slides function more as “effects” and usually occur during sections where the track is more stable, including both cores and once during what I have called a “pre-core” that provides an intermediate level of stability in between two buildup sections. They are probably used this way because even though the pitch is continuously ascending (a technique that is associated with instability), the rhythm (when it is clear) is steady.

Type B also occurs once during the sectional type associated with the least stability in EDM, the breakdown. It is noteworthy that this occurrence in breakdown 2 is the one with sharpest timbre and clearest attack points, setting it apart in another way from its other manifestations. Overall, both types of pitch slides in this track are used to orient listeners to specific goal points. They create a constant feeling of energy and movement towards those goals, even during sections that are otherwise stable. Example 10 .

In the second buildup section, which could also be classified as verse 2 (1:50–2:15), a long filter sweep in the sounds accompanying the vocals gradually fills in the frequency spectrum leading up to the drop (the start of a chorus), as shown in Example 10 . Higher frequencies are continuously added. The result is a perceived continuous timbre change, especially in the synthesized chords. High-frequency percussion parts fade in, and at the end of the section a large crescendo occurs. All of this creates a strong drive to the climactic goal, intensified by a one-beat break right before the drop.

In fact, the terms riser and drop have made their way into scholarship and common discourse about contemporary pop music, with slightly changed meanings from their original usage as described earlier in this article. In the context of pop music, the terms riser and drop (the latter of which is also sometimes called “pop-drop”) now usually refer to entire formal sections. This contrasts with their original meanings in the EDM community, which were ascending pitch slides, and the instantaneous moment when the beat comes back, respectively. For example, compare the description of these terms as “sounds” in Snoman ( Snoman 2019 , 294) with the description of them as formal sections in the work of Alyssa Barna ( 2020 ) and Brad Osborn ( 2019 , 160–161). In songs with “EDM form” ( Osborn 2019 , 160–61), the continuous processes in the riser section can lead to either a pop-drop or a “dance chorus” ( Barna 2020 ). In either case, they orient listeners to the formal structure of the song. Example 11 .

The spectrogram for the section is shown in Example 11 , and is annotated to show different shapes of three continuous processes. The section starts with downlifters in the form of a linear descending noise sweep (a filter sweep applied to “noise,” Peres 2016 , 44) which makes the high frequencies fade out. This takes place over approximately three measures. In the fourth measure, uplifters start continuously rising over two octaves. These pitch slides take the shape of an exponential curve, ascending faster and faster towards the end. Finally, two measures before the end of the section and the start of the next core, a low-cut (high-pass) filter continuously removes low frequencies from the texture. This happens for seven beats. On the last beat of the section, tension is released and the low frequencies are re-introduced, not suddenly, but quickly with a linear motion. This quick release functions as a “cue” for listeners. The resulting shape of the two filter sweeps is a triangle, as shown in the annotated spectrogram. All of the continuous processes in this section (downlifters, uplifters, and the filter sweeps at the end) provide signals to listeners about falling and rising tension. They orient listeners to the formal structure of the track.",

This sometimes occurs both in recorded tracks and in live performance. After a riser, dancers will immediately expect a climactic drop with many loud sounds, but this does not always happen. Sometimes the drop is only delayed by a measure or so, and other times it is entirely avoided for a long period of time. This is an important way in which artists create further tension by “teasing” audiences before resolution ( Butler 2014 , 221; Snoman 2019 , 331–32). Example 12 .

In the key of C ♯ minor, a quiet tonic pitch enters the texture around beat six of this section (at 1:32.90, as shown in the graph of Example 12 ), and then slowly ascends a ninth up to a D ♯ . After this supertonic scale degree is reached, a fast and repetitive pitch wave is generated, which increases its depth quickly as the music leads toward the next section. The aesthetic effect of this whole process is what Austin Patty calls the “struggle scenario,” when the rate of change slows down but intensification still increases ( Patty 2009 , 329–39). As this happens, listeners are being oriented to expect a climactic drop immediately afterwards. The first time, at 1:45, the music instead dramatically shifts to a low-energy breakdown section. Then, after an extended buildup, the true drop and climax of the track finally happens at 3:15, after this process occurs for a second time. Example 13 .

It seems to have an anacrustic function throughout the track, leading up to important sectional markers, often where new elements are introduced to the texture, as is typical for a core section. Therefore it can be interpreted as a process that orients listeners to the formal and metrical structure of the track. The decreasing-accelerating shape creates a sense of dropping or falling faster and faster, like the acceleration of gravity, which helps the process feel anacrustic and goal oriented. However, the track is unusual in that these orienting pitch slides that would normally be ascending are instead descending. If a listener is hearing the track for the first time, the descending pitch slide might at first sound misleading and disorienting in relation to the formal structure, but might then be reinterpreted as an orienting marker in later iterations.

This most commonly occurs in the formal part of the track called a breakdown, which is characterized by low sonic energy and a thin musical texture ( Snoman 2019 , 332). Often, some or all drum parts are absent from breakdown sections, meaning that keeping the beat becomes the responsibility of the dancers instead of the performers. In EDM, the drums (especially the kick drum) are the backbone of the music. They provide stability and articulate the beat, so when they are taken away, a sense of instability is created. In these situations syncopated rhythms are often heard without clear reference points to put them in context. Continuous processes often add to this sense of instability by making melodies or rhythms unclear or obscured. For example, if short, repeated continuous processes are particularly salient (as when wide vibrato is applied to a melody), they can distort the discrete melodies and rhythms and contribute to an aesthetic of disorientation. This aesthetic is important because it provides a break from the constant repetition in other sections. In live performance settings, disorientation also provides dancers with opportunities to physically rest, visually interact with the DJ, and perhaps “trip out” with the aid of drugs ( Vitos 2017 ).

In the breakdown section (2:03–2:59), the main synth line of the piece, which articulates eighth notes (what would be triplet eighth notes in 4 4 time) and its accompanying chords both hold over from the core, but the drums (on dotted quarter notes) and the bass (which provides a triple-meter feel with quarter notes in 8 12 , creating metrical dissonance) are notably absent.

In other words, even though it sounds like they have sustained notes changing every two measures on the downbeats (which helps provide some consistency and a sense of hypermeter), each chord swells continuously up and down in volume, creating rhythmic effects without re-articulation. The rhythm created by the tremolo effect is also not very clear. Sometimes it seems to be emphasizing each beat of the measure with its peak volume, and other times it seems to emphasize what would be “off beats” in simple meter (as in 4 4 time). Other times it is not clear at all what rhythm the tremolo effect is supposed to create with its pulsations. Example 15 (the amplitude graph from near the end of the section, when the chords are featured alone without the accompanying rhythmic synth) shows that panning is also utilized significantly and seemingly randomly, which could be why the rhythms generated by the tremolo effect sound so unclear.

Stage one is the first six measures of the section (2:03–2:15), when the synth is heard with a regular timbre, clear pitch, and clear rhythm, as it was in the previous sections of the track. Over the next ten measures (stage two, 2:15–2:33) numerous continuous processes are used to alter this sound layer. Its timbre is changed, becoming filled with more frequencies so that no single pitch is clearly defined. Another sound also fades in and articulates a rhythm of displaced eighth notes, halfway in-between the others, creating a resultant rhythm of sixteenth notes. This is a technique that can be described as the “illusion of acceleration,” since it seems as if the rhythm is speeding up but it is actually caused by a crescendo in a different rhythmic layer ( Smith 2019 , 54–56). (20) Then it seems as if delay and echo effects are used to complicate the rhythm even further, so that not only is the pitch unclear but also the rhythm is muddled. Volume changes are also used on this sound layer at the same time. The result is that in the middle of this breakdown section numerous continuous processes are being used as effects to create confusion. Stage three (2:33–2:49) is just a fade out, in which the main synth line from the texture is gradually removed so that the tremolo effect in the chords is highlighted and the return of the eighth notes in the synth in the next section is made more powerful.",

As shown in the transcription ( Example 18 ), the downbeat is clearly articulated by a stable bass note, but the other beats contain many short ascending pitch slides (scoops). In addition to the scoops between each pair of sixteenth notes, the starting and ending points of each short scoop continuously get higher. Thus, there are two scale levels of pitch slides going on here: one that takes place repeatedly over half a beat, and one that takes place over three beats. Both of these scoops are ornamentations of the main melodic figure that loops in most of the track, including all the core sections.",

Each ascending and descending cycle of the wave can be thought of as one short continuous process. As was the case in “Imaginary Friends” (Examples 4 and 5), the shorter processes are embedded within a longer one, since the short pitch waves transform over the course of the buildup section. Firstly, the speed of the wave cycles increases through acceleration, and secondly, the pitches at the high and low points of the wave continuously ascend. The continuous pitch ascents at two different levels of length (such that shorter scoops are embedded within a longer ascent), mimic the processes in the main loop transcribed in Example 18. The buildup section features an expanded version of this technique. The continuous acceleration, combined with the ascending frequencies (including an ascending noise sweep), orients listeners by signaling that this section is a buildup. After the one-beat cue of “woo!” the first core section begins.",

In the first part of the breakdown (2:45–3:00) only two rhythmic layers are present. One melodic motive from the core holds over. This repeated vocal hook (“be strong”) is the hook of the song, which comes in during the first of every four measures and fades out continuously over the next three. (28) This is yet another continuous process that contributes to the instability valued in breakdown sections. Example 19 .

The shape of the waves seems to indicate exponential growth for the ascending part and exponential decay for the descending part, as shown in the spectrogram ( Example 19 ). The filter sweeps continuously change the timbre and the volume of the sounds, making up-and-down swells, with the peak of each wave generating a rhythmic pulsation. This creates mostly clear rhythms that are metrically dissonant with the non-sounding but still-internalized beat. (29) But since the drums are not present for eight whole measures (2:45–3:00), the beat is easy to lose, and the continuous processes contribute to a sense of disorientation. When the drums come back in at 3:00 for the second half of the breakdown, the meter of the track is re-clarified. However, the continuous filter sweeps are still prominent and now create explicit metrical dissonance with the sounding reference points of the drums.",

After fifteen measures and three beats of salient continuous processes in this buildup section, there is a one-beat break that features the vocal cue of just an excited “woo,” signaling the upcoming beat drop and the start of the final core in the track, when the tension is released and climax is achieved.

We can make predictions about where they will lead based on previous patterns and our expectations, but it is not until the change stops and our predictions are fulfilled at the moment we expect (or slightly after we expect) that a climactic moment of release happens ( Huron 2006 , 322–26).

Short processes that function as ornamentation often occur in core sections, and they help listeners interpret rhythms and melodies so they can dance to them with appropriate timing. Breakdown sections often feature disorienting continuous processes that are hard to interpret within the normal meter and tempo on the dance floor, which communicates to dancers that they can take a break. In buildup sections (and sometimes in other places), continuous processes such as uplifters and downlifters orient listeners by leading them to and from structural markers so they can coordinate their bodies to the beat again. Even though the continuous processes in buildup sections have musical tension, it is caused by a sense of expectation, such that the continuous processes orient listeners and they know what to expect. Continuous processes are a crucial part of how contemporary EDM is experienced, and they contribute to the alternation of tension and release that fans and producers of this music are referring to when they speak about riding emotional waves.",

In both club settings and workout sessions, people talk about the music moving them “up and down” and giving them a boost of energy at specific points ( DeNora 2000 , 89–102; Solberg 2014 ; Solberg and Jensenius 2016 ). These situations happen when listening to EDM because of the intense climaxes experienced and continuous processes that precede them.

In fact, the term EDM is increasingly used less as an umbrella term for all electronic dance music and more as a specific term for mainstream, “radio-friendly” dance music based on the genres of trance and progressive house ( Jóri 2021 , 31–34; Wright 2017 , 25–26).
