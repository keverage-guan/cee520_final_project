One might also question if I am the best person to \nreview Decentering Music . Korsyn’s work has been influential upon my own \nresearch, and I may appear too closely tied to these ways of thinking to offer a \nsufficiently impartial perspective. (3) These obstacles, however, are not crippling \nto my endeavor because I have no intention of offering a traditional review. \nRather, in light of much of the substantive work that has already been written \n(and with which I will assume the reader’s familiarity), I feel it is more productive at this point in the history of the \nbook to comment on its reception.",

A mixed reaction is not unusual by any means, but many of \nthe reviewers of Korsyn’s book seemed a bit more polarized than normal. There \nwas little or no consensus regarding some very general issues, like the overall \ncontribution of the book to the field based on the historical relevance of its \narguments or an accepted understanding of the current state of musical \nscholarship. I began asking how one book could be interpreted so differently. \nThe provocative and seemingly controversial ideas presented in Decentering Music have been warmly embraced by some scholars while unequivocally dismissed by \nothers. It then occurred to me that, better than regurgitating many of the \npoints already made, it would be more interesting to explore how and why \ncritical reactions to this book have proved so divergent. In this sense, I offer \na review of the reviews, or perhaps a meta-review—a task that aligns with the \nspirit of Decentering Music .",

In perhaps the most \nnegative response, Peter Williams concludes, “It seems to me that the ‘crisis’ \nin higher music study as understood and outlined by Korsyn—the ‘struggle among \nfactions that compete for the cultural authority to speak about music’ and \n‘scholarly production [that] is forcing discourse towards increasing \nuniformity’—is only fostered by such a book as this. I am not sure what would be \nlost by simply ignoring it.” (4) While Williams encourages us to ignore Decentering Music altogether, Lawrence Kramer endorses it on the jacket cover to the \npaperback edition, “Anyone interested in the state of the musicological art \nshould find the arguments impossible to ignore.” (5) Likewise, Elizabeth Hellmuth \nMargulis finds the book, “. . . intriguing, maddening, and eminently worth \nreading.” (6)",

Korsyn’s timely book poses provocative questions and is a useful \nstarting point for engaging with questions about interdisciplinary scholarship \nand how it interacts with the professional world that surrounds and, on many \nlevels, influences it.” (7) But this reaction is sharply contrasted by Ruth Solie, \nwho dismisses the book almost entirely based on her belief that Decentering \nMusic , “ . . . is an elegy for troubles that have by now largely resolved themselves.” (8) To a far less severe degree than Solie, Patrick McCreless criticizes the book \nalong the lines that many of the issues Korsyn raises have been addressed in \nprevious scholarship.

                "text": "[5] Moving deeper, McCreless and Phyllis Weliver try to take Korsyn on at his \nown game, using the tools of critical theory to turn criticism back on the book. \nBoth attempt to understand Decentering Music in terms of its discursive mode, \nbut again, there seems to be a level of discord in how the two authors read the \ntext. McCreless, for instance, considers Decentering Music as embodying one of \nNorthrop Frye’s four archetypes of plot narrative (romance, comedy, tragedy, and \nsatire)—a strategy adopted by Korsyn in his critique of musical scholarship (see \nChapter 3). Although McCreless briefly considers the book as a romance, he \nspends a considerable amount of time explaining Korsyn’s narrative strategy as, \nmore or less, a scholarly comedy, featuring Korsyn as the protagonist, in which a crisis unfolds and finally reaches some level of resolution. (10) Meanwhile, Weliver uses another of Korsyn’s analytical tools, Hayden White’s \ntheory of tropes (metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony), to interpret the \nmode of discourse. She argues that Korsyn misunderstands his own position when \nhe suggests a “certain irony” in the book. Rather, she feels that, “Korsyn’s \nthesis repeatedly returns to the desire for knowledge and insight—a continual \nprocess, a spinning out that resists closure, similar to definitions of metonym, \nnot irony.” (11) [6] I hope the reader is starting to get a sense of the dramatically opposed \ninterpretations of Decentering Music . Is it a scholarly comedy, \nresulting in an \noutdated “elegy” we should simply ignore? Or, is it a metonym based on imaginative tools of literary criticism \nwhose timely arguments are impossible to ignore? I will suggest that not to read \nthis book is to disregard one of the most provocative pieces of critical \nliterature since Joseph Kerman’s Contemplating Music . As the similarities \nbetween the titles suggest, the mutual aim of each book is to change the field of \nmusical scholarship, and any book that attempts such a feat is not to be missed. McCreless recognizes Korsyn’s bold intent to change the field, “The book is thus \nmore than a little ambitious. But its ambition is backed up by a formidable \nintellect: Korsyn has an impressive command of musical scholarship of many \nstripes, and he brings to his task a formidable working knowledge and \nunderstanding of critical theory in the humanities outside the disciplines of \nmusic.” (12) The reception of Decentering Music is also paralleled by that of Contemplating Music , which was quite controversial, possibly more than scholars \nrecognize or remember, when it came out in 1985.",

                "text": "[7] I have a difficult time finding Korsyn’s ideas outdated. Perhaps because he \nengages dialogues between “old” and “new” musicology, reviewers may have assumed \nthat he is talking about the “old” vs. “new” with the intention of giving one of \nthese perspectives the authority to speak. But what Korsyn actually discusses is the \npluralism that these arguments have generated and the lack of critical \nengagement in the \nsubdisciplines. (13) And this hasn't been talked about. The \ncriticism that Korsyn is addressing “old” vs. “new” musicology in the same way \nas authors in the 1990s or earlier overlooks the fact that those arguments \nsought to undermine the status quo of the “old” and situate the “new” musicology \nas a valid scholarly perspective. Korsyn is considering what has happened since \nthe \n“new” musicology has been fully granted a seat at the table. He does not affirm \nor reject one of these partisan sides, but, more significantly, explores the \n“decentering” complicity of opposing perspectives. The discussion in Chapter 3 \nabout Kerman and Kofi Agawu most readily demonstrates this, but it is a \ncontinuous thread throughout the entire book. Others, like Mitchell Morris, seem \nto agree that the conflicts of the 1990s have continued to linger in frustrated \nways, “Musicological tempers were short in the ‘90s, and only recently seem to \nhave settled into a sullenness that still occasionally flares into the rancor.” (14) For these reasons and in light of recent related publications by Jairo Moreno \nand articles by Paul Attinello and Rose Rosengard Subotnik in Beyond Structural \nListening? Postmodern Modes of Hearing (2004), these issues are far from being \ndecades old. (15)",

This is not to suggest that all reviews should engage a book in the \nsame way, but here, I am tempted to consider some of them along further \nKorsynian lines, in light of the “Tower of Babel” metaphor Korsyn uses to describe the \nfactionalization of musical scholarship. For example, a more conservative \nscholar like Williams argues from an outside perspective, viewing the book as an \nappropriation of inconsequential “litcrit,” wasting time by talking about how we \ntalk about music. Given his opinion that we should ignore Decentering Music , it \nis probably safe to assume that he questions why one would bother with this sort \nof scholarship at all. Meanwhile, a more progressive scholar like Solie sees it \nas an attack on “new” musicology, and defends it in these terms. Korsyn, \nhowever, criticizes the “new” musicology from within; he uses the methods of \n“new” musicology to direct criticism back on itself (while critiquing “old” \nmusicology as well). I think that one of the underlying reasons scholars have \nread Decentering Music so differently is that many of the ideas presented in it \nundermine their own positions. To accept these arguments is to accept a \nvulnerability of one’s own authority to speak, and this can make people very \nuncomfortable. We fight back using our familiar weapons of scholarly production \n(“old” or “new”), but this generates another “Tower of Babel.”",

                "text": "[9] It is also interesting that some of the criticisms of Decentering Music are \nanticipated in the book itself, which often attempts to predict the negative \nresponses it evokes. Solie comments that, “ . . . for all the polemical use Korsyn has made in \nthe previous chapter [Chapter 3] of the writings of ethnomusicologists, this \nchapter takes entirely for granted a musical ‘composition’ in the European \ntradition, an object that can be represented and partitioned and discussed in \nstable spatial terms; it makes no reference whatsoever—nor does it allow for \nsuch reference—to any tradition in which music is conceived as experience or \nbehaviour rather than object, in which no stability of referent is assumed nor \nPlatonic form imagined.” But Korsyn appears to expect this type of criticism at \nthe beginning of Chapter 4, “The Objects of Musical Research (1).” He writes, \n“Anthony Easthope has suggested a productive solution to this dilemma by \ninvoking Saussure’s distinction between signifier and signified. A text has a \nrelative identity as a collection of signifiers that can be transmitted in \nmaterial form and repeated over time, but the signifieds can change . . . Easthope’s \nremarks illuminate not only literary texts but also all allographic arts, that \nis, all arts that depend on realization and exist in multiple performances. To \nspecify the identity of anything that is subject to repeated performances, \nsomething must persist through all the different versions, remaining the same \nthrough time. But this invariant element is not a Platonic idea or essence, it \nis a set of signifiers. Thus even an electronic piece that exists in only one \nversion would have only a relative identity, because its signifieds are also \nsubject to change.” (16) The refutation of competing ideas and criticisms as the book \nprogresses is a refreshing strategy. Korsyn is fully aware that his own position \ncan be deconstructed as easily as he deconstructs others, and he takes great \nefforts to address how his arguments can be turned on himself.",

McCreless disagrees with Korsyn’s assessment of the state of musical \nresearch, “Most pointedly, I simply don’t accept the ‘crisis,’ as it is \ninstantiated in Korsyn’s Tower of Babel—neither the claim as to when it happened \nor is happening, nor the claim as to how dire it is.” (17) On the other hand, Weliver \nbelieves, “The pioneering thought displayed in Decentering Music is so valuable \nbecause it can initiate larger discussion during a period when the international \nmusic research community faces visible threats. The ‘crisis’ is not just \nexternal but internal. We do need to rethink how we practice criticism and what \nour professional practices are; opening up is much more desirable that closing \ndown.” (18) Weliver finds the crisis multi-faceted, while McCreless denies there is a \ncrisis. So, are we in a crisis or aren’t we? Korsyn speaks of the “crisis” of \ndiscourse in musical scholarship, and, indeed, the disagreements about the “crisis” and \nthe contrasting ways scholars have read the book seem to affirm its existence. \nWhen Pascall concludes that Decentering Music will provide a “brighter \nmusicological world . . . as a result of this brilliant, profound, compelling and \nimportant book,” and Furhmann believes, “ . . . one will not easily find a more \nintelligent and discriminatingly thoughtful discussion partner than Korsyn, who \ndespite all commitment to a position never argues pro domo,” but Solie sees it \nas “Musicologists Behaving Badly” (a reference to the Oxygen network’s comedy \nseries, “Girls Behaving Badly,” in which women play practical jokes on \nunsuspecting people), something seems wrong. (19) Of course, disagreement is the \nbackbone of scholarship, but we can’t seem to agree on some very basic things, \nlike the current state of our own discipline or relevant topics for scholarly \npursuit. How can respected, accomplished scholars find the book so completely \ndifferent in so many ways? If these varied reactions do not, themselves, \nindicate the “crisis” Korsyn is talking about, it is at least, for me, \nconfusing. It also suggests that the book is worthy of serious contemplation by \nall in the field; our most important works tend to generate this type of \npolarized response.",

Korsyn’s ideas may \nalso find relevance beyond musicology, ethnomusicology, and music theory. I have \nfound certain concepts applicable to the field of music composition, and in her \nreview, Margulis makes a number of insightful extensions of Korsyn’s ideas in \nrelation to the field of music psychology and cognition.

                "text": "[12] In 1991, the field of Ethnomusicology was undergoing a restructuring of its \nmost basic disciplinary commitments, similar to the “old” vs. “new” musicology \ndebates that were flourishing in Theory and Historical Musicology. Judith Becker \ndescribed this paradigm shift through a story from Clifford Geertz’s The \nInterpretation of Cultures , “The story goes like this: There is an Indian story—at least I heard it as an Indian story—about an \nEnglishman who, having been told that the world rested on a platform which \nrested on the back of an elephant which rested in turn on the back of a turtle \nasked . . . what did the turtle rest on? Another turtle. Another turtle? ‘Ah, Sahib, after that it is turtles all the way down.’” (21) Becker challenged the supplanting of traditional ideas of ethnomusicology by \nshowing that, “Perspectivism forbids us to claim the last word, as the turtle \nstory precludes a final turtle.” (22) If the “new” stood on equal footing with the \n“old,” it was supported by its own foundational shell. Since this time, we have \ndiscovered and discussed a lot of turtles. Instead of adding another, Korsyn \nseems to saying that there are no turtles—an idea that, however unsettling, \nsuggests a new and exciting outlook for musical scholarship.",
