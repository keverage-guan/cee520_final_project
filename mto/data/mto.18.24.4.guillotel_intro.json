    "abstract": "The articles collected here were part of a one-day thematic session held during the7th European Music Analysis Conference(Leuven, Belgium, September 17–20, 2014). The session was dedicated to current understandings of tonality, particularly recent European perspectives and their connections to historical theory. Despite differences in methods and aims, the contributions here engage in dialogue by identifying specific research traditions and approaches—ranging from hermeneutical philosophy to neostructuralism—and by addressing characteristics of tonality. Three main threads run throughout: (1) the directional tendency of chord progressions; (2) centricity; and (3) hierarchical organization. Together, the perspectives adopted suggest that progress in the understanding of tonal language depends on a continuing dialectic between the theoretical discourse of the past and modern tools and models—including analysis of large corpora.",

If the passionate debates about tonality have faded, the understanding of tonality as a system and as a historical phenomenon nevertheless remains topical. The tabula rasa announced by dodecaphonism and the Darmstadt school in the mid-twentieth century was not realized, and the linguistic imperialism of tonality has not lost its influence, either in art music or in popular repertoires. The questions that seemed critical in the artistic and political context of the post-war years—when was the birth of tonality? In what geographical sphere? And in which cultural context?—produced answers and spurred evolution in investigative techniques that opened new fields of research. Among these are the structural organization of pretonal corpora and their relation to common practice; the identification of tonal coherence in the repertoires at the other end of the historical continuum, which are situated a priori outside tonality; and the historical theorization of writing techniques and the significance of this for our current understanding of tonality.",

If tonality seems unquestionable and if it is considered by some scholars as “the only habitable planet discovered so far” ( Tymoczko 2011 , 393), it nevertheless seems pointless to attempt agreement on even a general definition. The reasons for this paradoxical situation are numerous. First among them is the mutability of tonality, considered not only from a historical perspective but also from an achronic point of view. Tonality is neither a static construction nor is it confined to the musical substance itself; rather, it is an immaterial construction that rebuilds in each synchronic stratum and each individual work.",

(4) The presentations, the ensuing discussions, and the roundtable organized at the end of the session highlighted the diversity of traditions and approaches that characterize research on tonality today. At the same time, they drew attention to differences in the research traditions on the subject. While true for research on tonality within Europe, this applies especially to the transatlantic musicological dialogue. If American research is not sufficiently taken into account by European musicology, the reverse seems at least equally true: research currently conducted in Europe on the history and the organization of tonality is scarcely known in North America. These considerations, along with a decision by the two North American panelists to withdraw their papers from this collection, have fostered the idea of focusing on European perspectives on tonality, its organization, and its history.

The “poetics of doubt” ( Christensen 2016b ) cultivated by Dahlhaus ( 1967 ) deeply challenged disciplinary certainties. Dahlhaus’s approach opened up new avenues of reflection by showing that theoretical positions, whether historical or contemporary, are never neutral but are based on more or less obvious conditions of truth. The systematic questioning of what we think we know about tonality and its theories and the favoring of a potentially endless dialogue on the possible interpretations of the historical and cultural heritage—the musical works and the theoretical writings—are disconcerting and may seem unnecessarily complicated. Still, this general approach, applied in some contributions here, does not restrict itself to highlighting the inconsistencies or weaknesses of previous or contemporary points of view. On the contrary, it takes into account the content of the theorems encountered by reconsidering them and renewing them in the light of our own truth conditions, premises, and dogmatic positions.",

It was the proximity with linguistics, structuralism, and semiology, however, that exerted the strongest influence on the theorization of tonality during the last three decades of the twentieth century. Nicolas Ruwet’s theory of segmentation ( 1966 ), based on repetition and transformation, and the semiological model of Jean Molino ( 1975 ), opened new perspectives for investigating the logic and meaning of tonal language. Jean-Jacques Nattiez ( 1975 ), Célestin Deliège ( 1984 ), and Nicolas Meeùs ( 1992 ) refocused research on the exploration of the work’s internal structures and significance, drawing attention to the fact that the analysis of musical syntax implies a semiological dimension and showing that intrinsic musical meanings—like the meaning of harmonic units—are essentially context-dependent. The theory of harmonic vectors ( Meeùs 2000 ), to which several articles of this collection refer, is one important result of these currents of thought. (6)",

The reception of Schenker and his theories in post-war Germany, for example, is very different from the Schenkerian orthodoxy that emerged through the readings and translations of the North American school. The German reception sketched paths that the theory of the fundamental structure could have taken but that were ultimately abandoned in favor of a mainstream musicology ( Schwab-Felisch 2005 ). The situation is again different in France, where Schenker’s ideas—virtually unknown until the end of the 1970s—were first presented in an amended version ( Deliège 1984 ) and then introduced by means of a more faithful translation of Der freie Satz ( Schenker 1993 ). This assimilation of Schenker’s writings differs from the Anglophone reception by a less unified approach and by different, sometimes closer, relations to the original, and is reflected in this collection through implicit and explicit references to Schenkerian theory. The contributors also explore theories hitherto almost unknown to the international musicological community because their sources remain largely inaccessible. This is the case for the first detailed English-language description of the Tonfeldtheorie of Hungarian conductor and theorist Albert Simon.",

Although having their roots in Europe, neo-Riemannian tools were designed on North American ground at a particular moment in the history of musicology: when music analysis had to face critics of the Schenkerian postulate that makes tonal unity an essential aesthetic and ideological principle. By abstracting from tonal hierarchies and diatonicity, the transformational approach searched for a formalized and objective methodological answer to the analysis of repertoires that question tonal unity. While sensitive to the initial intentions and potential of neo-Riemannian theory, the research represented in this volume aims also at exploring the possible ways of integrating tools traditionally associated with tonal analysis—harmonic progressions and their relationship to diatonicity—to the transformational approach. Furthermore, the hermeneutical perspective reflects on how the reinterpretation of romantic theory in the light of transformational theory affects the way in which compositional techniques and the work’s underlying harmonic structures are understood. 2.

The ambition of the theory of harmonic vectors (THV) is to describe tonality without presupposing it and without projecting it on the work analyzed.

Is the criterion of the triad—beyond its importance from a vertical point of view—also relevant to the horizontal succession of harmonies, as Rameau suggests?

Meeùs stresses that it is essential to (re-)introduce the concept of tonicization in the THV so that it can provide a satisfactory explanation of tonality. Hugues Seress, on the other hand, proposes an extension of neo-Riemannian tools in order to identify tonal coherence at different structural levels. Both the THV and neo-Riemannian tools were developed in reaction to theoretical models focused on the tonic, either considered in relation to other harmonic functions or described from the point of view of its elaboration through different hierarchical levels. By deliberately ignoring centricity, the THV and neo-Riemannian tools have highlighted other, sometimes overlooked phenomena of syntactic coherence, and have extended the scope of analytical investigation to repertoires crossing the borders of tonality. At the same time, they have put aside a criterion formerly considered as essential for tonal coherence. The theoretical approaches in this collection testify to a need to maintain a methodological distance with regard to centricity while developing tools able to grasp and to describe it more accurately in different repertoires and at different structural levels. In doing so, they reflect both the key role of centricity for tonal coherence and its changing status in the history of music and its theories. 2.3. Hierarchical organization",

For Lachmann, both paradigms coexist despite their apparent antagonism, just as both approaches play a role in almost all analytical models. Taking as a point of departure the so-called Weitzmann regions—harmonic contexts implicitly or explicitly involving the augmented triad—Jessulat shows that the nineteenth-century Satzmodelle and modern transformational theories do not imply the same level of abstraction: the former focus almost exclusively on the foreground whereas the latter involve more abstract relations. Through scrutiny of theoretical sources by Weitzmann and Sechter and using examples from Brahms and Schubert as illustrations, the article shows that compositional techniques and their evolution are intrinsically linked to a change in perspective, namely, that chromatic alterations in the foreground become constitutive units and parts of a deeper and more abstract layer of harmony, and thus diatonic dissonant contexts evolve in an expanded chromatic setting.
