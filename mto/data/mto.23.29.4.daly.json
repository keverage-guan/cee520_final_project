    "abstract": "Contrapuntal direction—the principle that certain progressions may only occur through the motion of the contrapuntal voice towards a stable tenor—is a previously unrecognized implication of the teaching of the theorist and composer Johannes Tinctoris. Although Tinctoris’s interval successions are commonly the same whichever voice is the tenor, Tinctoris omits a small number of oblique progressions where the tenor would move. Although I will not investigate possible reasons for this omission, examples will show that when the missing progressions occur in repertoire, these can be explained by a reappraisal of the contrapuntal functions of the voices. The results extend Julie Cumming’s concept of the “movable module” and demonstrate its presence in music of the 1460s and 1470s. This principle emerges directly from a computer-assisted attempt to connect Tinctoris’s counterpoint with late-fifteenth century composition. Through its ability to recognise tenor function within a voice pair, to identify instances where the tenor function may have moved, or to mark voices that do not form a contrapuntal pair, directional analysis is able both to identify faulty analytical assumptions around voice pairing and to act as a validator of general theories of fifteenth-century compositional structure.",

The number of potential voice pairings present in four-voice texture make it difficult to describe composition in terms of the resolutely two-voice counterpoint teaching of the period. Contrapuntal direction—the principle that certain progressions are permitted only when the contrapuntal voice moves obliquely towards a stationary tenor—is a valuable tool in dealing with this conundrum, providing both a means of eliminating potential contrapuntal mispairings and a means of testing broader theories of polyphonic relationships. In the following, I demonstrate the value of contrapuntal direction to the analysis of cantus-firmus polyphony. Example 1 . Directional progressions collated from Book I, iv and Book I, vii of De arte contrapuncti , with the tenor shown in white notes (click to enlarge)",

                "text": "[0.2] The principle of contrapuntal direction emerges by inference from a handful of progressions in the 1477 De arte contrapuncti of Johannes Tinctoris (ca. 1435–1511). These progressions, collated from Book I and annotated in Example 1 , are unusual in that they do not simply illustrate consonance succession but also encode the contrapuntal functions of the voices. This encoding arises from the fact that Tinctoris permits these oblique progressions only when the contrapuntal voice moves and the tenor repeats its note. This is in marked contrast to other progressions from larger to smaller intervals such as fifth to third or octave to fifth ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, vi, viii), where the motion of the voices can be exchanged: the counterpoint may descend from an existing fifth to create a third against a stable tenor and the tenor may equally ascend to create a third against a stationary counterpoint. I call the effect shown in Example 1 “contrapuntal direction” and the specific examples “directional progressions” since, when formed according to De arte contrapuncti , the melodic motion of the contrapuntal voice will always move towards the tenor pitch. As a result, in any well-formed oblique progression from a sixth to a fifth or from a third to a unison, the stationary voice must be the tenor. The reason Tinctoris applied these directional restrictions is unclear, but must arise from a desire to maintain the contrapuntal identity of the tenor function, which he had defined in the Diffinitorium as “the foundation of the relationship in any composed song” ( Tinctoris ca. 1475 , xviii), (1) and had further described in De arte contrapuncti as “as holding [ tenens ] the counterpoint, which must be made following it, in some way subordinate to itself” ( Tinctoris 1477 , I,ii.). (2) The principle of contrapuntal direction is simply a manifestation of this subordination.",

First, the tenor function is usually identifiable through its traditional home in the tenor part, its presentation in long note values, and its use of known melodic material, often enshrined in the title of the composition. Another means of identifying the tenor seems redundant. Further, direction does not provide an immediate answer to the question posed above as to which voice should be paired with the tenor in contrapuntal analysis in the first place.",

More important even than this local diagnostic value, however, is contrapuntal direction’s ability to act as a validator of a general theory of contrapuntal relationships; if breaches of direction are a result of mispairing of voices, then a theory of pairings that produces few or no breaches is more likely to be correct. 1.

Some of the importance of this text arises from the way that Books II and III examine subjects such as dissonance handling and musical rhetoric that are absent from most teaching material of the period ( Luko 2008 , 107–112), though here I will concentrate on Book I, which provides the basic consonance succession formulae. Tinctoris organizes Book I of De arte contrapuncti in a logical manner that provides a performer singing super librum with a set of coordinates to use as a guide to improvisation ( Berger 2015 , 259–63).  An improvising singer, knowing that the present consonance is a sixth and wishing to follow with an octave, may use the list of progressions shown in Example 2 to match the observed motion of the tenor and make the corresponding contrapuntal motion in response. (The example provides an exhaustive list of the ways Tinctoris allows a singer to move from an upper sixth to an octave ( 1477 , I, vii.)). The singer may then extend the improvisation by taking the newly established octave as an opening consonance, selecting a fresh destination interval and repeating the process.",

Tinctoris does not connect two-voice counterpoint with composition in three or more voices, other than by implication, to observe that the fourth and, to a much lesser extent, the sixth rely on a third voice for their consonance ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, v,vii; Canguilhem 2016 , 165–67). Basic compositional structures such as cadence are mentioned only in passing: cadences rely on perfect consonance ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, ii) or are appropriate places for decorative dissonance ( Tinctoris 1477 , II, v, xxiv). Tinctoris does employ cadences in his illustrations, but a minimal definition of cadence itself is reserved for the Diffinitorium ( Tinctoris ca. 1475 ; Schwind 2009 , 2–3). Example 2 reflects both these tendencies. The second progression presents the unembellished cadential motion from sixth to octave common to many of the succeeding citations from repertoire, but Tinctoris only remarks that this progression is common, while the third and fourth progressions are rare in two-voice counterpoint. Further, the example seems to embody an unstated principle: similar motion to a perfect consonance is permitted (albeit rarely) when the tenor descends, but not when it ascends. (3) Tinctoris, then, does not provide a list of rules for simple counterpoint as in Fuxian first species, but rather satisfies Klaus-Jürgen Sachs’s minimal definition of counterpoint as a system for organizing consonance succession ( Sachs 1974 , 57–60). He does this by seemingly providing all needed progressions within an organizing framework of starting consonance, following consonance and tenor motion.",

Morgan first finds five explicit principles which largely define the ambit within which Tinctoris operates, but also prohibit parallel perfect intervals and impose the restriction on sixth-to-fifth motion that produces the first two progressions of Example 1 ( Morgan 2016 , 45). He further identifies a set of nine implicit principles that govern which progressions Tinctoris provides and which are not ( Morgan 2016 , 46). These principles are significant since Morgan seems at first to challenge the notion, previously widespread ( Berger 2005 , 141–43; Fuller 2002 , 498–99), that Tinctoris’s set of progressions is exhaustive, noting that De arte contrapuncti includes only 768 of 935 notionally available progressions ( Morgan 2016 , 9–10). The nine implicit principles, however, account for this discrepancy ( Morgan 2016 , 162–63). Example 3 . Tinctoris’s illustration of general sixth usage (click to enlarge) Example 4 .

(4) Morgan further notes the restricted range of motion Tinctoris allows from the sixth in all circumstances, identifying it as an implicit contrapuntal principle ( Morgan 2016 , 46). This restriction may stem from Tinctoris’s view of the sixth as a quasi-dissonance in two voices: ‘it has more of harshness than sweetness’ ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, vii), and he provides not only the permitted progressions but also an example of good usage. This example, given as Example 3 , shows sixths moving in parallel and to octaves and tenths. He does allow a general exception, however, for the sequences 5–6–5, 8–6–5 and 5–6–8, as shown in Example 4 . Tinctoris handles the sixth with unusual care and, when combined with Morgan’s insight into the underlying principles at work, this reinforces the conclusion that the forms of Example 1 where the tenor would move are not omitted, but rather excluded.",

This examination of the contrapuntal background is necessary, however, since the comprehensive nature of De arte contrapuncti is the foundation of my analysis. The usefulness of contrapuntal direction as a diagnostic tool relies on the exhaustive nature of De arte contrapuncti . If Tinctoris omits progressions that he finds acceptable, it is unsafe to assign any significance to the absence of the reversed forms of the motions in his teaching (see Example 1). On the other hand, if Tinctoris does provide all possible progressions consistent with his unstated principles of counterpoint, then the exclusion of the oblique motions from sixth to fifth and third to unison where the tenor voice moves must be significant, the more so because the result of the exclusion is to prohibit a set of progressions with the same sounding result as others he permits. Explaining this curious state of contrapuntal affairs is left to the future; here I simply attempt to exploit it. 2. Aims and method",

This aim was based on Tinctoris’s own assertion that formal composition ( res facta ) depended on the same technique as singing super librum ( Tinctoris 1477 , II, xxi), a point made by theorists as distant as Prosdocimus and Lusitano ( Prosdocimus [1412] 1984 , 32–33; Canguilhem 2011 , 94).

Where an improvising singer might use the example to ask, “Given that I’m singing a sixth and want to sing an octave next, how should I respond to the observed motion of the tenor?,” the sieve re-collated the progressions in order to ask, “Given the present interval and the motion of the tenor, what contrapuntal continuations are available?” The sieve then extracted a given pair of voices from a mass movement, (5) one of which was assigned the function of tenor for the purposes of the experiment, and segmented the movement based on a combination of notated values in the designated tenor function modified by Ruth DeFord’s concept of compositional tactus ( DeFord 2015 , 82–84). The program then identified an initial consonance and filtered the florid notation of the following segment through the digital counterpoint in order to identify a contrapuntally significant consonance with the tenor. This note then formed a new opening consonance and the process repeated. This basic method is summarized in Examples 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 . (6)",

This sweeping standard further appealed because it catered to the simple design of the software, which analyzed a single voice pair from a movement-length sample without the ability to change mid-analysis.

Further, the sieve produced two forms of output that made it possible to examine the exceptions to this rule. The first was a simple list of locations in the source where no satisfactory contrapuntal solution could be identified. I refer to such cases as “contrapuntal anomalies.” The second was a form of score output that made it possible to identify the cause of each anomaly. Example 9 shows a short excerpt from the discantus-tenor voice pair taken from Caron’s mass, while Example 10 shows the result of passing this passage through the contrapuntal sieve with the tenor part assigned the tenor function. (8) The inner voices of Example 10 show a candidate contrapuntal reduction while the outer parts reproduce a form of the unfiltered notation. The rests in Example 10 show locations where the software was unable to find a contrapuntal solution based on De arte contrapuncti , matching the marked progressions in Example 9. In each case, examining the outer voices of the score at the point of the anomaly makes it clear that the anomaly arises from an apparent breach of the principle of contrapuntal direction: the tenor voice moves obliquely from a sixth to a fifth against a stable contrapuntal voice. Approximately half of all contrapuntal anomalies identified in the initial filtering of the L’homme armé masses arise from such directional causes. Of these, the majority arise from sixth-to-fifth motion, with oblique third-to-unison motion much less common.",

One hypothesis consistent with Tinctoris is to modify Sachs’s paradigm such that the discantus-tenor pair is simply the most common pairing of voices, with other combinations also possible. The question then becomes one of identifying how and when these pairings change in complex composition. A perfect solution to this problem would eliminate contrapuntal anomalies altogether and thus confirm Tinctoris’s statement that complex composition was built around simple counterpoint.",

This framework, potentially including the tenor function, may then migrate around the texture, employing different voice pairs at different times. Both the problem of locating this framework and the contrapuntal definition of the framework itself correspond closely to the direct contrapuntal relationship that I sought to identify within mass textures. While Cumming’s primary concern is the relationship between the two-voice framework and the whole rather than the nature of the counterpoint between specific voices, she proposed a number of criteria for identifying a shifting framework within complex composition. Contrapuntal direction has a particularly close interaction with Cumming’s methods of locating the two-voice framework, and I will return to this interaction and its implications below.",

In defining the difference between res facta and singing super librum , Tinctoris remarks of res facta “that all the parts of composed polyphony, be they either three or four or more, are mutually bound to each other, so that the order and law of concords must be observed of any part with respect to each and all . . . rdquo; ( Tinctoris 1477 , II, xxi). (9) What Tinctoris means by this mutual binding is unclear. At the least, it seems to require that written composition reduce to consonance in all voices, but the “order and law of concords” might equally imply a direct contrapuntal relationship should exist between all voices at once. Tinctoris provides an illustration of unusual length to accompany this statement, though this seems as much geared towards the comparative illustration of three-, four- and five-voice textures ( Whittaker 2016 , 254–59). Noticeable throughout, however, is that any vertical slice of a semibreve’s duration reduces comfortably to consonance. Examining the counterpoint of all four non-tenor voices against the tenor finds only two directional anomalies, suggesting a particular care to avoid these progressions. When considered in the context of Tinctoris’s usual compositional practice, these adjacent directional progressions are unusually interesting, and I will return to them in my conclusion. Example 11 .

The box over the second barline marks an apparent contrapuntal heresy. Okeghem, whose reputation for contrapuntal mastery would survive into Zarlino’s lifetime ( Zarlino [1558] 2010 , 243), has committed the basic error of creating parallel fifths between tenor and discantus. In other words, if the tenor and discantus are assumed to form a contrapuntal pair, Okeghem has broken the fourth of the explicit principles derived from Tinctoris by Morgan, the most explicitly-stated contrapuntal rule to appear in De arte contrapuncti ( Morgan 2016 , 29). Comparison with improvised practice shows that such consecutive fifths may be permitted, but only when made between pairs that do not include the “tenor” ( Berentsen 2014 , 238), and Tinctoris only allows them quamvis raro , where the voices either repeat or swap notes ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, vi.). Accepting a direct contrapuntal relationship between discantus and tenor in this passage requires the simultaneous acceptance of a schoolboy error on Okeghem’s part. Further, even when the discantus and tenor are not taken as a direct pairing, the presence of such a progression strongly suggests that full contrapuntal perfection is not required between all voices; the passage only works contrapuntally if the tenor and discantus are not paired at this point and if Tinctoris’s injunction merely requires basic consonance. Okeghem’s parallel fifths do suggest a basic analytical principle, however: that contrapuntal problems can be the result of misdiagnosed voice pairs. Breaches of contrapuntal direction are more common than parallel fifths and may be harnessed in the same way. 3. Case studies",

At the beginning of m. 4, as the tenor moves from C to D, it creates a contrapuntal anomaly by moving from a sixth to a fifth against the stationary A in the discantus. The presence of this anomaly suggests either that the tenor voice does not carry the tenor function in this excerpt or that, if it does, its partner is not the discantus. The example provides other reasons to think either might be the case. The tenor shows no sign of citing the L’homme armé melody while the bass quotes a slightly embellished version of the phrase associated with the words “L’homme armé doibt on doubter.” The descending fifth at the opening of the alto is another characteristic figure of the L’homme armé melody, and the alto is another candidate to bear the tenor function at this point. In fact, the tenor seems the least likely of all four voices to occupy the contrapuntal limelight in this passage. The directional anomaly between tenor and discantus supports these other inferences and suggests a need to look elsewhere for contrapuntal pairings. Example 13 .

If Tinctoris provides an accurate representation of the contrapuntal practice of the 1460s and 70s, the passage can only be explained in one of three ways: either the composer has deliberately ignored one of the explicit principles encoded in De arte contrapuncti , the tenor voice is not acting as a contrapuntal tenor at this point, or the discantus is not the tenor voice’s contrapuntal partner. Unlike the previous example from Regis, there is no obvious statement of the L’homme armé melody in this excerpt, though the tenor has recently stated the opening phrase in long note values. The apparent absence of the structural melody combined with all four voices exhibiting similar note values creates the maximum ambiguity in contrapuntal pairings, and so it is a relief at least to gather that the tenor-discantus combination is unlikely. The presence of the imperfect fifth between the voices in m. 3 of the example may also suggest this, though the persistently consonant nature of two-voice counterpoint makes it reasonable to think that the tenor’s E would simply be inflected if the two voices were in partnership.

                "text": "[3.4] The next case provides something that previous examples do not: the L’homme armé melody in the tenor. In the last section of his mass, Busnoys’s tenor quotes the melody in inversion, which has the effect of transferring the cantus firmus into the bass register. The motion of the tenor against the sustained D in the discantus of Example 14 represents exactly the progression from sixth to fifth by motion of the tenor that Tinctoris excludes. The entry of the discantus in the second half of m. 3 illustrates the danger of the basic assumption of a contrapuntal relationship between tenor and discantus. Given that the discantus reenters only at the end of the tenor’s phrase, there is no reason to believe that the tenor and discantus should form a contrapuntal pair at this point. In fact, there are good reasons to think otherwise. The G longa in the tenor marks the end of one phrase of the inverted L’homme armé melody, and Busnoys has marked this with a cadence, not between tenor and discantus, but between tenor and alto. The significance of this cadential formula is demonstrated by the way Busnoys terminates the following cantus firmus phrase, which concludes the entire mass, using the same formula.  Busnoys employs the same cadential melody, this time with the discantus and alto in their more typical roles ( Example 15 ). The only notable difference between the versions lies in  the embellishment of the final alto part with neighbor tones.",

(10) Tinctoris seemingly confuses the issue further with his one mention of clausula in De arte contrapuncti where he states, “This completion, however, is assumed for every middle or final cadence [clausula] of a piece of music to be regularly effected through a perfect concord, although an imperfect one is also occasionally taken in its place” ( Tinctoris 1477 , III, v). (11) Tinctoris supports this statement with an illustration that explicitly marks a number of cadences that avoid the creation of perfect consonance ( Example 16 ), though the example further supports Tinctoris’s previous assertion that the tenor may either ascend or descend to such a “perfection” ( Tinctoris 1477 , I, vi.).

The samples of Busnoys, Regis and Du Fay revealed no anomalies at all and Faugues showed a single non-directional anomaly. Regis is particularly striking in this regard, since the initial discantus-tenor sample identified him as the second most eccentric of the six composers, after Caron.

At the same time, the other voices in the texture move in longer note values while the alto descends into the tenor’s usual range and adopts the stepwise descent towards a cadential D; this is typical of the tenor in this mass, where the cantus firmus is often transposed down a fourth from its usual cadential focus on G. In short, the alto behaves more like a tenor than the tenor does. The alto is already closely associated with the tenor in this mass through the frequent semi-canonic relationship between the two voices, so a transfer of the contrapuntal tenor function to the alto part while the tenor sings Michael praepositus paradisi seems natural. Such a transfer would justify the curious tenor-discantus progression by implying instead a direct contrapuntal relationship between alto and discantus. The strong cadence between the upper voices at the conclusion of the excerpt reinforces this inference.

Curiously, Tinctoris’s attitude can first be inferred from his approach to composing for two voices in his own L’homme armé mass. Writing for a reduced ensemble in the early L’homme armé masses tends to take the form of a series of duets for any two-voice combination of discantus, alto and bassus with possibly a conclusion for all three voices. Such writing may take up an entire section such as in Tinctoris’s “Christe” and its equivalent in Busnoys’s mass, or act as an introduction to a four-voice passage, as in the same section of Du Fay’s mass. Further, these passages, whether imitative like Busnoys’s or not as with Du Fay, are typically built from chains of imperfect consonances that largely avoid note-against-note fifths ( Daly 2020 , 153–70). A curious characteristic of these duets is that they tend to create fifths by syncopation, using oblique motion from sixth to fifth to create an otherwise rare sonority. This reliance on oblique motion has the potential to create directional progressions when moving obliquely between syncopated parallel imperfect intervals. When the voices exchange roles in creating this oblique motion, as happens in Du Fay’s “Christe” ( Example 20 ), in the absence of a tenor voice, an apparent directional paradox occurs.

His “Christe” is unusual in involving the tenor in the duets but otherwise all seems normal: the opening tenor-bass phrase (not shown in the example) is in large part an embellished chain of parallel sixths while the following upper voice duet relies just as heavily on thirds. What is remarkable is Tinctoris’s care in avoiding the sort of directional contradictions present in Example 20. The two opening duets are both entirely free of directional anomalies, regardless of which voice in the duet is assigned the tenor function for the purposes of the analysis. At the very least, Tinctoris seems to have taken unusual care to avoid a problematic progression that routinely appears in the music of other composers.",

                "text": "[5.4] More interesting is that directional anomalies do arise in later duet pairs. These, however, only ever arise in one orientation within a given phrase, identifying each duet phrase as a highly embellished example of two-voice writing following Book I of De arte contrapuncti . One such anomaly arises from mm. 2–3 of Example 21 when the bass is read as the tenor function against the alto; another occurs between discantus and tenor in mm. 8 as the tenor moves from sixth to fifth against the stationary G of the discantus and another occurs between tenor and bass in both mm. 13 and 14 if the tenor is assigned its usual function, as the tenor moves obliquely from third to unison with the lower voice, though disguising this motion in each case with a passing note. These progressions identify the alto, discantus and bass as carrying the tenor function in turn. In the last case, the bass makes the matter obvious by citing a phrase of the L’homme armé melody almost without embellishment, making it plausible to read the earlier alto and discantus entries as embellished cantus firmus phrases as well. Tinctoris seems here to be playing with compositional form, shifting contrapuntal functions between voices and creating a structure that resembles a typical two-voice duet while in fact adhering to his own strict definition of contrapuntal propriety. This aspect of pursuing theoretical discourse by compositional means, of “composing in theory” as Emily Zazulia has described it ( Zazulia 2018 ), becomes perceptible here only through an awareness of directional principles.

                "text": "[5.5] Despite an unusual strictness apparent in his two-voice writing, Tinctoris retains the capacity to surprise. An important case comes from the five-voice example that forms part of De arte contrapuncti II, xxi. Using the sieve to examine the relationship between the tenor and each other voice returns only two anomalies, both directional. One, between the second contratenor part and the tenor, which seems to be a secondary relationship given the apparent cadential partnership between tenor and supremum shown in Example 22 . More striking is the clear directional anomaly as the tenor moves from B to C against the G of the supremum at almost the same point of the example. In purely directional terms, this passage is only correct counterpoint if the tenor function resides in the supremum. It requires almost an act of will to allow this possibility since the two voices seem to move in ways typical of tenor and counterpuntal voice, but the possibility cannot be excluded on the counterpoint alone in a passage that Adam Whittaker argues demonstrates the mobility of the tenor function ( Whittaker 2016 , 254–55). Tinctoris seems to have taken great care to avoid these sixth-to-fifth progressions where possible. In allowing two of these progressions side by side, in effect doubly declaring that the tenor does not provide the tenor function to either supremum or contratenor secundus, Tinctoris is implicitly making a point about the structure of his composition.",

                "text": "[5.6] This last example and the “Christe” of Tinctoris’s Missa L’homme armé point to both the benefits and challenges of using contrapuntal direction in analysis. On the local level, the principle may only be intermittently useful: analysis of a given phrase or passage depends largely on a small number of contrapuntal progressions whose presence or absence may simply be fortuitous. Similarly, the absence of directional anomalies in the opening two duets of the “Christe” may not be significant, though even on this scale contrapuntal direction is able to contradict an analytical assumption by finding progressions inconsistent with a specific contrapuntal pairing or orientation. As the sample size increases, however, consistent patterns of contrapuntal behavior become telling. As the “Christe” continues, Tinctoris writes counterpoint that implies that a specific voice holds the tenor function within any given phrase. The longer this pattern continues, the more likely this is to be by design. Further, contrapuntal direction can at times act as a marker of contrapuntal function, even where the pairing of voices is not in doubt. When taken across a sizeable body of repertoire, contrapuntal direction’s ability to test a theory of compositional construction by assessing the theory’s ability to eliminate directional anomalies provides a theoretical proving ground for fresh understandings of fifteenth-century compositional method.",
