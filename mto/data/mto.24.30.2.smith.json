    "abstract": "In popular and scholarly discourse on texted music and music-speech intersections, the prevailing assumption is that the linguistic features of the lyrics (e.g., syllabic stress) align with the way the lyrics are sung (e.g., phenomenal accent in or affecting the melody)—or, if not, that they should. However, not onlycantext and music conflict, but they do so in a variety of ways, to varying degrees, and with different effects on our listening experience. I defineprosodic dissonanceas any conflict between the prosodic linguistic features and musical rendition of text. This could include misalignment between syllabic and durational/registral stress, between spoken and sung phrases, or between spoken and sung intonation. Prosodic dissonance/consonance can also interact with rhyme, vowel shape, parallelism, and syncopation. To recognize prosodic dissonance, I (1) determine the prosody for the lyrics as spoken, (2) determine the prosody for the melody as sung, (3) identify mismatches as dissonances, (4) consider the effect of the surrounding melody/lyrics, (5) consider alternate pronunciations or hearings that might account for it, and (6) consider the perceptual and analytical implications. This article focuses on prosodic dissonance in popular music, with longer analyses of Kesha’s “Tonight” (2020), Royal & the Serpent’s “Overwhelmed” (2020), and Rina Sawayama’s “This Hell” (2022).",

(3) Defining and Perceiving Stress and Its Role in English Stress has always seemed to resist all attempts at definition: the closer one investigates the nature of stress, the more difficult it becomes to define. One of the reasons for this is that a stressed (or prominent) syllable is distinguished not only by acoustic features, but it is also a perceptual phenomenon, i.e., in defining it, one must account not just for its production, but also for its perception by the interlocutor.

(4) Spoken English differentiates between stressed and unstressed syllables, tending to use more pitch movement, more distinct vowel qualities, and longer durations for stressed syllables. Historically, English has been categorized as a “stress-timed” language, tending to evenly distribute stressed syllables in time regardless of the number of syllables between them (as opposed to “syllable-timed” languages such as Spanish or French, which more evenly distribute syllables regardless of stress).

Bertinetto ( 1989 ) provides a summary of this debate and offers “compressibility” as an improved means of distinguishing syllable stress distribution. Arvaniti ( 2009 ) argues that research on speech rhythm should be based on the same principles for all languages, proposing a focus on grouping and prominence. Cross-linguistic metric differences are not robust, and metric differences between different speakers and dialects of the same language can be substantial ( Arvaniti 2012 , Bertinetto 2021 ). Nevertheless, stress does seem to be a widely perceptible phenomenon, even in species other than humans ( Hoeschele and Fitch 2016 ), and despite dwindling evidence in favor of clear stress-timed/syllable-timed language categories, it does seem to vary between languages. Although individual speakers of a language may use a wide variety of stress metrics, stress can still inform whether we hear speech as foreign ( Patel 2010 ), and our native language can have both contextual and perceptual effects on how we hear stress, as in the “stress deafness” effect observed in native French speakers ( Degrave 2019 , Frost 2011 ).",

In both media, this patterning and grouping involves varying pitch and duration ( Wennerstrom 2001 , Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 ). Likely owing to the commonalities described above, some similar hierarchical analytical conceptions and visual representations of meter have been used for music, poetry, and speech. Among these are tree diagrams, poetic “feet,” and metrical grids, all capturing the potential for these modes of expression to suggest multiple layers of accent. (10) Examining more qualitative criteria, authors have shown that text painting and text setting are fruitful subjects for in-depth analysis of expression, genre, individual composers’ style, and narrative.

(12) However, not only can text and music conflict, but they do so in a variety of ways, to varying degrees, and with different effects on our listening experience. (13) I define prosodic dissonance as any conflict between a text’s prosodic linguistic features and its musical rendition. This could include misalignment between syllabic and melodic stress, between spoken and sung phrases, or between spoken and sung intonation. (14) Note that melodic stress refers to phenomenal accent rather than metric accent, meaning that prosodic dissonance is a distinct phenomenon from syncopation. Whereas syncopation describes the relationship between the meter and a given musical stream (e.g., the melody), prosodic dissonance describes the relationship between the melody and the text. For example, in Example 1, the syllable “-tion-” is not syncopated, but it is dissonant. I will explore some intersections and differences between syncopation and prosodic dissonance further below.",

English has some features that music lacks (at least explicitly), such as lexical categories, semantic content, and consonants/vowels. (15) Similarly, music has some components that language does not explicitly, such as multiple simultaneous streams and a high degree of repetition. What they do have explicitly in common is stress—the most natural avenue for prosodic dissonance in English. We might imagine a stress discrepancy space as shown in Example 1 , (16) where for any given moment, the more stress in the music (particularly the melody) compared to the less stress within the corresponding lyric, the more prosodically dissonant that moment will sound. Inversely, when the relative stress or accent levels between music and text align, the more prosodically consonant it will sound.",

Nevertheless, word stress has more potential for dissonance: For multisyllabic words, an unusually stressed word upends the prosody of the entire phrase (“I’m rea DING a book A bout music”), while increasing the relative emphasis of a word within the phrase can in some cases simply change the meaning (e.g., “ I’m reading a book about music; she’s reading something else”). (17) For this reason, word stress is usually involved in the sense of misalignment, but particularly uncommon or semantically irrelevant phrase emphasis can also evoke prosodic dissonance. The less common a word’s default stress within a phrase (e.g., “I have an idea”), the more likely it becomes that emphasizing it melodically would sound dissonant.",

Syllable stress cannot be absolutely quantified without flattening the variety and identity attached to language. Though there are “official” recognized pronunciations for individual words, available in dictionaries, textbooks, and public educational resources, it bears remembering that these accounts capture (at best) the pronunciation of the majority of speakers and (at worst) the pronunciation in the dialect(s) of those in power. There are overall trends in pronunciation at population levels that make the discussion still worthwhile—or mutual intelligibility would be more of an obstacle than it is—but keeping that in mind, I do not advocate for strictly quantifying prosodic dissonance. Rather, I prefer to frame the degree of dissonance or consonance comparatively, relative to the surrounding context—with the understanding that the analyst’s own speech will be reflected in their interpretations.

When sung, the lengths of syllables may be longer, with more flexible lengths. However, we still tend to hear longer notes, or longer inter-onset intervals (IOIs), as more stressed, and shorter notes or IOIs as weaker.

The repeated lyric “Baby, let the games begin” would be consonant with a musical setting placing “ba-,” “games,” and “-gin” on the longest (and if unsyncopated, metrically strongest) notes. Instead, Taylor Swift sings the syllables completely evenly, pausing only after “-gin.” The syllables “ba-” and “-gin” are consonant here, but the equal duration and (unsyncopated) metric placement facilitate hearing “the” rather than “games” as the accented syllable, creating a moment of dissonance. In addition to “the” occurring on the beat, what furthers this effect is not so much a lengthening of “the” as a relative shortening of “games.” If we recompose the excerpt with a longer duration of this syllable, as in Example 6 , the dissonance would be eliminated.

I call this prosodically dissonant isochrony , referring to the fact that the equal subdivisions of the melody (isochrony in the music-theoretical sense) conflict with the “equal” spacing of stressed syllables (isochrony in the linguistic sense). To illustrate this paradigm, compare the following excerpts from Dua Lipa, “Levitating” (2020) and Olivia Rodrigo, “good 4 u”(2021) ( Examples 7 and 8 ). I encourage the reader to speak the text to each example aloud before and after listening to the musical renditions. Dua Lipa’s verse aligns the “isochronies” of the text and the melody, placing “had,” “-ni-,” “fell,” “rhy-,” and “mu-” on the pitch changes (and on the beats, with no syncopation) and lengthening the longer words “don’t” and “stop.” By contrast, the stressed syllables “car” and “-reer” land on less musically stressed moments of Olivia Rodrigo’s phrase: the pitch accents, which reinforce rather than undermine the beats, seem to emphasize the unstressed syllable “ca-.” As with Example 5, the even spacing seems to “shorten” the syllables that would be lengthened in speech. Though Examples 7 and 8 both feature evenly subdivided melodies landing squarely on the beats, the rhythmic experiences of the two differ enormously through the lyrics. Prosodically dissonant isochrony provides a uniquely clear illustration of how our rhythmic experience changes with our linguistic expectations. (22) Prosodic Dissonance Litmus Test",

Given the first two steps, identify and interpret prosodic dissonance: Identify places where the most stressed spoken syllables match up with the most unstressed sung notes or vice versa. These are moments of prosodic dissonance. The stronger the contrast, the stronger the dissonance. If the moment in question does not sound prosodically dissonant, consider: Is there an alternate pronunciation of the text (e.g., contrastive stress, multiple accepted pronunciations), or an alternate hearing of the melody (e.g., different interpretation of the accent structure), that can account for the unexpected consonance?

With the definitions and variables in place, we can proceed to examine some intersections and interactions between prosodic dissonance and linguistic and musical features. 3.

In this process, vowels on weak syllables become more centralized in the mouth, most often becoming schwas. (24) Conversely, schwas are associated with weaker syllables. In fact, this may be the most aurally salient marker of stress/unstress in English, and intensifies difficulty understanding familiar words with shifted stress. (25) These sonic signals of “weakness” open up at least two possibilities for creating and/or intensifying the effect of prosodic dissonance: accenting a typically reduced vowel or creating a new schwa from a syllable not typically reduced.

In Lady Gaga’s English, the first and third syllables of the word “nostalgia” contain reduced vowels, with only the middle syllable emphasized: “nə-STAL-jə.” In her sung rendition, however, the pitch accent on the third beat lands on an unstressed syllable, creating prosodic dissonance. I argue that this dissonance is at least more noticeable, if not further intensified, by the melodic accent’s coincidence with a schwa.

The prechorus to 5 Seconds of Summer, “Easier”(2019) includes one moment where this occurs ( Example 11 ). At multiple points, Luke Hemmings reduces the vowel in the word “damn,” which would (particularly being an expletive) typically be emphasized in speech.

With the placement of musical (usually melodic) emphasis on typically unstressed syllables, weaker syllables and even reduced vowels become available for rhyming for expressive purposes. (26) This phenomenon is well documented in rap, where rappers sometimes use pitch, timing, or vowels to emphasize rhymes and create rhythmic variety. (27) However, it also occurs outside of rap, prosodically consonant contexts, and syncopated contexts as well. Example 12 shows an excerpt from a verse of Janelle Monáe, “Make Me Feel” (2018). Here, Janelle Monáe emphasizes the first syllables of “compression” and “confession” with pitch and timing, creating a rhyme between the weaker, typically vowel-reduced syllables “com-” and “con-.” (28) The words’ stressed syllables already rhyme, but that rhyme becomes secondary in the melodic context.

If the prosody changes while the melody does not, this has the potential to create prosodic dissonance through parallelism. Prosodic dissonance increases in salience and intensity when a stress pattern for a melody has already been established only to be changed on a subsequent reiteration. For highly repetitive melodies, this can also serve as a means for musical artists to add rhythmic variety through the text, even while maintaining consistency in other elements of the music.

The text also remains relatively constant in prosody: “I think about me now and who I could’ve been / And then I picture all the perfect that we lived.” Without the text, the third line sounds as an exact repetition of the first two; however, the lyrics change emphasis: “‘til I cut the strings on your tiny violin.” The lyrics’ emphasis moves from the fourth syllable (“the”) to the fifth (“strings”), creating prosodic dissonance through contrast with the previous lines and through the high-pitch, downbeat placement of “the.” One could imagine a recomposition of this passage to place the pitch accent on “strings,” creating a syncopation effect instead of prosodic dissonance ( Example 15 ). Even then, the effect of parallelism creates fertile ground for dissonance, particularly in comparison to the consonant end of the line, “tiny violin.” Interactions with and Differences from Syncopation Example 16 .

                "text": "[4.3] Previous scholars have documented a separate but related phenomenon regarding prosody and music: the use of syllable stress to create or reinforce syncopation ( Temperley 1999 , VanderStel 2021 ). (30) In both (stress-based) prosodic dissonance and syncopation, stress patterns misalign. However, as mentioned above, syncopation involves one or more musical layers (for our purposes, the text) misaligning with the stress pattern of the meter , while in prosodic dissonance, the stress pattern of the text (prosody) is dissonant with the stress pattern of the melody (typically defined by patterns of durational and registral accents)—whether it aligns with the meter or not. Prosodic dissonance may occur between the text and metric accents, but syncopation has the potential to undermine that effect. For example, the verses to Billie Eilish’s “bad guy” (2019) frequently anticipate the meter with the melody ( Example 16 ), with many of the notes shifted off the beat. Despite the shifting, this doesn’t feel particularly dissonant: “like,” a strong syllable, gets a longer duration, as does the stronger syllable in “cont rol .” The line “I told you I’d change ” in Example 13 above also matches syllabic and melodic stress that does not land on the beat. Because the two phenomena involve different types of interactions between musical layers (text/metric accent vs. text/melodic accent), syncopation and prosodic dissonance can interact or operate independently. A moment may be syncopated but prosodically consonant, it may be prosodically dissonant and syncopated, it may be prosodically dissonant without syncopation, or, of course, it may be prosodically consonant and unsyncopated. Examples 17–20 provide hypothetical, simple examples of each. Example 17 . An unsyncopated, prosodically consonant setting (click to enlarge) Example 18 .

Contrast this with Example 18, which takes the accented syllables “-view,” “-vise,” “don’t,” and “pa-” and places them musically in various states of stress. Yet, the accent pattern of the melody does not allow for a syncopated hearing; it is unclear which events would be stressed to allow such an interpretation. Example 19 provides the opposite context, with the stressed syllables of the text evoking a tresillo . (31) Because of this pitch accent and apparent syncopation, “de-” and “-vered” do not sound prosodically dissonant, particularly if we reduce the vowel for the first syllable. Finally, Example 20 uses both prosodic dissonance and syncopation: syncopation in the melodic stream (which, like Example 19, is grouped by contour into 3+3+2), and prosodic dissonance in the resulting emphasis of “de-” and “-ry” as well as a relative shortening of “lunch.”",

In these cases, a prosodically dissonant hearing and a syncopated hearing can be framed as competing modes of listening: If the linguistic features (such as syllabic stress patterns) are prioritized, or seem to overwhelm the musical features, the lyrics can create or reinforce syncopation—in other words, the features of the language are superimposed onto the music. If, in contrast, we mentally prioritize the musical features, this can overwrite the features of the lyrics, causing us to hear prosodic dissonance. Example 21 .

The moment in question is the sung rendition of “art’s in pop culture in me” at the end of the verse. The stressed syllables here as spoken are “art,” “pop,” “cul-,” and “me.” Without any clear syncopation in the melody, and with a repeated step down gesture on each of the four quarter notes, the emphasis ends up on “-ture” instead of “cul-,” causing a moment of dissonance. Parallelism intensifies this further, with the previous phrases ending with “some of us just like to read” and “suddenly the Koons is me,” both of which have a prosodically consonant strong syllable on beat 3. (32) However, drawing our attention to the accompanying tracks rather than the melody alone can lessen the experience of prosodic dissonance and even shift it to a syncopated hearing. The melodic synthesizer present from the very beginning of the song, transcribed in Example 22 , articulates a tresillo pattern behind each phrase, which conflicts with the first two lines of the lyrics but comes to fruition with the similarly tresillo -evocative prosody of “art’s in pop culture in me.” While this article has so far focused exclusively on melody, since the singing itself is a natural place to look for prosodic dissonance, this example demonstrates that other musical layers can also affect the prosody, if less overtly. By shifting our focus to different aspects of the music, we can toggle between two distinct rhythmic listening experiences of this passage—parallelism or the synthesizer, speech or song, syncopation or prosodic dissonance.

The more musical emphasis on a weak syllable—through pitch, duration, metric position, timbre, articulation, or a combination of the above—the more prosodically dissonant a moment will sound. Similarly, the less musical differentiation or accent there is—or the more musical support for a strong syllable there is—the more possible it becomes to hear syncopation. Parallelism, vowel shape, and rhyme, discussed above, can further reinforce one of these hearings. For example, if we removed the octave leap in Example 19 and lengthened the weak syllable, the resulting musical emphasis on “-vered” would tip the balance back toward prosodic dissonance, as shown in Example 23 . Yet if we were to change the setting to be as uniform as possible, as in Example 24 , we would likely still favor a syncopated hearing. In other words, when possible , we prefer a hearing that aligns features of music and lyrics. (33) Since rap frequently uses only minimal melodic features, this preference also accounts for the relative lack of prosodic dissonance—and relative prevalence of lyric syncopation—in rap music as compared to sung music.

If, however, the text has adjacent stressed syllables (sometimes called a spondee in discussions of poetic rhythm) or long strings of weak syllables, it may be much more difficult to conjure a syncopated version of the text. We can speak with adjacent stressed syllables in English, but we cannot perceive two quick adjacent accents in music as easily ( Ohriner 2019b ). In Example 18, the three adjacent accents in “-vise, don’t pa-” render it more difficult to “shift” our sense of accent to hear it as syncopated. In short, features of the music and language can privilege or exclude prosodic dissonance, privilege or exclude syncopation, or contribute to a paradoxical experience where both are simultaneously present.

Compare this sound to Example 26 , an excerpt from Ariana Grande, “positions”(2020). The lyrics to this passage, “I’m just hoping I don’t repeat history,” would typically be spoken as one unit. Ariana Grande’s delivery separates them into two segments, adding space between the two syllables of “repeat” to create a feeling of interruption. Furthermore, her choice to pronounce rather than reduce the vowel in “re-” further reinforces the phrase-ending emphasis on this syllable. (37)",

Which syllables are strongest (most pitch-accented; longest; with the clearest vowels) and weakest (least pitch-accented; shortest; vowel-reduced)? Where do we put pauses or resting points? Is there any parallelism with the prosody of the surrounding lyrics? Determine the prosody for the melody as sung, ideally by singing it aloud. Where are the phenomenal accents (particularly durational and registral)? If the moment in question is not syncopated, where are the strongest metric positions? Where do we hear pauses or resting points? Is there any parallelism with the prosody of the surrounding melody? Does the melody, or one of the other musical layers, lend itself to hearing syncopation that changes any of the above interpretation? Given the first two steps, identify and interpret prosodic dissonance: Identify places where the most stressed spoken syllables match up with the most unstressed sung notes or vice versa. Identify places where the most space between spoken syllables matches up with the least space between sung notes or vice versa (enjambment). These are moments of prosodic dissonance. The stronger the contrast, the stronger the dissonance. Consider how previous material shapes our hearing of prosody. Does any parallelism intensify or lessen the apparent misalignment? If the moment in question does not sound prosodically dissonant, consider: Is there an alternate pronunciation of the text (e.g., contrastive stress, multiple accepted pronunciations), or an alternate hearing of the melody ( e.g., syncopation , different interpretation of the accent structure, parallelism with a previous event ), that can account for the unexpected consonance? Consider how the prosody changes the hearing of the text. Does it create or emphasize aspects of the lyrics (e.g., rhyme)? 5. Analysis and Tension",

From here, we would expect “same,” “shoes,” and “fact” to be emphasized, with a pause where the comma is. Instead, five elements contribute to a prosodically dissonant setting that beautifully summarizes the above. First, Kesha’s rapping intonation places pitch accents on “the” (a weak syllable) and “shoes,” higher than the intervening “same” (a strong syllable). Second, the text itself has two consecutive stressed syllables (“same shoes”), making a mental shift to syncopation impossible. Third, the emphasis on the vowel-reduced syllable “the,” coupled with a slight backing-up and near monophthong-ization of the diphthong in “same”—[seɪm] becomes something closer to [sɛɪm]—adds phonetic emphasis to the dissonance. Fourth, the parallelism from the previous two lines’ consonance makes the text stick out by comparison. Finally, the short duration between “shoes” and “that’s” (where we would expect a pause) creates enjambment dissonance before bringing the listener abruptly out of the prosodic dissonance and back into the following consonance (“that’s a fact ”). Within a few seconds, this third line of text begins with prosodic consonance (“Just found out me and Elton John ”), abruptly shifts to dissonance (“have the same shoes ”), and ends with brief consonance (“that’s a fact ”).

(42) The lyrics and the music both use a short-short-long motivic structure, but whereas the melody uses two short ideas of equal length, the text’s short ideas have different numbers of syllables, with phrases gradually increasing in length. The notion of “short-short-long” therefore effects different rhythmic experiences as we hear conflicting phrase rhythms through the prosody. In this way, Royal & the Serpent outlines a metaphorical arch shape from accent-based prosodic dissonance to enjambment dissonance and back again, affecting the perception of tension in the first two lines. Setting a precedent that will recur throughout the song, the enjambment-dissonant placement of “out” also reinforces the internal rhyme with “loud.” Example 31 .

I interpret this prosodic dissonance as a form of text painting, illustrating the narrator’s discomfort, sense of nonbelonging, and difficulty conforming to expected social norms. This process continues in the next line, which once again begins with consonance (“nobody gets it”) before placing the strongest dissonance on a word describing the narrator (“sensitive”). The placement of “-tive” in the following musical subphrase creates the same enjambment dissonance pattern as the very first couplet, this time breaking a musical phrase in the middle of a word. In the line following “sensitive,” Royal & the Serpent adds more syllables, creating the most syllable-dense line of both her verses together. The setting is relatively consonant, stressing the strong syllables “list-,” “eye-,” and “ex-” as shown in Example 32 ); however, the inserted additional syllable contributes to the information density, further expressing the sentiment of the song.",

Interestingly, this rigidity does not always match the meter; anticipatory syncopation is plentiful throughout this song. At some points, the prosody aligns with this syncopation; in other places, prosodic dissonance arises as an effect of ignoring this syncopation.

While the verses play with strong enjambment and accent dissonances to convey discomfort, the percussion and repetition in the chorus express the narrator’s anxiety through a rigid, inflexible melodic accent structure. Finally, one additional moment of timing-based prosodic dissonance in the chorus further contributes to the text painting: Royal & the Serpent’s delivery of the line “makes it hard to breathe” slightly condenses the expected pacing of these syllables, placing “hard” and “breathe” closer together compared to “makes.” This suggests a rushing through the syllables, directly conveying the breathlessness expressed in the lyrics themselves.

Furthermore, whereas the emphasis in the text “mad about it” would be consonant with stress on “mad” and “-bout” (supported by the pitch accents), the parallelism of the previous lyrics, “going to hell” and “being myself,” gives the conflicting impression of emphasis on the last syllable, “it.” The ending rhyme with “did” intensifies the viability of this hearing.",

(47) My initial impression is that prosodic dissonance is less common in choruses, marking “Unconditionally” as a notable exception and offering a partial explanation as to why it received more negative attention than other prosodically dissonant songs. Further analyses, either at the level of individual pieces or entire corpora, could shine light on the formal associations of this phenomenon.

Analyzing prosodic dissonance in classical genres opens a new, if related, set of questions, since many of the texts predate their musical settings rather than being co-created. Prosodic dissonance can be a marker of musical style or individual artistry, helping to define or cross genre boundaries. The perception of its presence or absence, therefore, will likely be affected by the genre and by the typical listening habits of those asked. Audio Example 3 .

Not only might vowel sounds other than reduction be grounds for prosodic dissonance on their own—e.g. re-pronouncing words in order to rhyme them—I also hypothesize that how speechlike or songlike an artist’s delivery sounds can intensify or weaken the effect of prosodic dissonance. For instance, Audio Example 3 contains an excerpt from Olivia Rodrigo, “brutal,” which evokes a speaking quality. The prosodic dissonance in this example is particularly jarring, owing in large part to her delivery: the combination of her low conversational tone with the apparent shift in emphasis from the musical context suggests the very awkwardness depicted in the lyrics. Similarly, some melodies with more songlike qualities might soften the effect of dissonance—unless the pitch of the melody seems to add to that conflict. The timing of artists’ breaths can also affect the suggestion of phrase breaks, perhaps independently from duration itself ( Beaudoin 2024 ). The growing subfield of timbre studies benefits from the inclusion of interdisciplinary, linguistic notions such as phonetics, dialect studies, and vocal tone. (49) Audio Example 4 .

When a mispronunciation of a word becomes common to a group of speakers rather than one individual, it ceases to be a mispronunciation and becomes a marker of style, dialect, or other meanings. Another area for future research would be to choose music performed by speakers of different dialects (British dialects, American dialects, Australian dialects, Singaporean dialects, AAVE, etc.) and compare their treatment of prosody. It also follows that the perception of prosodic dissonance will depend on the rarity of a given pronunciation—what I call the “somebody effect.” (50) Even if a word’s pronunciation does not change in speech, its expected sung emphasis can migrate, for example, in the common placement of stress on either of the first two syllables of “somebody” (see Audio Examples 4 and 5 ). (51) Further cognitive and linguistic studies would be necessary to understand more fully the extent and conditions of this overexposure effect. Example 35 .

(54) I believe music theory could benefit from this shift at every structural level. When we encounter what we initially interpret as bad text setting, or any other type of “mistake,” particularly in popular music, it would serve us better to approach it with curiosity in addition to or instead of arbitration. While one anomaly could be a sign of misunderstanding what musical traits a genre typically employs, or of importing traits from one style to another, repeated instances of the same anomaly make a pattern that changes what the traits are of the style itself. (55) Rather than—or at least in addition to—laughing at apparent “mispronunciation” or heralding it as a sign of the decline of art (as amateurs and professional theorists have done throughout history), we only stand to gain from setting aside our value judgments and asking why this sounds mispronounced and what that does to our musical experience.",

                "text": "[6.14] So what of “Unconditionally”? We could craft a variety of narratives accounting for Katy Perry’s prosodic dissonance in Audio Example 1 and Example 9. Is it a simple case of bad text setting, a byproduct of music and lyrics composed separately, an unintentional use of prosodic dissonance that can nevertheless support our analytical agendas, a reflection of a larger growing discrepancy between English as sung and spoken, or a deliberate “mispronunciation” to gather media attention or make a comment about the conditional love of pop fans? If it is the clarity of compositional intent that determines the difference between artistic expression and bad text setting, we may be missing the point of analysis altogether. There is not, nor can there be, a single “correct” interpretation, but any of the above could be supported or at least investigated. Whether or not Katy Perry and her songwriting team intended it, I choose both to laugh uncomfortably at her rendition of the title word, then to interpret my own discomfort exactly in line with the intended message of the song: regardless of apparent flaws, embarrassing missteps, or music-theoretical naïveté, the narrator proclaims acceptance and love of the whole listener. (56) The song expects the discomfort of our angry tweets and well-meaning pedagogy and dares us to enjoy it unconditionally—whether we ultimately choose to or not.",
