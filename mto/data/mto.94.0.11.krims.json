    "abstract": "A number of music scholars have adapted the work of literary theorist Harold Bloom for their own use. This article examens Bloom’s relation to post-structuralist critical theory in general, and then considers how music-theoretical adaption may slant that relation. It concludes by asserting that music scholarship tends to emphasize the more traditional aspects of Bloom’s work. This, in turn, may allow music theorists to believe we are engaging the challenges of recent critical theory, when in fact we are reinforcing mainstream music-theoretical ideologies.",

Taruskin accuses Straus of\nmisunderstanding (not to be confused with\nmisreading) Bloom and misapplying the latter’s \nideas. Although one may flinch at the\ntone of Taruskin’s review, his criticisms of\nmiscomprehension are, in my view, correct on many\ncounts, albeit incomplete and profoundly shaped\nby Taruskin’s own ideological goals. Also, it is\ndifficult to sanction Taruskin’s insinuations of\ndisingenuousness.

Like many of his\nliterary-theoretical contemporaries (de Man, J.\nHillis Miller, and Geoffrey Hartman among them),\nBloom takes a great deal from Nietzsche,\nincluding a radically skeptical view of truth and\nlanguage and a (largely concomitant) focus on\nrevisionism. (3) This aspect of Bloom’s work is\ncentral to the famous notion of “misreading” as a\nconstructive artistic force. While the\n“misreading” of the poet is certainly a central\naspect of his thought, the necessary “misreading”\nof the critic , by Bloom’s account, is equally\ncentral, and provides a link to much other post-\nstructuralist work. Two of his formulations of\nthis will suffice: “This influence-relation\ngoverns reading just as it governs writing, and\nreading is therefore a miswriting just as writing\nis misreading” ( Bloom 1975a , 3). Or, more\nelaborately, “Reading . . . is very nearly\nimpossible, for every reader’s relation to every\npoem is governed by a figuration of belatedness”\n( Bloom 1975a , 69). The critic replicates and\nmagnifies the poet’s misreading; this, in turn,\nsuggests an indeterminacy of meaning that others\nof a more ‘centrally’ post-structuralist bent,\nlike De Man 1983 and De Bolla 1988 , find\nattractive in Bloom’s thought.",

( De Bolla 1988 focuses\nprincipally on these aspects of Bloom.) Not only\nthe revisionary ratios, but the entire structure\nof Bloom’s intertexuality depends on the notion\nof the poems as positioned rhetorically toward\ntheir predecessors. By stressing the necessity to\nread poems as tropes on other poems, Bloom\neffectively counters traditional notions such as\nthe organic coherence of texts, creating another\noverlap with some of his contemporaries. In\ngeneral, by centering tropes and rhetoric, Bloom\nindicates a focus not altogether discontinuous\nfrom those of, for instance, de Man, Derrida,\nHartman, and so on. Indeed, de Man’s famous\nreview ( 1983 ) of The Anxiety of Influence ,\nwhile severely reproaching Bloom on some counts,\nattempts to rehabilitate that book by singling\nout its focus on rhetoric (not surprisingly,\nrecommending a shift to the linguistic realm). \n[1.3] Despite the overlaps just discussed, some\naspects of Bloom’s principal theoretical work\nremain radically apart from many post-\nstructuralist practices. In many respects, Bloom’s \nwork restores a rather traditional notion of the \nsubject, and several related concepts, “spirituality”,\n“meaning”, and “originality”: in de Bolla’s\nwords, Bloom promotes a certain “nostalgia for\nthe subject” ( 1988 , 77).

Thus, Bloom’s protection of\ntraditional subjectivity against a (largely\nfictional) “school of Deconstruction” is not\nmerely an attempt at psychological\nfoundationalism: it is also a means of protecting\ntraditional literary-discursive values such as\n“originality” and “spirituality.” Not\nsurprisingly, Bloom’s championing of the subject\nas constituted anterior to (if not outside of)\nlanguage was one of the principal points of\ncontention with de Man (and to a lesser extent,\nDerrida) over the years.

Other, more\nnotoriously conservative aspects of Bloom’s\nwriting—his stubborn reinforcement of the\ntraditional poetic canon, his acerbic dismissals\nof feminism—are far from surprising, given his\nstances on the more abstract, but still (let’s\nnot forget) highly political issues just\ndiscussed.

A\nremarkable aspect of the latter is their close\nresemblance to traditional analyses. In the first\nchapter, Straus announces Bloom’s theory as a\nremedy for “what has become a virtual dogma in\nmusic theory: organic coherence”(16); and yet,\nStraus’ own musical analyses reflect this\n“virtual dogma” through and through. He\nconsistently discusses and analyzes pieces\naccording to principles of their internal\nstructural coherence; the Bloomian aspect, to the\nextent there is one, lies in the commentary that\nStraus then adds to the essentially structuralist\nanalyses.",

(Straus’ own\nclaims are more essentialist than my wording “may\nbe interpreted” indicates, but let us leave that\nissue aside, at least for the moment.) In doing\nso, he employs analytic methods steeped in the\nsame tradition of “organic coherence” for which\nhe, in the first chapter, had cited Bloom as a\npotential remedy: pitch-class-set analysis, a\nmethod designed to maximalize the coherence of an\ninterpretation; and inversional symmetry, an\nanalytical premise that creates a coherence of\npitch-class (or, sometimes, pitch) space. If the\npieces he discusses are relational structures (as\nhe argues in the first chapter), then they are\nrelational structures only by being self-\ncontained structures in the first place—the\nreverse of Bloom’s view.",

The very premises of our\nfield—inventing models of musical structure\nand analyzing pieces as exemplars of structure—dissonate with that which recent critical theory\nhas to teach us.

We saw earlier that Bloom\nregarded misreading as an activity not only of\npoets (in Straus: composers) but also of critics\n(in Straus: music theorists and/or historians).\nIn fact, critics, for Bloom, are even more\nsubject to misreading, since their predecessors\ninclude both poets and other critics. As\nmentioned before, the critic’s misreading creates\nthe gap between reader and text that makes\nreading “very nearly impossible.” And yet, this\ngap, so characteristic of post-structuralist\nviews of reading, does not exist in Straus’\nversion of Bloom. The analyses are glimpsed and\ndiscussed as if in ‘full view’; the analytic\nstatements that are made are not presented as\nproblematic—Straus is not a misreader of the\npieces he discusses. Again, the ideological\ngrounds of music theory and critical theory are\nin conflict. As music theorists, we are still\naccustomed to attributing a certain ontological\nstatus to our analyses and theories—this IS\nthe structure of atonal music, this IS a five-\npiece, and so on. This status is incompatible\nwith the critic as misreader—we must, as music\ntheorists, be capable of divining the essences of\nmusic in a more traditional subject/object\nrelationship. Bloom’s stance, though, despite the\nmany traditional aspects of his work, comes more\nby way of Nietzsche, positing the reader as a\nrevisionist fully as much as the composer. This\nmore typically post-structuralist aspect of Bloom\ndisappears, almost by necessity, in its\nconfrontation with music theoretical work.",

In that sense, the more traditional\nmethodologies of music theory win out. But what\nabout the more conservative, traditional aspects\nof Bloom’s work? Specifically, what about the\nrestoration of the subject, originality, and the\ncomposer as the site of meaning? Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, these survive very well not only in\nStraus’ work, but more generally in the work of\nother music scholars who, in one way or another,\nhave adapted Bloom for their own purposes, such\nas Korsyn 1991 and Yudkin 1992 . In each of\nthese, a canonically ‘great’ composer’s struggle\nagainst the past becomes the site of meaning for\nthe piece(s) in question; the originality (and,\nsimilarly, the ‘strength’) of the composer(s) is\ncommended because of his successfully negotiating\nthe various (and varying) revisionary ratios; and\ndocuments from the composer’s life are marshalled\nto back up the claims and concretize the posited\nsubjectivity. In other words, values from\ntraditional music theory and musicology are\nreinforced by the versions of Bloom being used\nhere, not challenged. In this sense, Taruskin’s\npolemics get out of hand when he claims that\n“Bloom is simply irrelevant to Straus’ methods\nand purposes” (126); Straus’ version of Bloom,\nalthough certainly a selective one (as he himself\nseems to acknowledge in Straus 1994 ), is by no\nmeans entirely removed from the ideological\nstrains of the original theory.
