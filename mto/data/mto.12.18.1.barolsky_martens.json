    "abstract": "While Bach’s Prelude in C minor from theWell-Tempered ClavierBook 1 (BWV 847) is straightforward in several respects, its duple hypermeter defies simple and consistent continuation. In what is often regarded as an idiosyncratic interpretation of the piece, Glenn Gould grapples with this complex hypermeter and offers a carefully considered and compelling analysis. Through a comparison with performances by Samuel Feinberg, Wanda Landowska, and with Carl Czerny's performance edition, we argue that Gould reveals new tensions and structures within Bach’s score.",

These performances have come to represent the extremes of Gould’s interpretative development; see Martens 2007 for an analysis of Gould’s explicit manipulations of beat level in 1981 relative to 1955.",

This juxtaposition—the sight of the piano’s inner workings with the sound of Gould’s disembodied and detached, almost mechanistic interpretation—evokes an analytical perspective, an “X-ray” of the performance that reveals Gould’s calculated dissection of Bach’s Prelude.",

But they might be onto something. A closer look at Gould’s idiosyncratic performance both clarifies and obscures what traditional analytical techniques tell us about the C-minor Prelude. Gould’s unique articulation and voicing clarify the musical texture in a manner that illuminates less tractable issues in counterpoint, hypermeter, and harmonic tension. Yet, by comparing and contrasting Gould’s performative “X-ray” of the Prelude with that of other performers and editors, we will demonstrate how the pianist ultimately opens up new unresolved questions, while still generating what is, for many, an artistically compelling interpretation of this work.

(5) Consider the opening four measures: like its C-major predecessor, the C-minor Prelude uses a standard progression to establish the tonic (here, i– iv –vii o7 –i). But as opposed to David Ledbetter’s claim that Bach intended this Prelude to help bring the “thumb and little finger into line with the middle three fingers” so that “all five fingers are equal,” Gould distinguishes the notes on the first and third beats with a sharp accent ( Ledbetter 2002 , 136 and 151; listen to Gould’s performance in Example 1).

This slight deviation from convention has two effects. First, it distinguishes Gould’s melody from its motoric accompaniment. Second, Gould demonstrates in his performance what many scholars have indicated in their analyses, namely that this figure, which is also brought out by Gould in the Prelude’s final measure (C5–B4–C5), anticipates the “mordent of the fugue subject” that follows ( Keller 1976 , 52). We will return to the potential significance of this figure for Gould below.",

The path between these relative keys, however, allows for and even encourages a fascinating array of interpretive solutions from an equally varied group of performers. We will continue with Gould’s performance in order to frame the issues in these measures ( Example \n3a ). In keeping with the style he introduced in the first four measures, Gould continues to articulate the first and third beats of each bar. But the expression of these notes varies in accordance with the inherent contrapuntal tension, thereby creating a two-bar hypermeter. Gould’s E ♭ 5s, for instance, resonate much longer than their sixteenth-note duration would suggest. As the E ♭ 5 falls to D5 in measure 6, however, the pianist changes his melodic articulation to sharp, short staccati. Gould repeats this strong-weak pattern again in measures 7–8. Example 3.

Samuel Feinberg, for instance, plays measures 5 and 7 loudly and with great gusto, retreating dramatically and dynamically in measures 6 and 8. ( Example \n3b ) Other pianists such as Edwin Fischer, Sviatoslav Richter, Angela Hewitt, and András Schiff also create a subtle dynamic contrast that initiates a two-bar pattern starting in measure 5. Mostly strikingly Wanda Landowska, on her metal-framed Pleyel harpsichord, introduces a change of registration in measures 6 and 8 to distinguish them from the preceding measures. ( Example \n3c ) Although each keyboardist leaves his or her own idiomatic mark on the Prelude, all of their interpretations respond to the harmonic and contrapuntal tension of the secondary dominants in measures 6 and 8 and the relative calm in the surrounding measures (5, 7, and 9).

As we have just seen, his grouping of measure 5–8 resembles that of other musicians even if the manner in which he achieves that grouping stands apart. Additionally, many of his mannerisms correspond to the articulations given in an edition by Carl Czerny (first published by Peters in 1837) that he may have used or consulted ( Example \n4 ). (6) In measures 1–2, for instance, Czerny’s accent on the first and third beats of each measure could very well have led to Gould’s introductory articulation. Similarly, the sforzandi at the beginning of measures 5 and 7 that diminish to piano in measures 6 and 8 suggest the hypermeter that Gould performs. The most significant link between Gould and the Czerny edition is the C in the left hand on the third beat of measure 18, an incorrect note (see Example \n5 ) that the Czerny edition perpetuated (as did the 1866 Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe), and which Gould played. We would surmise that given his overall shaping of the Prelude (discussed more below), and his predilection for countrapuntal lines, Gould would have otherwise embraced the stepwise descent that a B ♭ creates in measures 18–19 on the way to the dominant pedal in measure 21.

The diminished 5th from an unstable dominant harmony is prominent in between the outer voices of measure 13, while its resolution to a consonant 3rd, part of the newly established E ♭ tonic, falls in measure 14 (See Figure 1a ).

Once again, this dynamic contrast appears to resemble the editorial instructions in the Czerny edition. In measure 10, however, Gould makes a curious decision and returns to the ringing articulation first introduced in measure 5; the soprano B ♭ 4 resonates over the entire measure. At first listen, one might understand measures 9–10 as a reversal of the hypermeter’s polarity, from the weaker (shorter) beat on the first measure of the pair, the stronger (longer) beat on the second. (8) Indeed, these two bars could represent a transition in which the harmonic and contrapuntal pattern of the previous two measures is maintained while the metric emphasis switches in anticipation of the end of the phrase. But after measure 10, Gould continues to let the soprano note reverberate, ultimately suspending the hypermeter and eliminating the previously existing pattern as a plausible percept. Figure 1b .

The harmonic sequence and chain of suspensions continue through measure 11. Having reached his eventual tonal goal, Bach breaks the sequence in measure 12 and establishes E ♭ major with a conventional cadential progression ( IV – V –I). It is the introduction of the predominant here that forces a shift of some type. Although dominant-tonic pairs lay across “2–1” segments of the hypermeter during the sequence, it is not difficult to accept a reversal of the established harmonic/hypermetric linkage and instead privilege hypermetric continuation (see Figure 1b , first three columns).",

Using dynamic contrast across the full bar rather than emphasis on individual notes, Feinberg establishes the two-bar hypermeter in measure 5 which he continues through measure 10 (see Figure 1b). In measure 11, Feinberg maintains the softer dynamic level of the previous measure, initiating a four-bar cadential phrase that resolves to E ♭ (I 6 – IV – V –I). While he sets this cadential progression apart with a consistently soft dynamic level, he does nothing to disrupt the vestiges of the established hypermeter. Doing so he creates a phrase in measures 11–14 that mimics his own shaping of measures 1–4. In similar fashion, Czerny’s measure 9 moves away from the explicitly stressed pattern of the preceding measures, but his dynamic markings allow the established two-bar pairing to continue: forte in measures 9–10, diminuendo through measures 11–12, and piano in measures 13–14 (Figure 1b and Example \n3).",

As the analysis in Figure 1 shows, Gould divides measures 5–14 into two groups of five bars that suggest rhetorically an antecedent-consequent phrase pair. As noted above, Gould’s oscillating articulations in measures 5–9 reinforce Bach’s harmonic sequence in its movement away from a stable key area. His gradual shortening of the soprano notes in measures 10–13 convey instead the sense of a single expansive teleological gesture leading into the more stable E ♭ major in measure 14.",

Like Feinberg, Landowska extends the two-bar hypermeter through measure 9. But like Gould, the harpsichordist marks measure 10 as the starting point for her own large-scale push towards the cadence in measure 14; this is her moment to disrupt the hypermeter, and it is more jarring than Gould’s disruption. (9) Her instrument growls to a new level of intensity as the left-hand drops in register to more closely spaced and more dissonant patterns in measure 10, though she too uses consistently sustained soprano notes to weld these five bars together. Both Gould and Landowska in essence elide the sequence with the cadential progression, beginning a goal-oriented trajectory with the initial (and intra-sequential) occurrence of E ♭ ’s dominant harmony, the B ♭ in measure 10. A division at measure 10 brings a compelling balance to measures 5–14, the material between a typical key-establishing phrase (measures 1–4) and the tonic of the relative major (measure 14), while it creates interest by cutting across the audible boundary between sequence and cadential progression.",

Where Feinberg and Czerny follow the hypermetric structure and separate the cadence from the sequence in measure 11, Gould and Landowska disrupt the sequence, insisting on the inclusion of measure 10 as the moment that initiates the cadential drive. Indeed, it may be their intention to emphasize this cadence through the disruption of the hypermeter that also accounts for why they maintain intensity through measure 14, the opposite of Czerny and Feinberg, who pull away. Although all four musicians are unanimous in communicating a sense of arrival in m 14, each performer chooses a different path. Since each version uses a different moment of transition from sequence to cadence, to say nothing of their different means (dynamics, articulation, registration) and/or media (harpsichord, piano, score markings), comparing them is to compare apples and oranges (and pears and...). Nevertheless, Figure 1 attempts to demonstrate the diverse ways in which these musicians portray the organization and direction of Bach’s music.",

In addition to the harmonic logic behind this shift of articulation, there is also a kinesthetic rationale behind it as well. This measure is the first time in the entire Prelude where the note on the second and fourth beats ( E ♭ ) sits above the offbeat mordent figures. One should be wary of suggesting that Bach changed his pattern specifically to emphasize this moment of arrival, since it was perhaps the closeness of both hands that forced Bach to write the E ♭ in the elevated range. It is at the very least a happy coincidence that this change occurs at this cadential arrival and it should come as no surprise that all three musicians choose to subdivide the measure.",

But he maintains this lower voice for a single measure before joining most other pianists and driving forward with a renewed feel of 2/2 in measure 16.

As a way to add interest to what might be taken for a finger exercise, the pianist gives voice to an impish gesture from within the left hand.",

As mentioned above, Gould creates a transition from measures 14–15, using the suddenly subdivided half-note beat to elide the cadence in E-flat major with the harmonic departure that follows. The registral equality of all four beats that was noted in the right hand of measure 14 is replicated in the left hand of measure 15; the on-beat left hand pitches have never before been only a step apart. Gould makes the most of this link, using it to shift the emphasis from the soprano to the bass voice. With the ear now caught and directed to the lower range, it is easy for the listener to follow the subsequent descent of the bass line to G in measure 21, a descent that is emphasized by Gould.",

The analytical Gould is taking pains to show that this bass descent is simply a continuation of an overall stepwise descent beginning with the E ♭ 5 of measure 5, the highest pitch in the first half of the Prelude as well as Schenker’s Kopfton . One can easily trace this descent in the upper voice to soprano G4 in measure 14, after which Schenker sees the line descending just two more steps to E ♭ 4 in measure 18, completing a register transfer of the initial E ♭ 5 ( Schenker 1926 , 48). Gould, focusing on line in general and not on voice-leading strata, takes measure 15 as the crux in a soprano-to-bass transition of the line; F4 arrives in the soprano and, with his peculiar dynamic encouragement, is itself transferred down an octave and heard as giving way to E ♭ 3 in the bass.",

As Kevin Bazzana has argued, Gould’s interpretations were influenced by the idea of the developing variation of Brahms and Schoenberg ( 1997 , 20–35). The pianist was known on more than one occasion to project innocuous or accompanimental lines, or to even change the notes in the score, in order to emphasize (or create) unifying motivic links ( Bazzana 1997 , 91–94). Indeed, as the Prelude continues after the texture change in measure 25, Gould alters the tempo regularly in order to frame this three-note figure. (10) In the last measure, Gould allows the final C to continue ringing even as the concluding gesture continues, demarcating the end of the three-note figure (C5–B4–C5) heard at the top of the phrase.",

In other words, is Gould X-raying the music in order to reveal its inner workings, or is he foisting his own whimsical and anachronistic aesthetic values onto the Prelude? The answer, it would seem, is both. More important, the observations in this article ultimately blur and undermine the distinction between these polar perspectives. Not only is Gould’s performance no less anachronistic than the analytical views of Schenker and other 20th-century theorists (even as they presume to speak for the composer’s intentions), but, as we have seen, the idiosyncrasies of his interpretation both reinforce and coincide with those qualities about which most analysts and performers appear to concur, e.g., the hypermeter in measures 5–8. In comparison with other editions and renditions, Gould’s performance draws our attention to complexities, tensions, and structures within Bach’s score that reveal the degree to which Bach’s Prelude is anything but prosaic.",
