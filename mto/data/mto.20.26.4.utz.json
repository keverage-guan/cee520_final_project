    "abstract": "Arnold Schoenberg’sSechs kleine Klavierstücke(Six Little Piano Pieces), op. 19 (1911), offer a fruitful case study to examine and categorize performers’ strategies in regard to their form-shaping characteristics. A thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of 46 recordings from 41 pianists (recorded between 1925 to 2018), including six recordings from Eduard Steuermann, the leading pianist of the Second Viennese School, scrutinizes the interdependency between macro- and microformal pianistic approaches to this cycle. In thus tracing varying conceptions of a performance-shaped cyclic form and their historical contexts, the continuous unfurling of the potential of Schoenberg’s musical ideas in both “structuralist” and “rhetorical” performance styles is systematically explored, offering a fresh approach to the controversial discussion on how analysis and performance might relate to one another.",

A preliminary German version of the present essay was translated by Maxwell Phillips, to whom we express our sincere thanks, and further edited by the authors and the translator for publication. The research documented in this article was conducted as part of the research project Performing, Experiencing and Theorizing Augmented Listening (PETAL), supported by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (P 30058-G26, 1/9/2017–31/8/2020). Laurence Willis (a contributor to the project until December 31, 2018) played a crucial part in the genesis and formation of the annotated score described below, for which we thank him warmly. Majid Motavasseli (a contributor to the project since January 1, 2019) provided valuable assistance in the detailed listening analysis of Steuermann’s three studio recordings of op. 19.

This surprising result is due to the fact that Kraus accelerates dramatically in the passages excluded in the calculation of the main tempo (mm. 2.2–2.6, 11.2–12, and 14–17, see footnotes 24 and 38 ), especially in mm. 14–17 (see Example 8), so that a shorter duration results than would be expected based on the choice of main tempo.",

The values given here are based on deviations only in those passages considered for the measurement of the main tempo—i.e., in the measures where no tempo modifications are given in the score (see footnote 24 ). It can nonetheless also be instructive to consider the relative standard deviation from the main tempo for all tempo values from the first piece. The two relative standard deviation values (with and without consideration of the “variance measures”) show significant differences. For instance, in Harris 1951, a recording that stands out in many ways, the value excluding the variance measures is relatively inconspicuous at 30.2/27.4, while including these measures gives at 47.0/34.2 the second highest value of all the recordings and thus better reflects the impression of an extreme fluctuation in the tempo.",

In any case, the moment of thematic contrast, fundamental to Schoenberg’s own understanding of sonata form (see, among others, Schoenbergʼs “Entwurf einer Vortragsreihe” (T50.19), undated, in Jacob 2005 , 2:675), is more clearly pronounced in m. 7 than in mm. 4.5–6.3 (which alternatively might be understood as a “secondary theme”). This earlier phrase, in its chromatically falling line (see the melodic-harmonic analysis in the annotated score) and its polyphonic structure, has a more typically transitional character, while the thematic contrast of figure in m. 7 is marked compositionally by a change in the texture and motivic content (the double-dotted rhythm).

Swinkin’s view seems convincing at first, but in the end resigns itself to the impossibility of a concrete relationship between theory/analysis and performance.

This question, which Nicholas Cook had posed already in 1999 , (1) remains difficult to answer today, despite a blossoming of new directions in musical performance studies in the last two decades. The intention of avoiding prescriptive analysis, which claims to derive a recipe for “correct” performance from the structure of the music, has led researchers to consider the value of moving from performance to analysis. Our research takes up this trend, and we especially attempt to further develop the idea that musical form is not grounded in the score alone, but—following the harpsichordist Robert Hill—is also brought forth by the performers “in real-time” ( Hill and Mahnkopf 2015 , 19).

(2) An important tendency of this scholarship is the attempt to break with the text-centered approach of traditional music theory and musicology, in the sense of the performative turn . The goal is not simply to compare or even adjudicate between performances seen merely as different “interpretations” of a fixed text, but rather to emphasize the autonomy of the performance with respect to its model. For Cook this shift leads to the concept of the “work as performance”: the attempt to conceive of the work on the basis of the situatedness of performative agency (and not of a fixed text) ( Cook 2013 , 237–48; Utz 2015 , 279).

At the same time, we aim to point to the complex interaction of interpretative decisions with historical discourses and tropes of the music’s reception. Our research thus attempts to demonstrate that in addition to being historical documents in their own right, practical, sounding interpretations can exhibit fully valid analyses of a work ( Cook 1995 ; Lester 1995 ). This sounding evidence can be treated on a par with music-theoretical analyses or written historical documents with mutually fruitful results. We ultimately consider a musical text and its sounding performance(s) as central representations of a musical work. (3) By positing a continuous interaction between performance and analysis, this article aims at investigating performance strategies towards cyclic (macro-)form. While we have taken efforts not to prejudice recorded performances by analytical insights gained beforehand, we acknowledge that performances occur in a discursive space in which (implicit or explicit) analytical thought is continuously present—for example, by aspects of “informed intuition” ( Rink 2002 , 36) on which performers build their sounding interpretations.",

(5) For Leech-Wilkinson, for example, “long-term structures are theoretical, useful for composers, an invitation from analysts to imagine music in a particular way, but apparently not perceptible (save in the vaguest outline via memory)” ( 2012 , [4.10]). On the other hand, Doğantan-Dack observed as early as 2008 that “the way a performer handles local details is very much related to her conception of large-scale relationships—or her lack thereof” ( 2008 , 305). We therefore proceed on the assumption that the relationship of micro- and macroform between the poles of performance and analysis holds many as yet unanswered questions that shall be scrutinized in the following discussion. 2.

Several early recordings are available from pianists close to the Schoenberg school, for which a close link between structural analysis and pianistic interpretation can be assumed. Particularly noteworthy are the six recordings by Eduard Steuermann, which Christian Utz ( forthcoming ) has considered in detail in their historical context in a separate article. Also, the short duration of these pieces allows a detailed evaluation of a relatively large number of different recordings. The following investigation is based on both quantitative and qualitative analyses of 46 recordings from 41 pianists, including the six by Steuermann (1949, 1954, 1957a, 1957b, 1962, 1963) and 40 other recordings stretching from 1925 to 2018, each by a different pianist ( Example 1 ). With the exception of three live recordings by Steuermann and three recordings made for the PETAL project, only published recordings were considered. Selections were based on the criteria of historical balance (we considered approximately the same percentage of recordings for each decade, from the 1920s to the present), international relevance and prominence of the performer, and availability of the recordings.

                "text": "[2.3] Schoenberg wrote five of the six pieces of the Klavierstücke , op. 19, in a single day (19 February 1911). The sixth, however, came almost four months later on June 17, likely in response to Gustav Mahler’s funeral on May 22, also the subject of one of Schoenberg’s paintings from the same time period ( Stuckenschmidt 1977 , 108, 137–38; Massow 1993 ; McKee 2005 ). A fair copy in Schoenberg’s hand and the first printed edition of the six pieces contain only minor revisions. The short cycle (with a total duration of around five minutes) is one of Schoenberg’s few contributions to the genre of (usually cyclically ordered) short pieces adopted far beyond the Second Viennese School between 1909 and 1914, a reaction to the so-called “ Mammutismus ,” that was popular in the decades around 1900 (and to which Schoenberg’s Gurre-Lieder —also completed in 1911—were a substantial contribution) ( Obert 2008 , 79–83; Taruskin 2010 , 1–58). Along with the Five Orchestral Pieces , op. 16 (1909), these six piano pieces document in a particularly concentrated form an aesthetic of “phraselessness” [ Phrasenlosigkeit ], of the “exclusion of everything secondary and derived” [ Ausscheidung von Sekundärem, Abgeleitetem ], of “concentration on the essential” [ Konzentration auf Wesentliches ], and of the “suppression of techniques of mediation (for example repetitions)” [ Ausschaltung von Vermittlungen (wie etwa Wiederholungen) ] ( Obert 2008 , 150). (9) This aesthetic had developed in the Second Viennese School since 1906 in connection with, among other things, Karl Kraus’s language criticism.",

                "text": "[2.4] Regarding the creative process, the first question that presents itself is whether Schoenberg could have already viewed the first five pieces as a cyclical unit. A few observations can be of use here. The underlying eighth note pulse of nos. 1 and 5 can be seen as a common “frame,” while the pieces lying between them follow a quarter note pulse. No. 1, the longest piece and the most motivically and thematically complex, suggests relatively clearly the contours of a sonata form. (10) It can thus be seen as a typical “first movement,” carrying a certain weight in the cycle. (11) The last chord of no. 5 is in turn characterized by a decided finality: it is preceded by a penultimate chord with a leading, anacrustic effect and prepared by a prolonged and dynamically prominent cadence (mm. 12–15). [2.5] The addition of the temporally expansive sixth movement (“sehr langsam”), however, establishes a framing effect with the first piece. This renders movements 2–5 as intermediate movements. The sixth piece can thus be understood, on the one hand, as part of a formal frame, particularly if seen as sketching the (admittedly extremely compressed) contours of a sonata form once again. On the other hand, it can be understood (already in the context of its production) as “extraterritorial.” A close relationship to Gustav Mahler’s Ninth Symphony—absent in the first five movements—speaks for this second understanding. (12) And in fact the decision to end op. 19 with a slow movement is itself a reference to the gradually fading Adagio that closes the symphony. [2.6] The four inner movements can be grouped in consecutive pairs, whereby each pair is characterized by gradations of a single tempo category: nos. 2 and 3, “Langsam”—“Sehr langsame quarter note”; and nos. 4 and 5, “Rasch, aber leicht”—“Etwas rasch.” This succession of slow and fast (dance-like) “movements” is reminiscent of the succession of adagio and scherzo movements in sonata and symphonic forms. [2.7] Cyclic cohesion is also constituted by means of pitch relationships between the individual pieces. The final chords of nos. 1, 2, and 5 are each related by half step to their “neighbor chords” at the beginnings of nos. 2, 3, and 6 respectively (see the annotated score). In this way, a rupture is staged around the fourth piece, the only piece not connected by such chords to its neighbors. (13) The strongly contrasting characters of the third and fourth pieces reinforce this rupture. Further cross-movement structural coherences have been extensively discussed in the critical literature since the 1920s. (14) This type of structural analysis aiming for coherence has found particularly rewarding models in the works of the Second Viennese School. Nonetheless, the spontaneous character of the work’s composition and an aesthetic of the subconscious strongly suggest an individualization and emancipation of the detail from its cyclical context. (15) A tendency towards Roland Barthes’s “cycle of fragments” ( 1986a , 1986b , and 1986c ; see also Sprau 2017 ), towards the bursting of formal unity, stands in tension with conventional techniques of cyclical integration. B. Schoenberg’s op. 19 in the Context of the Performance Practice of the Schoenberg School [2.8] To contextualize our discussion of the relation of detail to totality in the individual recordings, we begin by briefly recapitulating the relationship between analysis and performance as understood by the Schoenberg School. It would be too simplistic to describe this tradition as straightforwardly text-centered or analytical, reducing it to a “telepathic fantasy,” an idealized direct communication between composer and listener that views the process of performance as largely dispensable and thus deliberately disregards the social dimension of music making. (16) Adorno, on the contrary, describes a clear difference between analysis and performance: True reproduction is not simply a realization of the results of analysis (incidentally, these results should not be thought of as conclusive). It rather contains the idiomatic element sublated within itself. And it thus necessarily encompasses the performer’s subjectivity, which presents the idiomatic element in relation to every work [. . .]. So it is neither irrational (idiomatic) nor a chemically pure, analytical reproduction, but rather the reinstatement of the mimetic element achieved by passing through the analytical. (17) ( 2006 , 69) Analysis is thus the prerequisite but not the sole reference point for any single performance. For the Schoenberg School, it serves to establish a framework for the following principles (among others): (1) freedom and simultaneously fidelity with respect to the preserved “authority” of the score; (2) a fundamental orientation toward vocality [ Gesangliches ], toward cantabile, in instrumental as well as vocal music; and (3) clarity of performance, achieved through a differentiated agogics, the prohibition of a “scanning” of accents, and the emancipation of the parameter of tempo. (18) Generally speaking, in question is an interlocking of the work-text with its realization by a performer through knowledge of aspects of performance that are not or cannot be notated. [2.9] Particularly striking in relation to the Schoenberg circle’s performance aesthetic of the op. 19 piano pieces is Schoenberg’s instruction, complete with an exclamation mark, at the beginning of the score: “After each piece an extended pause, the pieces must not blend into each other!” (19) This direction is absent from the first autograph and fair copy and could therefore have been a reaction to the first private and public performances (20) —performances that Schoenberg found not entirely satisfying. In a diary entry dated January 22, 1912, Schoenberg complained in this vein about a private performance by Busoni’s pupil Egon Petri (1881–1962): “In general he took everything too fast; or rather too hastily. I said to Webern: One must have time in my music. It is not for people who have other things to do. At any rate it is a great pleasure to hear one’s pieces played by someone who can master them perfectly from a technical point of view” ( Stuckenschmidt 1977 , 156). (21) And again Schoenberg seemed dissatisfied with the first public performance by Louis Closson (1886–?), another Busoni pupil: the tempi were too fast, and Closson failed to pause between the pieces (157).",

The pianist therefore should avoid, against the standard practice at this time for cyclical works, taking the pieces in a single flow through breakless transitions. (22) As with Barthes’s reading of Schumann’s cyclical piano works and Schubert’s Winterreise , D. 911, an interpretation that understands cyclicality not only through coherence, but also through a drifting apart, or a tendency towards fragmentariness of the individual movements, can thus also be justified in the case of Schoenberg’s op. 19. However, it is beyond question that the six pieces, due to their brevity, together form an overarching formal constellation, whose short, ca. five-minute duration allows a graspable whole to emerge—a whole whose (six-limbed) anatomy is reinvented by each new performer.

All of these are marked by relatively compressed total durations (the average total duration of the six Steuermann recordings is 4:39, compared to 5:14 across 40 recordings by other pianists; see Example 2 ). The same applies for Karl Steiner (1912–2001), another pianist closely connected to the Schoenberg school, whose recording is the shortest of the sample of measured recordings (1962, total duration 3:58), and for Else C. Kraus (1890–1979), who had premiered Schoenberg’s Piano Pieces, op. 33a and op. 33b, and recorded op. 19 (for the second time) in 1960 (total duration 4:07). Whether this reflects a specific practice of the Schoenberg school (which Schoenberg’s objection to Petri and Closson’s “hurried” tempi seems to contradict) or rather a general tendency of earlier recordings (up to the 1960s) towards faster tempi—as otherwise well documented (see Philip 1992 , 35–36)—need not be decided here.",

(23) Steuermann’s advice aims for a “large arc,” at least within each of the six pieces, and formulates specific instructions for the performance of many details. Characteristic of Steuermann’s remarks is an oscillation between the requirements of a “unity of tempo” (also supported by metronome markings for each piece—even if their bindingness is relativized) and a “unity of movement” that would follow the individual phrases. The contradictoriness of the categories “main tempo” and “unity of tempo,” to which the Schoenberg school felt entirely obligated ( Haack 2002 ), also comes sharply into focus in Adorno’s ( 2006 , 102) sketches for a theory of musical reproduction.",

As Example 2 also shows, however, Steuermann’s deviations from the mean tempi of the compared 40 recordings are anything but flagrant, with the exception of the third piece (the average across all six Steuermann recordings in this piece lies at 49.5 beats per minute (bpm), markedly above the average across the 40 compared recordings at 37.5 bpm) and the fifth piece, where his average tempo of 111.1 bpm is significantly below the average of the other interpreters at 142.4 bpm (as well as below the tempo suggested in the letter to Gielen, 144 bpm). (24) A specific cyclical dramaturgy can thus be surmised, (25) wherein the fast shaping of no. 3 and slow shaping of no. 5 particularly distinguish Steuermann’s interpretation. In the following discussion, we will consider especially the last of Steuermann’s six recordings, the studio recording from 1963. This is justified by the fact that one can see this last recording as a sort of “legacy,” which in many respects, speaks with the greatest sovereignty. At the same time, this recording’s deviations from his mean values are especially low: the six durations deviate merely between zero and three seconds from the mean values, and deviations from the average main tempi are also especially low (Example 2). This is also the reason for reducing the six Steuermann recordings to the one from 1963 in the calculation of mean duration and tempi most often used as comparative values in the following discussions. Tables and figures variably show mean values of all 46 recordings (including all six recordings from Steuermann), 41 recordings (including only Steuermann 1963), or 40 recordings (excluding all Steuermann recordings, mainly used to highlight the particularities of his interpretation in section 4 ).",

This is followed by a qualitative description of individual recordings (“close listening”) for each of the six pieces (section 4), with special emphasis put on the interaction of detail and whole in the creation of “performed form.” Steuermann’s recording from 1963 serves here to lead and orient the discussion. In conclusion, Steuermann’s position in the performance history of op. 19 will be considered, and the complexity of connections and divergences in this performance history in the context of a performative analysis of the cycle will be demonstrated (section 5).",

Nevertheless, these cannot provide comprehensive insights into the recorded performance history of a musical work. Methodologically, our research does not only rely on the collection and analysis of numerical data, but also includes a close listening and aesthetic description of sounding phenomena. We do not claim that tempo choices are exclusively vehicles of musical structure; they may also be (and have often been described as) means of musical expression in combination with the shaping of dynamics. (27) As the analyses below demonstrate, it is not always clearly discernable whether a performative choice is made out of structural and/or expressive considerations. Moreover, there is the additional problem of assuming that an “expression” calls for a hermeneutic interpretation (e.g., What kind of expression? What is being expressed?), as formal or structural implications of a performance to some extent can be considered “expressive” in their own right. (28) Although we repeatedly point at such implications, we generally refrain from speculative and arbitrary hermeneutic interpretations, leaving our analyses open to some extent. We also seek to avoid applying preconceived models of musicological interpretation and performance studies such as “espressivo,” “neo-objective,” or “historically informed” (see Stenzl 1995 and section 5 below) to any single recorded performance. Despite this skepticism towards the possibility of ascertaining a work’s expressive “content,” our analyses aim at providing criteria for discussing recorded performances with regard to their aesthetic (and historical) value and relevance. 3. Macroformal Models in Recordings of Schoenberg’s op. 19 Example 3 . Total durations of the 46 analyzed recordings in a chronological scatter plot (click to enlarge) Example 4 . Op. 19, 46 recordings from 1925–2018; durations and percent values (click to enlarge) [3.1] A chronological representation in scatter plot form of the total durations of all 46 considered recordings allows the derivation of general trends in the performance history of op. 19, such as a general decrease in tempi and increase in duration, to be interrelated with the individual interpretations of each pianist ( Example 3 ). In this way it becomes evident that the very fast tempi of the earliest recordings by Walter Gieseking (1925) and Jesús María Sanromá (1937) endure well into the 1970s, most notably in the already mentioned recordings by Steuermann (1957a), Kraus (1960) and Steiner (1962), but also Pál Kadosa (1958) and Otto Zykan (1970). On the other hand, Mitsuko Uchida (2000) and Christoph Eschenbach (2000) are especially extreme examples of a tendency towards longer total durations as a particular characteristic of the 2000s: in both interpretations the duration of each individual movement of the performance is (mostly markedly) above the average across the 41 recordings, with Eschenbach’s second and Uchida’s sixth movement as maxima ( Example 4 ). The significant difference between the total durations of these two recordings and all the others (7:22 for Uchida and 6:42 for Eschenbach, exceeding the third longest recording, Chen 1996 at 6:08, by 1:14 and 0:34 respectively) lends them an extraterritorial and indeed, at times, eccentric character.",

Example 4 shows the absolute duration of every movement in each of the 46 recordings (left), as well as the percentage of the recording’s total duration constituted by each movement (right; referred to in the following as “percent value”). Red shading indicates the position of each value in a gradated scale of all recorded values in each column (dark red = highest value, white = lowest value). The variation in percent value among the 41 recordings (given as a relative standard deviation) is significantly less for nos. 1, 2, 3 and 6 (between 11.6% and 14.7%) than for no. 4 (18.7%) and no. 5 (21.2%). To put it another way, the relationship between the durations of the two “scherzo” movements and the four other movements seems to be an important factor in discerning clear differences between the recordings. The absolute duration, on the other hand, varies most noticeably in nos. 2, 5, and 6 (20.9%–25.5%), while no. 1, here as in the case of the percent value, shows the least variation (13.3%, 11.6% for the percent value). In view of the opening movement’s protean form, the lack of exact tempo markings, and the extreme fluctuation of the written-out rubati, this result is nothing short of astonishing. It may suggest that extreme tempi are rarely selected for this opening movement, and that the gestural-thematic character of its formal structure to some degree motivates a tempo-dramaturgical consensus (which does not exclude extreme tempo strategies in this piece, as will be seen below).

It would be imaginable, for example, to attribute a particular perceptual weight to a piece taken unusually fast and pointedly, suggesting that a condensing of the musical flow takes on a substantial (memory) function for the macroformal orientation of the listener as an “imprint” (see Deliège 2001 on the relevance of imprints for the perception of macroform). This aspect is particularly relevant for the contrast model (see [3.11]). Example 7 . Op. 19, frame model; tempo curves for Schleiermacher 1994 and Helffer 1969 (click to enlarge)",

Where nos. 1 and 6 make up approximately the same percentage of the total duration, the frame model is present. The more emphatically these framing movements distinguish themselves from the inner movements, the more clearly the frame model emerges. It is certainly not by chance that the total durations of several recordings approaching this model are significantly higher than the mean value 5:13 (Schleiermacher 1994: 6:00; Bucquet 1973: 5:56; Hill 1996: 5:31; also compare Wolpe 1991: 6:01). Schleiermacher carries the symmetrical principle of the frame model to an extreme ( Example 7 ): the outer frame pieces, nos. 1 and 6, are strongly weighted, and the inner frame pieces, nos. 2 and 5, more moderately weighted, while the percent values of the inner pieces, nos. 3 and 4, lie significantly below the average (15.2/18.9; 5.0/6.8 (29) ). As Schleiermacher’s overall conception of the piece implies broader tempi, the absolute durations of these inner movements are only slightly below the mean duration (no. 3: 0:55/0:59; no. 4: 0:18/0:21). A clear difference between the percent values of the frame pieces and those of the inner pieces is also most clearly pronounced for Schleiermacher (a minimal difference of 7.9 lies between the shorter frame value, for no. 1, at 25.8% and the longest inner value, for no. 2, at 17.9%).",

                "text": "[3.5] Other examples of the frame model tend towards what we will generally call the contrast model (see [3.11]). This model is characterized by a single, or sometimes several sharp tempo contrasts between individual pieces. In Claude Helffer (1969) for example, the durations of nos. 1, 2, 3, and 6 converge to such a degree (percent values between 19.6 and 22.9, in total 84.5%), that nos. 4 (0:20/0:21; 6.4/6.8) and 5 (0:29/0:29; 9.0/9.2) stand out markedly in their relative brevity, although they are very close to the mean values (Example 7). This requires a rather slow interpretation of the second (1:05/0:54) and third pieces (1:02/0:59), and a relatively faster interpretation of the first (1:13/1:16) and sixth pieces (1:09/1:14). Perhaps such a conception, in which the durations of nos. 1, 2, 3, and 6 converge, can also be likened to Barthes’s conception of a “cycle of fragments,” insofar as it in fact leads to a lack of clear macroformal architecture—maybe with the exception of the contrastive function of the fourth and fifth pieces. [3.6] The opening model and finale model can be understood as variants of the frame model, accentuating the first and final movement respectively. The opening model is particularly pronounced in six recordings; here the highest percent values in the first piece (mean: 24.5) coincide with the maximal differences between the percent values of the first and sixth pieces (mean: 1.2): Majlingová 1977 (31.8; difference 12.3 (30) ), Harris 1951 (31.1; 14.8), Dünki 2005 (29.2; 10.6), Zykan 1970 (28.9; 7.9), Kadosa 1958 (28.6; 9.3), and Kraus 1960 (26.7; 7.6). Of these, only Johana Harris (maximum duration at 1:37/1:16; main tempo 57.1/87.6 (31) ) and Lýdia Majlingová (1:33/1:16; 70.5/87.6) give the first piece a halting, dream-like character. (32) In the case of Jean-Jacques Dünki (1:24/1:16; 71.8/87.6 (33) ), the intention of achieving a transparent formal structure through small breaks and by letting the cadencing chords resonate is audible, (34) although a “flowing movement in the style of a romantic barcarole” [ fließende Bewegung in der Art einer romantischen Barcarole ] ( Dünki 2006 , 122) should predominate. For Dünki as well as Pál Kadosa (1:13/1:16; 89.1/87.6), Otto Zykan (1:10/1:16; 92.7/87.6), and Else C. Kraus (1:06/1:16; 82.7/87.6 (35) ), the opening model is part of a fast, synoptic interpretation of the cycle (total durations Kadosa 4:16, Zykan 4:01, Kraus: 4:07, Dünki: 4:49; mean 5:13).

(36) Despite this difference, the opening model is distinctive in both Kraus and Dünki ( Example 8 ): the quick, fleeting character of their interpretations of the following five pieces (clearly more extreme in Kraus than in Dünki) underscores the variety and structural complexity of the first piece as a distinguishing characteristic. The swift conception of the second piece—a contrasting moment that strengthens the solemn prominence of the first piece—is a crucial factor here. Example 9 .

The finale model is particularly pronounced where a high percent value of the sixth piece accompanies a particularly low percent value of the first piece. As already suggested above, Mitsuko Uchida 2000 illustrates this case particularly clearly (difference 13.9; (37) no. 1: 18.2/24.5; 1:21/1:16; 105.0/87.6 bpm; (38) no. 6: 32.1/23.3; 2:22/1:14; 18.6/39.0 bpm) ( Example 9 ).

The music comes to a standstill; the palpably solemn, commemorative character—quasi in memoriam Mahler—gives Uchida’s no. 6 an unambiguous extraterritoriality. In nos. 3 and 5, Uchida also reaches very long durations, both of which near the respective maxima. However, the percent values for these movements are hardly conspicuous, as they are neutralized by the extreme expansiveness of no. 6. Aleksei Liubimov 1971 (Example 9), like Kraus and Dünki and in contrast to Uchida, takes a quicker than average interpretation as a starting point, especially in no. 1, where his main tempo is the fastest of all recordings considered (132.0/87.6 (39) ), as well as in no. 4 (0:17/0:21) and no. 5 (0:22/0:29), whose contrastive characters are preserved by means of a comparatively slow no. 3 (1:00/0:59). A commonality between Liubimov and Uchida is the similarity of the percent values for nos. 1, 2, and 3 (Uchida: 18.2–16.3–17.9; Liubimov: 19.3–18.0–21.2), which gives rise to a tripartite grouping 1–3/4–5/6 (Liubimov) and 1–3/4/5–6 (Uchida). [3.10] The consequence of a relatively short length of no. 1 is thus, inversely to the opening model, that the first piece moves closer to the inner pieces in duration, or can even be exceeded by them. A particularly spectacular example of this is Christoph Eschenbach 2000, the only recording where the second piece is longer than the first (no. 1: 1:23/1:16; no. 2: 1:25/0:54). Thus Uchida’s and Eschenbach’s interpretations effectively mirror the distinctive manifestations of the opening model: they forego a sharp contrast in the fourth and fifth pieces and assimilate the durations of the first three, so that—despite a generally slow overall tempo—the solemn character of the final piece is particularly forceful (Uchida: 1:21–1:12–1:19–0:22–0:46– 2:22 ; Eschenbach: 1:23–1:25–1:15–0:24–0:37– 1:38 ). A further interpretational strategy recognizable here is the formation of (a) an axis 1–3 (in Liubimov the third piece, at 1:00, is longer than the first, at 0:55), (b) 3–6 (the respective approaches in representatives of the opening model), or (c) a three-part framing 1–3–6.",

This model can take on various forms, but usually proceeds by sharpening the expanded frame model 1–3–6. These three movements tend to be strongly weighted in some recordings, with nos. 2 and/or 4 and 5 forming striking contrasts. This model thus must be distinguished from various contrast effects described above, which function as part of the models already laid out: shortening no. 2 reinforces the opening model, shortening nos. 4 and 5 the finale model, and a general shortening of the inner movements is characteristic of the frame model. The condition of an autonomous contrast model is thus a distinctive similarity in the durations of nos. 1, 3, and 6, whose architectonic pillar function is strengthened by contrasting intermezzi, nos. 2, 4, and 5.

                "text": "[3.12] Paul Jacobs’s recording from 1958 is the only example in which the third piece is longer than both the first and sixth ( 01:15 –01:07– 01:25 –00:15–00:26– 01:12 ). The extreme contrast between the third piece, with the longest duration of all the recordings (1:25/0:59), and the fourth piece, with the shortest (0:15/0:21), gives particularly forceful expression to the caesura function of the fourth piece, as described in the analytical outline above ( see [2.7] ). This recording is however not paradigmatic of the contrast model, as Jacobs takes the second piece somewhat slowly. Unmistakable is the contrast model in Herbert Henck 1994 ( 24.7 –13.8– 23.3 –5.6–5,6– 26.9 ; total duration 5:19), and clear also in Aribert Reimann 1984 ( 23.6 –13.9– 21.5 –6.0–9.1– 25.9 ; total duration 5:12). Example 10 shows how this model takes shape in these two recordings in comparison to the average tempo-values. A difference between Henck and Reimann is the handling of the fifth piece, which in Reimann, as in almost all recordings, is taken more broadly than the fourth (4: 0:19/0:21; 5: 0:28/0:29). In Henck however, the durations of nos. 4 and 5 are identical (5.6%, 0:18), which necessitates an extremely fast tempo in no. 5 (197.2/141.6) and thus sharpens the contrast between nos. 5 and 6. (40) Example 11 . Op. 19, accelerando model; tempo curves for Sanromá 1937, Steuermann 1963, and Gould 1965 (click to enlarge) [3.13] Finally, the accelerando model most distinctively follows the principal of a “large arc” ( Example 11 ). Jesús María Sanromá’s early recording (1937) shows it in especially “pure” form: in nos. 1 through 5, each piece is shorter and thus proportionally less weighted than the previous, with balance restored only by the sixth piece ( 24.0 –20.5–18.0–7.7–6.8– 23.1 ; 1:04–0:54–0:48–0:20–0:18–1:01; total duration 4:25). Thus, in a certain way, the compositional process is reproduced, in which nos. 1–5 were composed in one go. This conception requires a relatively broad tempo for no. 1, accentuating the expositional character of this movement; a rather brisk, “anti-romantic” concept of no. 3—this being the essential difference from the contrast model; and possibly (only in Sanromá 1937 and Boffard 2013) a final outpacing of no. 4 by no. 5. This model, as is clearly the case in Sanromá, can allude to the frame model: the sixth piece balances a weightier beginning after an intermediate, accelerating chain of events. This can also be seen in Steuermann 1963 ( 23,1 –17,3–15,2–6,9–13,0– 24,5 ; 1:04–0:48–0:42–0:19–0:36–1:08; total 4:37; see Example 11) where, however, the expansion of no. 5 gives rise to a specific, highly individual dramaturgy (explored in detail in section 4 below) that should not be reduced to any of the five models. Other recordings tending towards the accelerando model shape the sixth piece significantly shorter than the first, and thus carry the momentum of the accelerando into the final piece, especially Florent Boffard 2013 ( 24.6 –20.0–21.4–7.7–6.6– 19.7 ; 1:16–1:02–1:06–0:24–0:20–1:01; total 5:09). This tendency is also recognizable in Steuermann 1957a ( 25.7 –18.1–15.5–7.5–11.7– 21.5 ; 1:08–0:48–0:41–0:20–0:31–0:57; total 4:25). Glenn Gould 1965, in contrast, occupies rather an intermediate position between the accelerando and frame models ( 26.6 –19.9–15.3–5.9–8.0– 24.3 ; 1:23–1:02–0:48–0:18–0:25–1:16; total 5:13). The graph of relative tempo (Example 11, lower diagram) makes Gould’s unorthodox tempo-shaping particularly clear, above all in pieces 1–4 (see section 4).",

The recordings that conform particularly strongly to any one of these models might well distinguish themselves by certain details, perhaps eccentricities, which surely does not preclude that they plausibly unveil layers of meaning in the work. We would also like to point again to the relationship between the models and the absolute tempo. On the one hand, most models are less able to take a distinctive shape in the fast basic tempi of the earlier recordings than in slower recordings, which allow a greater variance in the tempo and duration. On the other hand, some models correlate closely to the choice of absolute tempi. In this way, it can be established that a clear expression of the frame model requires a slower tempo, so that the framing pieces can be sufficiently weighted. Among representatives of the opening model in contrast, a cluster of generally faster recordings is found (Kraus 1960, Zykan 1970, Dünki 2005), while conversely in the finale model a cluster of especially slow approaches can be observed (Uchida 2000, Eschenbach 2000). Of course, these are merely general tendencies and do not preclude alternative tempo conceptions. In fact, some of the most striking tempo conceptions have yet to be mentioned. For example, the fastest of all considered recordings by Karl Steiner from 1962 cannot be adequately described by any of the presented models. The percent values in Steiner are consistently so close to the average that they reveal no specific emphasis, with the exception of a slight displacement from the framing pieces to the middle pieces (23.0/24.5; 19.9/17.3; 19.1/18.9; 7.7/6.8; 9.6/9.2; 20.7/23.3). This recording thus shows itself to be an extremely fast variant of a standard dramaturgy formed across decades, falling under the mean duration values with a clear consistency (0:55/1:16; 0:47/0:54; 0:45/0:59; 0:18/0:21; 0:23/0:29; 0:49/1:14; total 3:58/5:13).",

At the same time, the fast basic tempo prevents the “didactic” demonstration of structural details that is characteristic of many later recordings.

                "text": "[4.4] The phrase structure of the piece is already compositionally clearly marked by a number of factors, including silences (mm. 2.1, 4.4, 12.2), phrasing slurs and/or reduced density of movement (mm. 3.3, 5.4), as well as modifications of tempo at three places, amounting to a compositional elaboration of phrase arching (45) —that is, a sequence of tempo-dynamic arches (especially evident in mm. 2, 11, 13, 14). Steuermann’s tempo-curve shows on the whole a somewhat steeper progression than the average of the compared recordings (Example 12: mm. 1.3–1.4, 2.2–2.6, 6.2–6.3, 10.1–10.4, 14.6–15.4), a sign of deliberately shaping the phrasing through rubato, through “half and quarter cadences” ( 1942 ), which should make the musical units comprehensible to the listener. At times however, a path markedly narrower than the average of the other recordings is evident (mm. 10.4–15.1), which can be understood as evidence of an effort to maintain the main tempo in the course of the transition from the development to the recapitulation. The composed-out phrasing rubato of the first two bars in the slur placement, silence (m. 2.1), tempo, and dynamic markings (m. 2: “etwas zögernd”; hairpin to m. 2.4), (46) is realized by Steuermann not only through a reduction in tempo in the second half of each measure, as in the other recordings, but also through an accelerando in the first half. Similarly, all of the Steuermann recordings make the silence in m. 4.4 very clear. The following (fourth) phrase is outlined by a wavelike accelerando up to the beginning of m. 6, followed by an extreme slowdown. This slowdown, to less than half of the main tempo (mean value 41.6) in mm. 6.2–6.3 is explained, on the one hand, by a large-scale formal caesura and, on the other hand, by the desire to realize the complex polyphonic articulation in this passage (legato and staccato at the same time in the right hand). (This is realized particularly impressively in the studio recording from 1963; see Laubhold 2018 , 81).",

                "text": "[4.6] The crescendo in m. 9 in the left hand remains unrealized in all six Steuermann recordings. Rather the pianissimo is held, probably so as not to cover the melodic line A3–G3 in the crossing right hand, although only in the studio recording from 1963 is the G3 played more loudly than the A3, suggesting a crescendo at least in the melodic line. In the following “discharging” motion (mm. 11–12), Steuermann again departs markedly from the mean value of the other recordings, doubtless with the intention of preempting the danger of a “disruption” of the piece, referred to in his letter to Gielen, that would arise through “tempo cadences” that were too frequent or too strong ( 1942 ). This particularly suggests that the reason for the tempo reduction in m. 6 may well be less the intention to produce a large-scale formal caesura than a technically contingent fine-tuning. In the same way, the acceleration in mm. 15.4–16.2, massive compared to those of the other recordings, can be explained technically by the desire not to let the high chord E5– G ♯ 5– D ♯ 6 fade entirely, so that the change to its chromatic neighbor chord in m. 17.5 can be followed by the ear ( Laubhold 2018 , 76–77). (Only in the recordings from 1954 and 1963 can this actually be heard, as a result of a particularly drastic increase in tempo.) Example 13 . Op. 19, no. 1, mean tempi of the three sections mm. 1–6, mm. 7–12 (the value for mm. 7–8.2 is given additionally), and mm. 13–17 in Steuermann’s six recordings and ten compared recordings (1925–2018) (click to enlarge) [4.7] A relationship between these details and the larger form is first established by Steuermann’s tripartite shaping of the tempo, with a strong acceleration in mm. 7–10 (clearly evident in Example 12) and his return to the starting tempo in m. 13, which conveys the sense of a recapitulation. (47) Although the tempo does not remain steady neither at the beginning (due to the fragmentation of the phrases and the many tempo modifications such as “etwas zögernd” in m. 2) nor in the “recapitulation” (m. 14 already contains a “molto rit.,” though this can be understood as analogous to m. 2), the correspondence between Steuermann’s chosen tempo-regions is nonetheless striking in comparison with the middle section. This is especially remarkable when compared with the other recordings, as Example 13 demonstrates. A slow–fast–slow dramaturgy can be found in many but far from all recordings; it is particularly clear in Pollini 1974, Henck 1994, and Körber 2018. Compared to this, “unorthodox” recordings such as Gould 1965, Liubimov 1971, and Majlingová 1977 reveal significantly less defined architectonic conceptions, and in many cases (Gould is exemplary along these lines), no clear articulation of sections can be found at all.",

Here, Steuermann’s effort is recognizable to return immediately to the region of the main tempo after such accelerandi, much in the sense of preserving a “unity of tempo” (see Example 12, mm. 7.2.2, 8.2–10.2), and thus to shape the accelerando exclusively as a formal marker of contrasting moments (contrasting theme in m. 7, “fleeting” (“flüchtig”) figures in mm. 8.1 and 10.1.2).

(49) Here individual factors are identified that are characteristic for a portion of the recordings. The pattern matrix then shows to what extent the individual recordings conform to these factors. In each of the six pieces, there is a primary factor, which strongly characterizes the majority of the interpretations (one could perhaps venture the hypothesis that this primary factor is largely determined by the musical text—a strong external guideline that in a way molds all of the interpretations), as well as between one and three further factors, mostly applicable to only a smaller portion of the recordings. Correlation with the primary factor is particularly strong in the second piece, which is hardly surprising given the rigid ostinato tempo that both characterizes the entire piece and allows for only marginal deviations.

The interpretation that most closely correlates with the primary factor, Henck 1994, moves—unsurprisingly—in strong synchrony with the average values within a narrow frame, yet not without significant departures: the less pronounced caesura before the transitional theme in m. 4.5, the tightening of the tempo after the “flüchtig” figure at the end of m. 10 before the ritardando in m. 11, and above all the strong reduction in tempo in the concluding section and corresponding slip in the main tempo ( Example 16 ). Inverse to this is Majlingová 1977, where the extreme swings in the tempo curve in the first section imply a character of “losing oneself,” a world away from Steuermann’s phrase-oriented interpretation. The particularly strong correlation between Steuermann’s and Pollini’s recordings suggested by Example 14 is understandable, notwithstanding Pollini’s narrower adherence to the main tempo in m. 2 and in the “flüchtig” figures, compared to Steuermann.",

Her curve shows several significant differences from Steuermann’s, the most important being a rather restrained tempo in the contrasting theme and a sharp tightening of the final phase of the piece. Her extreme vacillations at the beginning are less concisely aligned to the phrase structure than are Steuermann’s, and neither the ritardando in m. 1.4 nor the abrupt accelerandi in mm. 3.1 and 6.1 can be understood as phrasing rubato in a structural sense. Although not to such an extreme extent as that of Majlingová, Kraus’s interpretation can be seen as a document of a more irrational and spontaneous shaping of the rubato, considerably less text-oriented than Steuermann’s.

This is surely one reason why so many analyses have been dedicated to this piece. (50) From a pianistic approach, a doubtlessly crucial challenge lies in bringing out the opposition between the ostinato thirds, which are to be played “äußerst kurz” (extremely short) and “gut im Takt” (strictly in time), and the expressive thematic gestures in m. 3 (with upbeat) and m. 6. Particularly interesting is that these two layers do not remain uninfluenced by one another, but rather the articulation and rhythmic regularity of the ostinato is affected by the expressive figures, so that in mm. 4 and 5 the appoggiatura-like emphasis of the figure from m. 3 penetrates into the ostinato (in the form of the tenuto eighth note C5- E ♭ 5). Chords and chordal combinations based on major and minor thirds (sometimes referred to as “gamma harmonies”; see Ernő 1971 , 35–66)—for example B-D- D ♯ - F ♯ in m. 3 with upbeat, or G- B ♭ - B ♮ -D in the final chord, both of which belong to set class [0347]—and related ambiguous harmonies continually lead to new colorations of the ostinato third G4-B4. Formally, the piece is characterized by a question and answer pattern of the contrasting (and directionally opposite) melodic gestures of mm. 3 and 6, while mm. 1–2 can be understood as an introduction and mm. 7–9 as an epilogue to this thematic dialogue, and mm. 4–5 as a double echo of the first figure. Furthermore, a variation of a lamento topos connects mm. 5–9 (partly chromatically descending progression from G-B to C-E).",

                "text": "[4.16] A particularly conspicuous departure from the score is Steuermann’s accent on the high third B5-D6 in the upbeat to m. 3, mentioned also in his letter to Gielen (“I don’t mind to ‘connect’ the melody tones by a fresher impuls[e] in the first tones, but I am often criticized for such things”; 1942 ). Indeed, in all six of the recordings both of the eighth notes in this upbeat are strongly emphasized, although the accentuation of the high third is much more prominent and doubtless employed by Steuermann as a deliberate moment of surprise, an interpretation not totally at odds with Schoenberg’s mf , although Steuermann plays more of a decrescendo than a crescendo between the two eighths. Schoenberg had in fact wrestled with the nuancing of the dynamics at just this spot; a lengthy note on the realization of the dynamics and accents was planned in the autograph fair copy of this piece, but ultimately not included in the printed version: > or sf always indicates only a small emphasis, adjusted to the context. This emphasis may be stronger than the emphasis the beat in question would receive naturally, but must be differentiated from spots marked mfp , fp , mfpp , fpp , or even ffpp , where individual notes should really stick out from their surroundings due to their intensity and then immediately return to as before, perhaps through immediate muting. (51) Undoubtedly, this note refers particularly to the interposed arpeggiated chord in the high register at the beginning of m. 5 (highest note F ♭ 6), which forms, with the high third ( B ♮ 5-D6) in the upbeat to m. 3 and the final chord (highest note D6), a macroformal neighbor tone across the entire piece (D6- F ♭ 6-D6). Schoenberg changed the duration of this chord in the autograph fair copy from an eighth to a sixteenth; at the same time, the accent present in the first autograph in the right hand is missing in the fair copy (the accent in the “appoggiatura” figure in the left hand, however, is retained). It is possible that Schoenberg was concerned that this chord could be articulated too sharply; nonetheless the accent was eventually included in the printed version. (52) The planned instruction, however, could also indirectly refer to the upbeat to m. 3, specifically to the relationship between the mf with crescendo and the p in the following measure. Steuermann’s efforts to establish this p immediately are particularly successful in the recording from 1963. And although he plays the chord in m. 5.1 very restrainedly, the necessary shortness (sixteenth note) and the staccato of the immediately following third F ♯ 3- A ♯ 3 is not consequently realized, as the chord from m. 5.1 continues to sound in the pedal (except in the recording from 1949). This lets the continuity between the thirds G ♭ 5- B ♭ 5 (m. 5.1) and F ♯ 3- A ♯ 3 (m. 5.2), a secondary structural layer, emerge more clearly. Steuermann’s decisions against the text can arguably be understood as a conscious “reading between the lines,” which aims to bring hidden layers of meaning in the music to the surface.

For the first thematic figure, for example, the low point of the tempo curve of the 40 other recordings falls in m. 3.1 and not, as in Steuermann, in m. 2.4; the extreme elongation of the upbeat eighth note is thus tendentially replaced by a tenuto on the arrival note D ♯ 4 in m. 3 by most performers, while Steuermann plays this note “a tempo.” The expressive stretching of this first thematic figure in the middle of m. 3 is also much stronger in the majority of the compared recordings than in Steuermann’s; he foregrounds the regularity of the ostinato, which continues in parallel. Also conspicuous in comparison to the other recordings is Steuermann’s broadening of mm. 5.1–5.2 (contributing to his “reading between the lines” at this point) and his efforts, at least suggested, to take the beginning of the answering figure (m. 6) close to the main tempo.

The factor analysis (Example 15) confirms that, despite the discussed peculiarities, Steuermann’s tempo conception is largely representative of a general trend. This is also evidenced by the many correlation values above 0.8 (Example 14) as well as the close correlation between the tempo curves of Steuermann 1963 and Beveridge Webster 1967 (Example 18); in the factor analysis, Webster’s interpretation shows the strongest correlation with the primary factor (Example 15).

Steuermann’s interpretation assumes a middle position, in which both of these aspects coexist. The possibility of nuanced shadings is shown, for example, by his realization of the arrival chord in m. 6.3, whose dissonant effect is brought out in the recordings from 1954 and 1963 by the strong presence of the lower notes of the chord.

On the other hand, the form has a clear two-part structure (which does not fundamentally contradict the first interpretation): the silence at the beginning of m. 5 interrupts the thick texture of the first four measures and is followed by an increasingly thin texture with a tendency toward the isolation of the melodic voice (mm. 6.2–6.4, 7.2–8.3) and calming of the rhythm.

Their most conspicuous characteristic is the tempo caesura at the end of m. 2, which is much more prominent than in the 40 compared recordings (Example 19). Steuermann thus accentuates the two-part structure of this “compound basic idea,” allowing him to differentiate the dynamics correspondingly: the dynamic highpoint within the pp of the left hand in m. 3.1 must be on a perceptibly quieter level than the surrounding chords of the right hand in mm. 2.4 and 3.2 for the polyphonic layering to come across clearly. This becomes even clearer with Steuermann’s accentuation of the chords in the right hand—analogous to the prominently emphasized beginning of the theme in no. 2 (upbeat to m. 3): the first downbeat chord is forcefully marked in all six recordings and then on the second beat held back, once more against Schoenberg’s written dynamics ( crescendo from m. 1.1 to m. 1.2). Especially in the recording 1957a, an important modification is the absence of a caesura in m. 4 (on the other hand, the suspension-like resolution C- B ♭ in the left hand is broadened, especially in 1949; Example 19 shows this also to be a characteristic, if less distinctively, of the 40 compared recordings). The two parts of the piece are thus brought together in one “arc,” and the interpretation as a coherent “theme” becomes audibly plausible—especially due to the brisk tempo. In the second half of Steuermann’s interpretation, compressions result particularly from a shortening of the two held notes E ♭ 4 in m. 6.2 (half note) and m. 7.2 (dotted quarter note). These features cannot be found in the curve of the other 40 recordings shown in Example 19 and can thus be considered further evidence of Steuermann’s sustained efforts to render the course of the piece in a single , synoptic motion. Overall, however, a strong correlation between Steuermann’s curve and the averages of the compared recordings is clear. Example 20 .

The factors are however markedly more divergent than in no. 2, as the significantly lower correlation coefficients show (mean value = 0.472, in contrast to 0.756 in no. 2; see Example 14). The comparative tempo diagram ( Example 20 ) shows a certain correlation between the curves of Steuermann and Liubimov 1971 (the two recordings correspond in the high value of the primary factor and beyond this in a similar value for factor 4)—with the exception that Liubimov does not shorten the held E ♭ s in mm. 6 and 7. Factor 3, introduced by Pollini 1974, could be explained by an alternative phrasing of the basic idea contrary to the primary factor, recognizable in a certain negative correlation to Liubimov 1971 and Steuermann 1963. (55) Gould’s eccentric interpretation of no. 3, which we discuss in detail elsewhere ( Utz and Glaser 2020 , 194–96), can be seen in every way as the antithesis of Steuermann’s. Gould hardly subdivides the idea in mm. 1–4, instead leading it through a sort of continuous ritardando from an extremely fast beginning (the peak in m. 1.4 is 88.9 bpm, the low point in m. 4.4 at 34.4 bpm) to a very held back and thus strongly contrasting second part (also here with extreme fluctuations between 61.2 and 28.1 bpm). That factor 2 is dependent above all on such tempo contrasts between the two parts is reflected in the high values for comparable conceptions such as Serkin 2009 or Vintschger 1970 and in the high negative values (Barenboim 1994, Kraus 1960, Sherman 1999, Wyttenbach 1989) for contrary conceptions (slow first part, fast second part). Eschenbach’s factor 4 could be connected above all with the stately absolute tempo (28.1 bpm), which is brought to a virtual standstill in m. 4 (m. 4.1: 18.3 bpm), and additionally tends to a “spelling out” of melodic tones, a decision that, especially in the second part, leads to a leveled curve. In the process, minute differentiations in the articulation come into their own—for example, in the upbeat to m. 8, where the series tenuto – ordinario – staccato under a legato-slur is particularly elegantly shaped by Eschenbach. Pollini also realizes this detail very convincingly, though he minimizes the caesura, in a manner reminiscent of Steuermann, who consistently passes over this phrasing and takes mm. 7 and 8 in a single arc (followed here by Gould 1965)—also evidence of Steuermann’s synoptic tendency in this piece.",

It contrasts particularly starkly with the preceding piece, no. 3, in tempo and character, and it is not, unlike the five other pieces, connected to the preceding or following piece by neighbor note relationships between the final and beginning harmonies. Furthermore, the monophony and high register of its beginning represent a clear contrast to what came before. The scherzando character of the piece establishes itself in the double-dotted rhythm of m. 1 (referring back to the “secondary theme” of no. 1), the staccato articulation in mm. 3–4 (heightened to martellato in m. 10), and the unexpected grace notes, twists, and stops (in mm. 4–5 and 8–9, the development seems to spin off into nothingness, both times initiated by a “poco rit.”). (56) A relationship in the pitch structure of mm. 10–13 and mm. 1–5 has been frequently noted (see especially Morris 1993 ), and a structural recapitulation in the pitches can been uncovered here as in no. 1 under the differing musical surfaces. The tripartite form is also reinforced by the contrasting gentler (trio) theme in mm. 6–9 (with upbeat), which is nonetheless related to the outer parts—for example, in the grace note on m. 6.1, which corresponds to the “harpsichord accents” before m. 2.2 and after m. 8.2 ( Fearn 2002 , 278). The final consequence of these grace-note-like accents is the striking final cadence, which seems to settle what had been left open in mm. 5 and 9. Yet the “openness” of the tonal configuration of this ending, despite the leading-tone-like B ♭ 3 [ A ♯ 3]- B ♮ 3 (mm. 12–13), provides a connection to no. 5: here, the beginning F major melodic gesture in the right hand corresponds to the beginning notes of no. 4 (mm. 1–2; see also mm. 10–11), so that the tritone B-F, much in accordance with a basic principle of early atonal harmony, manifests a dominant function—or at least a particularly close pitch relationship (this tritone also forms the upper segment of the penultimate accord, m. 12.2).

The remainder of the compared recordings proceeds analogously to Steuermann, including a shortening of the quarter rest in m. 9.2. Striking in Steuermann’s is the tendency to return to the main tempo in m. 6, while the average of the other recordings remains at a lower tempo plateau. The increase in tempo during the cadence, which intensifies the composed accelerando in m. 10, and particularly the abbreviation (near deletion) of the eighth rest in m. 11.2, is also more pronounced in Steuermann’s performance than in the compared recordings, strengthening the “clean sweep” character of this ending. At the same time, Steuermann’s tempi are significantly above the mean for the compared recordings (106.0/93.9), although the studio recording 1957a distinguishes itself with a more restrained tempo (96.3). On the whole, Steuermann offers an end-oriented interpretation achieved by a separation of the first phrase (mm. 1–5) and a synoptic tendency during the remainder of the piece, compressing the tempo up until the end.

The underlying topos here is the waltz, although various metrical “disturbances” and ambiguities establish relationships to the scherzando character of no. 4 and also no. 1—for example, in the suggestion of a siciliano rhythm in mm. 7–8 (as well as in the relationship between the respective 8 3 and 8 6 meters and the eighth note pulse). Such relationships, as well as the striking final cadence, which spans four measures and extends conclusively across a wide register, may suggest that this piece could have been originally conceived as a final piece, especially considering, as mentioned above, that no. 6 was written only about four months after the first five pieces, which were written down in a single day. Formally, no. 5 is more complex and seems to have been conceived less architectonically (as was no. 4) than processually. A subject head is not followed by a proper continuation or answer; rather, the motion halts in the sustained tones of mm. 4–6, and the “attempt” at a cadence by means of the siciliano rhythm in mm. 7–8 comes to an abrupt end (m. 8.2), which in its five-voiced quintal chord also proves to be a kind of harmonic dead end ( F ♯ 2-C3-G3-D4-A4). The melodic motion resumes again in m. 9 and above all in m. 10, reminiscent of the beginning (as if driven by the staccato sixteenth notes in the left hand) and is then interrupted again by the silence in m. 12.1. The falling cadence, which begins with a sudden forte and change in register, concentrates the principle of layered thirds from no. 2 into a veritable tower of sonorities, leading to two chromatically linked final chords (with a certain polytonality of “tonic” and “dominant” in the final chord E-major 6/4 / B-major 9/7). Here too, the vagrant motivic outline, the frequent interruptions, and the abruptness of the phrases can be understood as manifestations of a scherzando or perhaps better, capriccio character.

While this leads undoubtedly to a specific dramaturgy that allows no. 5 more space and thus establishes a first element of closure, it contradicts Steuermann’s suggestion in his letter to Gielen of 144 bpm, which corresponds almost exactly to the mean value of the 40 compared recordings (142.4 bpm). This can be explained through closer examination of the tempo curves of Steuermann’s interpretations (Example 23): if only the first two measures are considered, the resulting values come close to or exceed the tempo given in the letter: 144.6 (1949), 138.7 (1954), 146.3 (1957a), 165.2 (1957b), 179.1 (1962), and 154.0 (1963).

Then, however, with strong slowdowns in mm. 3 and 4, Steuermann establishes a new halting tempo, which one can understand as an imaginative realization of the thematic “faltering” in this passage. Finally, with the metrical irritation caused by the siciliano rhythm, the tempo loses all momentum, and the motion comes entirely to a halt at an average tempo of 42.7 bpm (m. 8.2). The following passage (mm. 9–11) then returns to the tempo plateau of mm. 5–6 (and not mm. 1–2), followed by the cadence’s gradual reduction in tempo corresponding to the “poco a poco rit.” (m. 12.2).",

This of course can give rise to something like an imaginary pulse, which the calculated average tempo values may be understood to approximate (m. 9, dramatically slowed in nearly all the recordings, is excluded from the calculation of these values). Steuermann’s absolute tempo values are very close to the average of the compared recordings (40.0/39.0; see Example 2), although the fluctuations reach maximal values both in his six interpretations (34.8–44.6 bpm, where the relative standard deviation = 9.5%) and in the compared recordings (18.6–62.1 bpm, where the relative standard deviation = 25.0%; Example 2). Correspondingly, the mean correlation value is lowest for this piece (0.354;  Example 14). The large divergences can also be seen clearly in Example 25 . The absolute durations of Steuermann’s recordings diverge more strongly than their similar main tempi might lead one to expect, between 0:57 in the recording 1957a and 1:17 in 1949 (Example 2).",

(60) Ultimately, Steuermann’s tendency to produce a two-part form through a large tempo cadence (here mm. 1–6/7–9) and to subsume especially the second part in a superordinate synoptic development, is recognizable here, as in the other pieces; this also explains the abbreviation of the silence in mm. 8.2–8.3. A comparison with the mean values of the other recordings (Example 25) highlights this specific dramaturgy in Steuermannʼs recordings. The return to the main tempo in m. 9, which Steuermann prescribed in his letter to Gielen, (61) (analogously to the return of the beginning tempo in m. 13 of no. 1, see [4.7–4.8] ), however, remains unrealized in all recordings. At most, an attempt at this is recognizable in the recording 1957a; with 37.6 bpm, however, the value of the beginning (47.6 bpm) here is still far from equaled. Example 26 .

The following upper-neighbor figure is then already dramatically slower (35.9 bpm), and m. 6 drops further to 24.2 bpm.

Yet as a whole, it remains unparalleled in the history of the work’s performance. Even the recordings by Steiner and Chen, which have similar values to Steuermann in the factor analysis and whose (relative) shaping of the tempo correlates unambiguously with Steuermann’s, produce an utterly different impression. This is above all due to the different choice of absolute tempo. Steiner’s extraordinarily restless interpretation necessarily leads to a fleeting and, at times, almost careless sequence of events, particularly during the motivic elements of mm. 7 and 8. A world away from this, Chen achieves a powerful calmness at the beginning that seems appropriate for the character of the piece; however her extreme stretching of m. 6 and stark abbreviation of mm. 7 and 8 then lead to the impression of a disconcerting contrast that boarders on incoherence. Steuermann, in contrast, finds a balance between a synoptic tempo conception, which renders the piece in its global coherence, and a nuanced shaping of the tempo in mm. 6 and 7–8, by which he sets a formal marker also rhetorically justified by the speech-like gesture of mm. 7–8, without producing the effect of an “external object.” His articulation of the chords, however, cannot be considered entirely successful, as the overly direct sound, which can also be observed in the case of the chords at the beginning of no. 3, cannot solely be attributed to the direct miking, at least in the studio recording from 1963. (63) The chords in mm. 2.3 and 5.3 are especially articulated in a way that is hardly consistent with the pieceʼs character. (64) It would therefore be misleading to present Steuermann’s interpretation as an unreachable ideal; rather, this interpretation shows an inexhaustible wealth of dimensions and potentials, which are constantly transformed and updated in the course of the performance history. 5.

Can a “Steuermann factor” be clearly distinguished from global tendencies in the majority of other available recordings, as has been done for the playing of Vladimir Horowitz, for example?

And finally, where does Steuermann stand between the poles of “rhetorical” and “structuralist performance” ( Cook 2013 , 5 and 41–55), or between “ espressivo ” and “ neo-objective interpretation” ( Stenzl 1995 , 687–92)? On the basis of the comparative investigations presented here, the most important characteristics of Steuermann’s interpretation will once again be recapitulated for the discussion of these questions and illustrated in one final graph, which presents Steuermann’s 1963 recording alongside four important compared recordings (Kraus 1960, Gould 1965, Pollini 1974, and Henck 1994) over the course of all six pieces ( Example 27 ).

(67) A brisk tempo is admittedly a general characteristic of earlier recordings before 1970—this is evident not least in Kraus and Steiner, who were close to the Schoenberg School. And the focus of Schoenberg’s criticism of the first performances of op. 19 on the excessive speed, and thus lack of attention to structural detail, is certainly not accidental ( see [2.9] )). Precisely this attention to detail, described by Adorno ( [1964] 1982 ) and Laubhold ( 2018 as the defining characteristic of Steuermann’s playing, combined with the brisk tempo, leads to a close relationship between part and whole, as was undoubtedly the pianist’s goal. The balance struck between a strong emphasis on smaller units of meaning through (phrasing) rubato on the one hand, and the orientation towards the main tempo, on the other hand, is what allows an interplay of “rhetorical” and “structuralist” performance to take place, a balance claimed for the Schoenberg school by Rudolf Kolisch under the slogan “Wiener espressivo.” (68)",

Similarly, in no. 6 the intended return to the beginning tempo in the final measure was left unrealized in favor of a general fading away.

This can be clearly identified in each case: m. 6 in no. 1, m. 6.3 in no. 2, m. 4 in no. 3, m. 4 in no. 4, m. 8.2 in no. 5, and m. 6.1 in no. 6. Especially in nos. 1, 3, and 5, further significant form-shaping elements are put on a level with these macroformal incisions: in no. 1, the contrast of the “secondary theme” is underlined by the intensification of the tempo (m. 7); in no. 3, the shortening of the caesura in the large-scale form (m. 4) acts in favor of a single thematic “idea” encompassing the entire piece; and in no. 5, the rallentando dramaturgy just mentioned contributes to the impression of an overarching tempo dramaturgy. The comprehensibility produced by the interaction of these elements of shaping (and in this case further underpinned by the brevity of the pieces) for Schoenberg was a basic requirement of composition as well as performance: “every idea must be presented so that the listener’s power of comprehension can follow it” ( Schoenberg 1934/36 , 55; (69) see also Feß 2018 , 40). The Society for Private Musical Performances [ Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen ], in which Steuermann, as “Director of Performance” [ Vortragsmeister ], played a leading role, made accordingly high demands on the “clarity, sound, and plasticity of the presentation.” (70) A characterization of Steuermann’s approach to op. 19 as form rendered plastic in sound is undoubtedly fitting.",

From this point of view—and this dynamic is palpable in the cited letter—Steuermann clearly focuses more on the detail than on the whole. Alongside the spontaneity and “drasticity” in expression attributed to him by Adorno, this analytical attention to the particular seems eventually to have given rise to an uncertainty with regard to success of pianistic shaping, addressed straightforwardly by Adorno as “considerable inhibition”: “His ideal of interpretation had as its horizon the dawning uninterpretability of the works, just as Kafka’s parables are inspired by the obscurity of sacred texts” ( Adorno [1964] 1982 , 313–15).

But on the other hand, in contrast to the abrupt and often extreme tempi in Kraus 1960 and Gould 1965, Steuermann always aims at a balance.

(This intention of presenting Schoenberg’s revolutionary compositions as “normal music” may easily be explained by the Second Viennese School’s struggle for institutional and music-historical recognition, but it certainly implies a tendency towards a normalization of musical interpretation, which arguably does not do justice to this school’s outstanding works.)",
