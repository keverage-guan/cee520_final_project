Also, Allen Forte obtained remarkably interesting results some twenty-plus years ago with his R0, R1, R2, and Rp relationships ( The Structure of Atonal Music , Yale University Press, 1973).  Those relationships have been much maligned in the subsequent similarity literature. I think a more sympathetic re-evaluation, especially of Forte’s analytical applications, could prove very illuminating.",

Competing clusters,\nbased on different pivots or on different cutoff points relative\nto a single pivot, could thus presumably be evaluated according\nto how well they conformed to perception.  (Recall that\nevaluation in general, and not perception in particular, was the\nfocus of the essay.)  But there are many basic difficulties here.\nOne lies in identifying precisely what percepts might be\nappropriate testing grounds for the evaluation.  (Cf. paragraph\n16 in the essay.)  Another is that of isolating the “similarity”\nrelationship component from other factors contributing to a goal\npercept.  (Cf. paragraph 17 in the essay.)",

However valid\nthat assumption may or may not be, the two problems mentioned\nabove remain even for functions more securely grounded in that\narea.  If I understand Professor Parncutt’s paragraph 6\ncorrectly, he is suggesting a table lookup function (?), where\nthe table entries have been determined empirically through\nexperimentation.  I suppose that this means asking subjects to\nrate “global similarity” for 29 x 29 = 841 pairs of chords (or\n841 x 2 = 1682, to check for immediate order effects).  Perhaps\nthe chords would be sounds, extracted from a single performance—maybe normalized somehow, maybe not.  It might even be\npossible (maybe!) to explain what “global similarity” means, so\nthat subjects would have some idea of what to shoot for.",

Given competing clusters of the 29 chords under the\nproposed function, our hope would be to select only good clusters\nby listening to the piano ostinato.  What to test against is the\nfirst decision: smooth progressions, surface grouping boundaries,\nshifts in large-scale harmonic region?  Whatever we decide will\nlikely require considerable extrapolation in order to relate it\nto the exhaustive process of discrete chord pairings used in\nderiving the function; each step in the extrapolation increases\nthe distance between the function’s application and its\nperceptual grounding.  Next, given a goal percept, would we\nnecessarily reject a clustering because it conflicts with the\npercept?  Other factors not addressed through the experimental\nbinary comparisons could take control in such situations—contour changes; local tessitura; rhythm; clarinet, violin, and\ncello parts; voice leading.  (Recent mto-list exchanges on\nenharmonicism seem especially relevant to me here.)  The problem\nis in determining how far mitigating factors are operative, and\nhow far they should be taken into account, when judging\nsimilarity-based boundaries according to perception.",

So,\nwhat I suggest instead is that we recognize “context-free\nsimilarity” for the oxymoron that it is.  (On a volunteer basis,\nof course.)  Similarity presupposes a context.  The context of REL\nis a particular intellectual apparatus.  The context of (what I\nunderstand to be) Professor Parncutt’s proposed similarity\nmeasure is a particular experimental setting.  I would not at all\nsuggest abandoning “similarity” functions.  Like all reasonably\nwell-developed constructs, they hold nice potential for\ntheorists. (1) What I do suggest is applying more energy toward\nunderstanding their limits. (2)",
