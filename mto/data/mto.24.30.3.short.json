    "abstract": "A thorough understanding of how music and movement synthesize is vital for deeper exploration of multimedia artworks. In this article, I demonstrate a choreomusical analytic technique that links detailed analyses of both music and choreography from the balletFancy Free, a work that was the product of a close collaboration between Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins. Specifically, I explore the three sailors’ solo variations, noting placement and repetition of rhythmic and choreographic phrases, elisions and metric changes, and reinterpretation of rhythmic patterns. I observe differences in grouping and accents to reveal how the changing relationships between dance and music create unique characterizations for each of the sailors. My integrated reading of music and original choreography explores the relationship between music and movement, offering a way to understand how they intertwine.",

Cook 1998 uses ballet as an example of interaction between two separate elements, music and dance, “and the aesthetic effect of ballet emerges from the interaction between the two.” In addition, McMains and Thomas ( 2013 ) explain how related arts can act in amplification of each other. As an example of past scholarship, music theorists have written at length on rhythmic matters in the first few measures of the Rite of Spring ; however, they often overlook potential insights provided by broadening the analyses to choreographic aspects of the ballet (see McDonald 2010 , van den Toorn 1987 , and Pasler 1986 ). As Pasler describes, the creators of the Rite all worked together in a collaborative process to create a total artwork. While the ballet aspect was disowned by Stravinsky for a time, it was initially written for ballet, as a collaboration between the arts, or synchronization between the senses.",

As contemporary dance critic Denby observed ( 1986 , 62), even strong music and dance correspondences are not exact equivalences. Denby expanded on how correlations between dance and music are viewed by some choreographers: “The rhythmic interest in ballet dancing isn’t fixed on the beat or on the dancers’ relation to it; the interest is in their relation to the musical phrase, to the melody, to the musical period . . . you follow the rhythm not by separate steps but by the rise and fall of extended phrases” (quoted in Gottlieb 2008 , 388–89). While I agree with Denby that patterns of steps can clearly be chained together, I also appreciate the collective power of smaller accents on individual movements. In my view, the imprecision noted by Denby is due to the differing nature of musical and dance accents, which one must consider when exploring their intersections. Dance accents can also be affected by the unique timbres of different steps (see Short 2023 ).",

Regarding music, Lester ( 1986 , 15) argues that “an accent is a point of emphasis” or “initiation,” and he sees musical accents as marked points in time, a conception that must be extended when broadened to dance accents. Following Cooper & Meyer ( 1960 , 8), London ( 2012 , 19) asks a similar question, “What then is a metrical accent?” arguing that it is related to our metrical entrainment and attending: “an event that is marked by consciousness.” See also Schachter 1998 on metrical accents without duration. The notion of “units” of time has also been problematized—see the discussion of beat as a point in time, or as a more circular, processual feel, in Hasty 1997 and 1999 , London 1999 , and Horlacher 2011 . As Jordan ( 1996 , 19) notes regarding dance, “We perceive time in dance as divided into units (events) that begin with an impulse or onset of stillness, regardless of the beginning of a movement.” Jordan’s ( 2021 , 5) discussion of the problematic differences for ballet dancers and musicians regarding terminology of “counts” and “beats” also points to longer phrases as a key link between the two disciplines: “dance counts (which are often marked in dance scores alongside bar lines and musical time signatures) often span multiple notated measures (e.g., four dance counts might cover a four-bar span).” Simpson-Litke and Stover 2019 discuss the analytical challenges of notating dance movements, particularly mentioning the “subtle but significant differences in the timing of steps versus weight shifts” that dancers acknowledge. They explain further: “While it is true that the directional ramifications of the breaks are not seen in the steps right away, these changes of direction are felt more immediately in the body than is suggested by these comparatively static footwork diagrams” ( Simpson-Litke and Stover 2019 , 80). They also summarize various perspectives on this, especially in regards to salsa partner dancing. Analytical terms vary: Abrahams’s ( 2020 , 51) exploration of movement through mimicry uses terminology including the “ictus” (the outermost point of a movement) combined with the “locus” (the internal originating body point of a movement), which together create the movement “trajectory”; see, in particular, Fig. 4.",

Although there are numerous biographical accounts of Bernstein and Robbins, few scholars have focused on how their creative activities intersect. In my analysis, I consider music and dance structures both on their own and aligned together to see how they inform each other. The musical framework focuses on rhythm and meter, paying close attention to musical accents, phrase lengths, perceived and notated time signature changes, and larger formal sections. The dance framework examines the original choreography, noting how dance accents correlate with rhythmic accents and changes in meter, and looks at larger sequences of steps, which I term “choreographic phrases.” Combining the two frameworks, I explore correspondences and conflicts in grouping, hypermeter, and accents. This approach proves particularly fruitful when studying the variations in Fancy Free ’s sixth movement; it furnishes insight into the characters of the three sailors who are the work’s protagonists. I show how combined creative choices in the music and choreography distinguish each sailor’s unique personality. 1. Theoretical Context: Choreomusical Analysis with a Rhythm & Meter Focus",

A focus on the experience of someone listening to the music without considering the visual or physical input can leave an analyst with only a partial picture. Incorporating the visual movement element adds a rich perspective to the separate experience of listening to music alone, especially with music created to be danced to and encountered in tandem with a staged performance. (1) Conceiving of ballet music as intended specifically for dance is important because choreography can influence an audience member’s perception of the meter. The analyses in this article proceed by exploring how the music sounds, then comparing notated with heard meter, and then adding the choreographic layer. While each individual observer will necessarily engage with music and dance differently, some generalizations are possible.

Some of the problematic issues faced early on by interdisciplinary scholars combining the fields of dance research and musicology/music theory are discussed by Jordan ( 2011 ). (4) Authors have tended to look more at critical theory, performance studies, or historical musicology instead of analyses that explore music-theoretical concerns. (5) Scholars with backgrounds in dance often use methodologies that tend towards broad categorization or description in lieu of detailed musical analyses. (6) More recently, scholars have devised new tools based on known analytical methods to explore dance, (7) and recent scholars have explored various ways to notate dance and music. (8) For example, Leaman’s ( 2021a , 2021b , 2022 ) choreomusical scores visualize dance and musical elements together, showing vertical placement of the dancers’ bodies as they occur in time to explore the musical artistry of a specific choreographer. (9) Simpson-Litke’s ( 2021 ) choreographic salsa scores combine detailed footwork patterns with musical transcriptions, exploring how improvising dancers attend to various musical features.

Cox’s ( 2011 , 2016 ) explorations of the mimetic hypothesis offer a way of theorizing our embodied experiences of music, which has particular implications for analyzing meter. London ( 2012 ), van den Toorn ( 1987 ), and Gjerdingen ( 1989 ) see meter as “a mode of attending.” (13) To enhance that view, I would fold in the visual modality: I argue that watching dance can affect an attending strategy, as rhythmic movement can help to encourage a particular metric interpretation. (14) Visualizing the additional accents and groupings created by a dancer’s movements affords an observer more to attend to; this information may reinforce or obscure insights gained from a solely musical perspective. Even for an audience member sitting and watching a performance, motor aspects—the bodily activity of the dancers on stage—may influence the metric entrainment of the observer. (15)",

Just as metrically conflicting passages in music necessitate greater attention and can therefore elicit more excitement from audience members, sections where dance and music are in opposition can generate energy and momentum. (17) These frictions between music and choreography often produce dramatic effects; in the wake of exertion-filled sections, sudden correspondences between music and dance can then establish a combined climax or structural downbeat.

                "text": "[1.6] Dance critics and analysts have long been fascinated with how choreographic accents and phrases correlate with musical accents. (19) Unlike their musical equivalents, dance accents can be points of emphasis that do not necessarily coincide with a step’s onset or duration; often accents occur at the apex of a jump or turn, the outermost point of a kick, or the lowest point of a bend ( plié ). (20) As well as accents created by visual movement, dance accents can also include moments of movement cessation, such as a held pose or a break in the dancing, and accents that create sound by physical means. (21) I define “body percussion” as choreographed movement that includes intentional and meaningful production of sound, such as claps, snaps, or hands slapping against thighs. (22) I call larger sequences of linked steps “choreographic phrases.” While individual creators’ styles vary, the boundaries of choreographic phrases are marked by salient elements including repetition and parallelism, directional shifts, and conventional step expectations within a genre. The delineation of choreographic phrase boundaries is a helpful aid for those seeking to understand choreographic structures, especially in cases when the perceived beginning of individual steps is not clear. While an observer’s metrical attending can affect their perception of dance accents, conversely, accents and phrases in choreography can affect one’s metric understanding. Dance accents can help to clarify aspects of a musical passage that are, as London would define, metrically ambiguous, or those with disrupted entrainment possibilities. (23) Leonard Bernstein’s music, as will be shown below, offers an unusual wealth of entrainment possibilities that can be confirmed or thwarted by choreography. 2.

(29) In his discussions of highly syncopated American music, Bernstein stressed the importance of an underlying beat. (30) Bernstein’s own music frequently exhibits motivic repetition over a constant pulse, an arrangement particularly suited for playing with listener expectations. In the narrative ballet Fancy Free , this rhythmic play in the music combines with the onstage action to tell the story and to establish and develop its characters. (31)",

The first group of three horn blasts begins on beat one of m. 534 and spans one and a half measures, which equals “1+2” on the next hypermetric level up; the galop motive then confirms this hypermetric understanding. Four bars later (m. 537), two similar horn bleats begin on beat two, or the “+” of the next hypermetric level. This may confuse a listener who expects an accented attack on “1+2” as before, because this time the attacks begin on the “+.” The last three horn blasts may be heard either as an anacrusis on “+1+,” or as 1+2, like the beginning.

A brief plié prepares him for a high jump with multiple turns in the air ( tour en l’air ), until he lands in the splits to correspond with the orchestral hits that begin the music. Sailor One’s plié preparation for more pirouettes happens on the notated downbeat of m. 538; while this movement could confirm a downbeat there, its occurrence with the second of two orchestral hits may further confound the listener. Sailor One completes the pirouettes with his legs apart to highlight the musical accents over the barline (mm. 540–41), clasping his hands above his head to pump them twice high in the air in a “victory” gesture (V!).

Initially, the choreography for the first phase (the repeat of mm. 542–45, shown with a dotted orange slur) has a downward preparation ( plié ) on the anacrusis (d) and a kick up (U) on the downbeat (upper-case letters denote downbeat placement); during the second choreographic sequence, the lowering plié happens directly on the downbeat (D) with the kick on the second beat (u).

In this setting, Robbins brings his distinct “American” perspective to it. The sailor starts by traveling clockwise with traditional energetic leaping and turning steps (known as sauté and coupé , respectively). To complete the traditional sequence, a straight-leg split leap (or grand jeté ) is expected next (the entire sequence is known as jetés en manège or coupé jeté en tournant ). Instead of the traditional straight-leg split leap, Robbins has the dancer bend both legs and bring them in front, slapping his knees with his hands while turning in the air. This modified leap is closer to a barrel roll—a colloquial musical theatre step—than the classical grand jeté . The body percussion of hands slapping thighs also is different from a traditional manège , where the only sounds would be those of the dancer’s feet as they land on the floor (though note: professional ballet dancers often attempt to minimize these sounds).

A three-note chromatic motive is repeated three times during the phrase’s initial ascent and only twice on its initial descent, which creates uneven hypermetric phrases of four and three bars.

For spectators, the choreographed dance steps during the cocky variation alternately aid and complicate their navigation of the music’s metric confusions.

This portrayal is achieved through a combination of gracefully curving, elegant steps along with sweet and fluid music. Entitled “Waltz” by Bernstein, the majority of the variation has a waltz feel, despite the relative rarity of music notated in steady 4 3 meter. (41) In the outer sections of the movement’s ternary form, Bernstein links together bits of waltz-like motives; the music, first featuring woodwinds and violins, is then gently expanded through the addition of more instruments, larger ranges, developing motives, and increasing metric confusion. The choreography alternately confirms and contradicts the waltz topic, serving as a playful reinterpretation of rhythmic patterns in the dance steps that fits with the sailor’s romantic and jocund character. Even in the middle 4 4 section, the dance steps confirm the metrical displacement, as both music and choreography work together. In one particular passage, the same musical phrase is set with two different sequences of steps, leading to a different metrical understanding the second time through the phrase. The light-hearted character comes through in the various ways the dancer moves to the repeating musical motives. Example 13 . John Kriza (Sailor Two): “kind of dreamy and sweet” (click to enlarge)",

These rhythmic effects help to create motivic development, so that this seemingly simple and repetitive piece is full of development and change. Example 14 provides a formal summary of musical motives, rhythmic effects, and the larger ternary form of A–B–(transition)–A. Bernstein develops familiar motives in various ways: adding and changing instruments, inserting smaller motives to enlarge familiar motive chains, and combining neighboring motive pairs into novel sequences. (42) The nominal tonal center of G major is constantly in flux. Clear-cut cadences are limited, as most sections transform and transition into succeeding ones with elided melodic phrases. Tension builds to a central apex, then releases going into the final section. While all three variations are in tripartite form, with both the second and third in rough ABA form that musically trails off at the end, the sizable transition section between the B and final A sections in the second variation is distinct in the way it layers and interjects echoes of familiar motives. Due to these echoes, the delineation between sectional breaks during the musical transition is somewhat blurry, allowing the choreography to provide section-parsing clues.",

As I indicate with blue slurs, the repeated “waltz” motives are heard in roughly three-beat groups, although some overlap the notated barlines. The slur line over the 8 3 and 4 4 measures illustrates a clipped rhythm, as the expected three-beat grouping is cut slightly short to 2.5 beats long. Blue brackets show larger motivic groups often supported by bass-line repetition, and numbers contained in each bracket show the quarter-note beats from each smaller motivic group.

The easygoing and romantic waltz topic, while often clipped musically, is “felt” in the music and confirmed by the choreography as the dancer’s moves smooth over the shifts of the notated meter. (48) Taken together, the unbroken chain of rolling turns and mellifluous steps that supplely merge one onto the other interlace with the almost “waltz” meter in the music to create the sweet and playful characterization of the second sailor. 5.

This solo number exhibits the strongest corroboration between music and steps in the three variations—the choreography accents the Latin-inspired rhythms in the music, and together they project a compelling and confident character. Sailor Three was originally danced by Robbins himself and he can be seen doing so in archival footage at the New York Public Library. Example 17 shows poses from a signature, hip-accentuating move ( Fehl 1944c and 1944d ). This “Danzon” was an initial foray into the Latin rhythms for which both Bernstein and Robbins would become very well known, most notably in the next decade when adapted to great success in the musical West Side Story . (49) The third variation has an important place in the ballet, as it is the last of the three solos and leads to the ballet’s climatic ending. It excels in its own way, in part because of the seamless way the music and the choreography work together. Example 18 . Bernstein, “rhumba with a small r” (click to enlarge)",

The few extended six-bar phrases and the three measures of 4 2 notably stand out against the local backdrop of symmetry. Within the boundaries of this regularity, Bernstein adds unique rhythmic elements to characterize the smooth third sailor. These include developing contrasting rhythms within the straightforward metric framework, providing musical space by incorporating rests, and using un-pitched rhythmic percussion. The most common of the rhythmic complexities is a pattern of eighth notes in groups of 3-3-2, a jazzy rhythm Bernstein termed “rhumba with a small r”; this is shown in Example 18 . (50) Example 19 .

These include what I call the “seven” motive, because of its elided seven half-note beats; rhythmic ostinatos a and d ; and the melodic themes a (ascending melodic arc), b (descending melodic arc), c (octave leaps and descending triplets), d (squarely in 4 4 in a new key), and e (developed from the descending triplets). Looking at the overall form illuminates the abundance of four-bar phrases with two-bar hypermeter. The only stand-alone two-bar phrases are linking sections: the transition at m. 753 and ostinato a fragments (mm. 774 and 814). The two six-bar phrases are also linking passages. The first longer phrase (mm. 804–9) layers ostinato a under melody e , providing a transition between two large sections. The last six-bar phrase is an extended echo of melody a to transition into a dwindling percussion section. Example 20 .

This type of syncopated rhythmic pattern—often accompanied with an initial focus on beats one and four—underlies much of the variation. Example 21 shows how the rhythmic feel varies in the different larger sections. The first part of the example, Rhythm Group A, encapsulates the main rhythms in the outer A sections. The common 3-3-2 rumba division often causes a syncopated accent on the “+” of beat two (shown underlined). Later variants in the snare drum and bass drum (S.D./B.D.) also accent similar rhythms. Bernstein uses contrasting, less syncopated rhythms to underlie the middle B section, accompanied with a strong change in orchestration. (51) Shown as Rhythmic Group B, the core ostinato places strong, square accents on beats one and three, while the second and fourth beats are evenly divided ( 1 2+ 3 4+). In the transition to the final A section, rhythmic groups A & B are layered simultaneously.

The first few notes of Example 22 show this sequence of quarter notes and rests and the choreography that corresponds with them. The onset of the first musical accent is accompanied with a choreographic accent; the sailor’s legs and arms sharply slide wide apart with palms facing to the back. His feet then go together for a preparatory knee bend ( plié ); then the legs again accent “out” while his arms reach up high above his head. The musical space of quarter rests in the second measure is accented with postured claps (a body percussion reminiscent of some Flamenco dances). The wavy eighth-note melodic motion in m. 739 is complemented by an undulating physical motion: the sailor’s feet are stationary as his bent knees swerve from one side to the other.",

For the quarter-note rest in the music, the sailor brings one arm over his head to clap his other hand, which is held fixed. His body and face have turned away from the audience, while the moving leg is bent behind his body. The loud clap and highly raised leg sharply accent the space provided by the musical rest. After the clap, he brings his raised foot down to the floor, and the eighth-note rest on the next beat is filled with more body percussion: a bursting finger snap that initiates “jazz hands” exploding to the sky. Coming directly after the 4 2 elision, the choreographic accent on the downbeat helps the audience reorient to the returning 4 4 meter. The choreography complements many of the musical accents occurring on beats one and four, and the musical bass line is accentuated by the spatial “up/down” body movements.",

This pose is seemingly motionless, yet holds the latent power of imminent, expected movement. As musical rests can provide space for dance, here, dance, in return, allows space for music. The clip of this excerpt allows one to see how the choreography matches the notes and rests, the music and dance entwining and giving each other space as together they create a unique portrayal of the sailors’ confident leader.

The two flutes’ sinuous melody evokes swiveling hips from the sailor ( Example 23 ). The dancer’s movements create accents with left and right hip swivels (L, R) that match the syncopated accents in the clarinet and bassoon pitches, and subsequent suspensions of movement match the musical rests. In the first phrase, swivels to the L - R, L, R! are followed by three beats of movement cessation (!). The second phrase begins the same way, but the pausing rest begins earlier with a full beat of choreographic holds: the movements occur on beats 1-34 1--- |1-34 ----| (the video portion of Example 23 includes both examples shown in this section; the beginning “seven motive”; the 4 2 measure; and the choreographic space during the swivels). The four-beat pause (!!) is full of character as the sailor looks towards the women at the table enticingly. During all the swivels he keeps his arm position steady from the prior pose, with wrists slightly bent in front of his chest. This keeps the focus on the isolated body parts—his swaying hips. Choreographic rhythms are less syncopated in the third and fourth phrases, but still occur with svelte and slinky steps. Example 24 . Mvt.

Instead of big leaps or traveling around the stage as in a typical finale section, the ending choreography highlights isolated and controlled movements. As seen in Example 24 , the body percussion leads to the climax to emphasize the coolly confident character of the third sailor. He taps on stools with alternating hands, then sits on a barstool (on the downbeat) to tap on the bar with his upstage hand. He next climbs up on the stool and slaps his thighs. The second foot joins on the stool so he can stand up on top; with head lifted slightly back, he pounds proudly on his chest. For the climax, he leaps high off the barstool, clapping in mid-air before he lands on the ground for his final pose on one knee. Example 25 . Jerome Robbins in Fancy Free (click to enlarge)",

The individual characterizations in the variations, emerging directly out of the matchless way the dance and music work together, likely helped make Fancy Free the hit that it became. Reviews from the initial production indicate that the three solos were the highlight of the entire ballet. New York Times critic John Martin described the variations this way: The kids who dance it dance it like mad. Robbins has devised a solo for Harold Lang in which he is called upon to do everything but climb the asbestos curtain. At this point some of us wiseacres began to shake our heads. This was only the first of three solos, and it seemed impossible for the other two boys to do anything that would not look sick by comparison. But Robbins knew what he was about. For John Kriza and himself he designed dances that leaned not on technical stunts but made their points on characterization and individuality of style. ( Martin 1944a )",

It is not only through correspondence of music and dance, but also by conflict and counterpoint between them, that the characterizations emerge. These nuanced observations are made possible by taking each art form as a subject for detailed investigation—both independently and together. Choreomusical analysis provides a lens through which we can explore the essential and expressive relationship between music and dance and is essential for a thorough understanding of entrainment of movement designed for specific music. While particularly appropriate to the metric dissonance in Bernstein’s musical language, (53) this approach has further applications outside of ballet: film music and staged operas, music videos and TikTok choreography, and synchronized rhythmically flashing lights at a concert (see Lucas 2021 ). Other musical experiences merge auditory events with visual movement that is not carefully crafted and prescribed, and modified analytical methods can help explore those situations. Our bodies are involved in encountering music, particularly as we experience rhythm and meter, and multifaceted analyses can help us understand how.",
