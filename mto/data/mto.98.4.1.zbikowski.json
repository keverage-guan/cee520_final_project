    "abstract": "A recent discussion on the smt-list focused on Nicholas Cook’s claim inMusic, Imagination, and Culturethat musical analysis is essentially metaphorical. This essay investigates this claim through a review of recent work on metaphor by cognitive scientists. This work both supports and modifies Cook’s original claim. The latter portion of the essay presents examples of two applications of research on metaphor to music theory.",

I have used Oster’s 1979 translation for similar reasons,\nand also because it invokes a debate about translation that may be\nprofitably viewed through the lens of cross-domain mapping.

Most of us find descent—especially scalar descent—well\nrepresented by the thought of walking down a staircase, but I think it\ncould be argued that walking down a hillside works as well.  The reason is\nthat it isn’t so much the neat, two-dimensional image of stairs that is\noperative but the regular transfer of weight from one leg to another.\nIndirect evidence is provided by a striking anecdote related by John\nHockenberry, from a time when he was a reporter for National Public Radio.\nIn order to get to a group of Kurdish refugees on a remote edge of Iraqi\nKurdistan during the aftermath of the Gulf War, Hockenberry, a paraplegic\nsince 1976, had to temporarily abandon his wheelchair and get a ride on a\ndonkey.  He comments on the effect of becoming reacquainted with a\nnon-wheeled mode of transportation through the rhythm of the donkey’s gait:\n“It was walking, that feeling of groping and climbing and floating on\nstilts that I had not felt for fifteen years.  I had long ago grown to love\nmy own wheels and their special physical grace, and so this clumsy leg walk\nwas not something I missed until the sensation came rushing back through my\nbody from the shoulders of a donkey.”  John Hockenberry, Moving\nViolations: War Zones, Wheelchairs, and Declarations of Independence (New\nYork: Hyperion, 1995), 2–3. 25.

                "text": "[2.1] As Cook notes, the perspective on musical analysis he presents \nin Music, Imagination, and Culture is informed by the work of the \nphilosopher Roger Scruton.  Scruton directly addresses the metaphoricity \nof our accounts of music in his 1983 essay “Understanding Music.”  \nScruton’s argument centers on a crucial distinction between sound and \nmusic.  Sound, from his perspective, is a material fact, and as such is \na matter for scientific understanding.  Music, in contrast, is an \nintentional construct, a matter of the concepts through which we \nperceive the world.  The evidence for this distinction is provided by \nthe metaphorical nature of our characterizations of music: although we\nspeak of ‘musical space’ (and locate tones within it), this space does\nnot correspond, in a rational way, to physical space; although we\nspeak of ‘musical motion,’ the motion is at best apparent, and not\nreal.  The concepts of space and motion are extended to music through\nmetaphorical transference as a way to account for certain aspects of\nour experience of music.  These metaphors are not an addition to\nmusical understanding, but are in fact basic to it.  Scruton writes, . . . in our most basic apprehension of music there lies a\n    complex system of metaphor, which is the true description of\n    no material fact.  And the metaphor cannot be eliminated\n    from the description of music, because it is integral to the\n    intentional object of musical experience.  Take this\n    metaphor away and you take away the experience of music. (2) What Scruton sees as the unyielding metaphoricity of musical\nunderstanding points to the intentional nature of music, and leads him\nto assert that “Music belongs uniquely to the intentional sphere, and\nnot to the material realm.  Any analysis of music must be an exercise\nin intentional rather than scientific understanding.” (3)",

Speaking of\nSchenkerian analysis in the introduction, Cook writes, “A Schenkerian\nanalysis is not a scientific explanation, but a metaphorical one; it\nis not an account of how people actually hear pieces of music, but a\nway of imagining them.” (4) Cook also extends Scruton’s argument by\novertly linking the way we imagine music to the ontology of musical\ncultures: “ . . . a musical culture is, in essence, a repertoire of\nmeans for imagining music; it is the specific pattern of divergences\nbetween the experience of music on the one hand, and the images by\nmeans of which it is represented on the other, that gives a musical\nculture its identity.” (5) In consequence, the metaphoricity of musical\nunderstanding is not only inescapable, but is in fact connected with\nthe establishment of musical cultures.",

For instance, the conceptual metaphor STATE OF BEING IS\nORIENTATION IN VERTICAL SPACE maps relationships in physical space onto\nmental and physical states.

Others are highly\npoetic, as demonstrated by the opening of Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale”: My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk. Here the descent to the mythical river gives a physical correlate to the\nnarcotic state of the narrator—the act of sinking is mapped onto a\nmelancholy emotional state—and serves as yet another expression of the\nconceptual metaphor STATE OF BEING IS ORIENTATION IN VERTICAL SPACE.

Mapping various fruits onto musical\npitches works less well because fruit do not (in any ordinary way)\nconstitute a continuum.

The tension inherent in\nliving beings is not the same thing as a span across physical space.\nAlthough we might speak of such a span as being “under tension,” this\ntension can be correlated with life-force only through metaphor.  It must\nalso be noted that Schenker’s theory of music is in no way deficient in its\nreliance on a number of conceptual metaphors, for the metaphors serve\ndifferent purposes.  The image evoked by the use of Spannung in the first\npassage comes from a perspective that views music as highly charged and essentially dynamic. This perspective, engaged and at times passionate,\nis one of the things that makes Schenker a compelling writer.  The image\nevoked by the use of Spannung in the second passage comes from a\nperspective that views music as a made object consisting of components and\nrelations.  This perspective is a more familiar, “music-theoretical” one,\nwell suited to the deliberate contemplation of musical relations conducive\nto systematic theorizing and to pedagogy.",

In one recent article Janna Saslaw\noffers a detailed analysis of the modulation theory of Hugo Riemann in\nlight of current research into metaphor; Saslaw also provides an invaluable\nsummary of image-schema theory. (21) In another article, Saslaw discusses\nmetaphorical manifestations of force schemata in the theories of Schenker\nand Arnold Schoenberg. (22) And in a forthcoming essay, I explore the way\ntwo models of hierarchy are mapped onto music, and how these mappings\nconstrain our inferences about musical organization. (23) The discussions\nof the role of metaphor in structuring our music-theoretical thought that\nare undertaken in these three essays elaborate many points that are only\nglossed here. Example 2 .

                "text": "[5.6] Research into metaphor can also be used to explain more immediate,\nless overtly theoretical ways that we understand music.  As an example, let\nus consider a bit of text painting from the Credo of Giovanni da\nPalestrina’s Pope Marcellus Mass ; the music is given in Example 2 .  As\ncan be seen, with the first occurrence of the word “descendit,” each voice\nbegins a scalar descent.  The commonplace answer to why this text painting\nworks is that the descent evoked by the text correlates with the descent\nthrough musical space. However, as I showed above, there is no necessity to\nthis correlation: “descendit” also correlates with an increase in\nheaviness, an increase in the size of the notes, and the growing age of\neach note.  Which two domains are correlated depends only on the conceptual\nmetaphor used to structure pitch relations.  A fall-back answer is that the\ncorrelation between physical space and musical pitch is simply stylized:\nalthough there is no necessity to it, it has been done so often that we\nreadily accept the mapping.  A somewhat more interesting answer is that the\nphysical sensations associated with descent are well represented by a\nseries of pitches produced by successively less-rapid vibrations of the\nsounding medium.  The descent of our bodies through physical space (unaided\nby artificial means) involves a lessening of kinetic energy and a\ncontinuous action in one direction, articulated by the regular transfer of\nweight from one leg to another. (24) The DESCENT image schema will include\nthese sensations, as well as a motion downward in physical space.  The act\nof singing a descending scale correlates well with the basic structure of\nthis image schema: the relaxation many singers feel as they sing a\ndescending scale matches the lessening of kinetic energy; the temporary\npauses on each note of the scale match the regular transfer of weight which\narticulates a physical descent.  The text painting of “descéndit” is thus\nsupported by our embodied knowledge of descent.  Although the text painting\nis not necessary, it seems so intuitively right that it is only with a\nstruggle that we can imagine the alternatives.",

Jackendoff proposed that music is represented cognitively\nthrough a level of mental representation he called bodily representation ,\n“essentially a body-specific encoding of the internal sense of the states\nof the muscles, limbs, and joints.” (25) However, because Jackendoff took\nthe position that musical knowledge was non-conceptual, there is no\nexplicit link between bodily representation and conceptual representation.\nThere is, however, such a link between image schemata and concepts.\nImage-schema theory may also provide a way to address the oft-noted\nemotional aspect of music by building on Zoltán Kövecses’s work on\nemotion concepts, which Kövecses has argued are based on conceptual\nmetaphors.

(27) Gibbs’s analysis\nof metonymy gives a way to approach systematically the practice of musical\nallusion, especially where this allusion is used to invoke the function as well as the affect of the larger section of music recalled through the\nallusion.  Other researchers have recently proposed expanding the\nconventional two-domain model of cross-domain mapping to four (or more)\ndomains as a way of more completely accounting for the blending and\nintegration of concepts.
