Although I hint above that some of the chapters in the book could have been placed in a different order, the fact is that many of the fingerprints are so intertwined that many different orderings are possible. It seems that Wollenberg has gone for a design where the fingerprints are chiefly discussed in the order in which they are most likely to appear in a musical form, starting with the major–minor mixture at the beginning of works (Chapter 1) to the heavenly length of Schubert’s finales (Chapter 9).",
