    "abstract": "The music of Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah is known for combining a rigid44-based hypermetrical song structure with riffs having a variety of durational spans. These looping riffs fall in and out of alignment with this background structure, but rarely overcome it, as their cycling is cut off at the end of the hypermetrical segment. Some riffs, however, further complicate this structure by seeming to beginin media res. This article studies three such riffs from the 2008 albumobZenas a way of analyzing the larger juxtaposition of rigidly regular quadruple hypermetrical song segments with riffs that struggle—and usually fail—to destabilize those structures. In my analyses, I move between conventional transcriptions and spectrograms, with an eye (and ear) toward questioning what each can tell us about musical events. Finally, with lyrics often centered on the desire for radical freedom or enlightenment, and musical patterns that ritualize the suppression of elements that break the “order” of44, I suggest that Meshuggah’s use of rhythm and form explores ideas of freedom and rigid control, liveliness and predictability, with which listeners engage via a variety of embodied listening practices.",

            "text": "1. As is typical of extreme metal performance practice, Meshuggah’s live performances tend to faithfully reproduce their recordings. Occasional discrepancies do emerge, however, and I discuss some of these later. Meshuggah’s members have repeatedly demonstrated themselves capable of performing their music with near-mechanical accuracy in live settings, and they have furthermore admitted that achieving this level of performance requires a great deal of practice. Due to the difficulty of performing their music live, songs for a tour’s setlist are decided well in advance to allow for sufficient rehearsal time; for example, “Bleed” ( obZen ) allegedly took drummer Tomas Haake over six months of practice to be able to play through continuously ( Weiss 2010 ). The band has also admitted that there are some songs that will likely never receive a live performance—songs like “The Demon’s Name is Surveillance” (from 2012’s Koloss )—as they have not been able to get to a point where they can perform them without physical discomfort ( Previ 2013 ). Similarly, they say they will never perform the twenty-minute single-track EP I (2004), with Haake describing the song’s form as “random” and saying “no one [in the band] knows how I goes” ( McFarland 2010 ). (For an analysis of portions of I , see Pieslak 2007 , 223–42.) Technology plays a significant role in Meshuggah’s compositional process, as programming has replaced the demo in their songwriting process. The challenge, then, is that they can program anything, but they “need to be able to play it as well”; Haake adds that the temptation in programming is for the mind to outstrip the body’s ability, and that he resists this temptation by trying to “feel” his way through the programming process ( Wincent Drumsticks AB 2015 ). While tempo is usually dealt with during recording, they have occasionally shown flexibility with regard to performance tempi. Live performances of the title song “obZen,” for example, are slower than the recorded version by about 10 bpm, allowing the song’s groove to “breathe” a bit more. Most recently, they have placed a renewed emphasis on live performance in their recording process, as the 2016 album The Violent Sleep of Reason was recorded live. This process enabled them to avoid the issues of tempo and playability that arose when learning material from obZen and Koloss for touring purposes, and in Haake’s opinion resulted in a more “honest” sound ( O’Neill 2016 ). Music technology has pushed Meshuggah toward discovering their limits as human performers. Nevertheless, they remain committed to producing songs that by and large work in a live setting. That they give an impression of “sonic machines” during performances has not only to do with the role they allow technology to play in their compositional process, but also the meticulously synced lightshow, the lack of banter or excessive movement on stage, and Kidman’s robotic and deliberately “monotonous” vocals, which together form the band’s carefully cultivated performance style ( Radio Fortuna 2008 ).",

            "text": "5. In their 2012 album Koloss , the band begins to weaken the edges of this 4 4 based hyperstructure, allowing riffs to spill over the edges of their song segments, and playing with the looping of riffs within each song segment, modifying them to create subtle motivic variations. See, for example, the songs “Do Not Look Down” (0:00–1:48; analyzed in Capuzzo 2014 and 2018 ), “Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion” (0:27–1:23), and “Swarm” (0:52–1:36).",

            "text": "6. Meshuggah sometimes uses a technique in which the last repetition of a riff within a given segment is altered and rhythmically shortened or lengthened to bring it back into alignment with the hypermetrical structure. See, for example, Pieslak’s 2007 analysis of “Rational Gaze” (222). Pieslak does not make a distinction between riffs that are altered to bring them into alignment and those that are cut off mid-stride; for him, all riffs end with an altered version, even if the alteration is only a truncation of the original. Capuzzo ( 2018 ) refers to these lengthened, truncated, or altered final repetitions as “tails”; he also does not distinguish between alteration of the pattern itself and cutting it off before it’s finished (123). For Capuzzo, a riff with no tail is one which is not cut off and therefore runs over the boundaries of the song segment ( 2018 , 132). The examples presented here happen to exclusively feature riffs that are cut off mid-stride at the end of the song segment. Since my analyses here are largely concerned with felt qualities of “beginning” and “ending,” I feel that this distinction between a rhythmic pattern that is cut short versus one in which the internal pitches and/or rhythms are altered so as to re-align with the hypermetrical structure is important and deserves additional future research in its own right.",

            "text": "8. One question that arises frequently is how the band members themselves understand rhythm in their music. Historically, they have been reluctant to discuss the use of rhythm and meter in their music in detail. (Of the five current members, only the bassist (Dick Lövgren) is formally trained in music, having studied jazz at the University of Gothenburg.) When asked, they tend to state simply that everything is conceived in 4 4 , and that is how they hear and count it ( Weiss 2010 , among others). Drummer Tomas Haake has stated that the band learns the music in “chunks” of four, eight, or sixteen measures of 4 4 , supporting the strong form-generating role that these song segments have ( Meshuggah 2012 ). The band’s rhythm guitarist, Mårten Hagström, however, has also emphasized the importance of groove to their compositional approach, comparing their music to funk ( Blabbermouth 2008 ) and saying, “Sometimes people think we set out to create these crazy patterns and then make them work. That’s not how it works . . . You just have to find the groove and then work with the weird stuff until it makes sense” ( Angle 2013 ). Focusing on groove takes some of the emphasis off abstraction and complexity, and instead underlines the role that intuition and “feeling” play in the band’s composing, rehearsing, and performing of this music, and in audience enjoyment of it. “Groove” is, of course, a notoriously slippery musical concept; here, Lawrence Zbikowski’s understanding of groove as a kind of embodied musical knowledge associated with physical movement is particularly useful ( 2004 , 272–297). In the context of the Meshuggah concert described in the opening of this article, both the moshers and the “nerds” in the balcony were searching for the groove—one visibly emphasizing the physical aspects of participation, and the other, the mental, but both experiencing embodied and cognitive musical engagement. The band’s tendency to downplay the complexity of their music not only performs a nonchalant, rock-is-from-the-heart attitude and reassures fans that they need not be theory experts to enjoy the music, but also reminds us of the role of rhythmic instinct as embodied group knowledge in their compositional style. That they are admired by both those who wish to count each rhythmic stream as it goes by as well as by those who would prefer to slam their bodies against one another gives credence to both perspectives.",

Though my analyses focus on the formation and communication of “beginningness,” “middleness,” and “endness,” I wish to distinguish my approach from semiotic and Formenlehre approaches that have focused on this process of signification in the context of tonal music. Most notably, William Caplin’s ( 1998 , 2009 ) notion of formal functions and semiotic studies of tonal music — e.g. those of Kofi Agawu ( 1991 ) and David Lidov ( 2005 ) – have both concerned themselves with how different kinds of musical patterns communicate “beginningness,” “middleness” or “endness,” to the extent that acculturated listeners can arrive late to the symphony and reliably tell where in the movement they are, based solely on the sounds they hear. The establishment of such strong semiotic norms meant that composers such as Haydn could “joke” with audiences, for instance by beginning with a cadential gesture that strongly evoked “ending” (See: Levy 1981 , 355–363). Euroclassical music is unique in its development of strong conventions for indicating beginnings, middles and endings, to the point where listeners have forgotten that there is nothing intrinsic to the sound of a cadence that necessarily says “ending.” While my analyses do investigate the form-generating role of beginnings, middles and endings in Meshuggah’s music, they occur outside of tonality’s cultural frame; Meshuggah’s music enacts neither local nor large-scale tonal processes. As there are no background tonal processes, the analyses remain local and tied to the musical gesture in progress.",

Though the figure that sounds in the beginning of m. 17 seems as if it will re-start the same riff, the rhythmic and pitch patterns do change here, though they are certainly based on the initial riff. The 8-bar verse from mm. 17–24 descends half a step in both voices, hovering around A ♭ and G ♭ . The rhythmic pattern in these eight measures contains elements of mm. 1–16’s 6 riff, as it remains a jagged leaping pattern and makes use of the , and rhythmic elements of the first pattern. There is no set pattern in this verse; it divides into groupings (using to mark “beginnings”) of 21 + 19 + 21 + 11 + 21 + 19 + 16 . “Pineal Gland Optics” has, as far as I can tell, never been performed live by the band. This may be due in part to the difficulties presented by the many conflicting rhythmic processes presented in the various layers. While slower in tempo than many songs, the guitar parts could present memorization difficulties, given the use of complicated isorhythms, the fact that all the riffs are derived from the opening one but none are exactly the same, and that the verse patterns (during vocals) are irregular variations on the opening riff that never quite settle into a repeating riff. Furthermore, the use of patterns that sound as if they begin in the middle, as analyzed here, adds an additional layer of complication from a performance perspective. Though “Pravus” (analyzed below) also makes use of this technique, its context is generally more straightforward, particularly as the drum and cymbal patterns forthrightly support the patterns being performed in the guitar.",

With regard to the riff shown in Examples 14–19, experimental evidence suggests that tones closer together in time tend to be grouped together mentally, as well as those close in pitch (52). The circled notes in Example 14 are only a semitone apart, while the other pitches are a 6th or more lower, in addition to sounding softer, causing the upper As and G ♯ s to hang together in a coherent “stream.”",

Each of the five musicians stakes out his spot on stage and roots himself there, a gear in a sonic war machine. The vocalist plants one foot on the monitor in front of him, opens his chest like an opera singer and roars into a wireless handheld mic. Veins stand out along his temples. His timbre is rough, yet incredibly even, a melody-denying pure percussiveness, each consonant precisely placed. Guitar and bass, often doubling each other at the octave, reverberate with their crisp, metallic chug, pummeling the audience with another layer of percussive blasts. Behind them, the drums battle on with impossible speed, every stroke clear and even. Together, these five humans create an inhuman sound, an assault on the ears that beats the body into motion—a headbanging, fist pumping, body-hurling search for an ever-shifting accent scheme. Grooves develop, only to be cut off and supplanted by new ones. All throughout, the lightshow synchronizes with the music’s rhythms, so that the patterns of the guitar riffs are driven directly into eyes, ears, and bones.

One of them alleged that the band made exactly one mistake that evening (in terms of deviating from the recorded track): a single misplaced sixteenth note. (1) While Meshuggah is hardly the only extreme metal band to write rhythmically complicated music—see, for example, many of the analyses in Osborn 2011 —their compositional style remains grounded in a sense of propulsion and groove that gives their music a visceral, bodily appeal that both draws listeners into the mosh pit and encourages them to listen closely and decipher the rhythmic patterns. Meshuggah’s performances create a musical environment that legitimizes multiple listening strategies; there is pleasure to be found in losing oneself in the mosh pit, as well as in analytic understanding, and Meshuggah’s concerts provide a site where these pleasures can collide, interact, and inform each other. The band’s ability to create music that is both physically and analytically engaging has enabled Meshuggah to remain a standard of the metal scene for nearly three decades, and has also brought them the (dubious, perhaps) honor of being the first extreme metal band to be taken under the wing of academic music theory and its analytical tools (See Pieslak 2007 ).

Toying with the internal rhythmic structures of riffs so that they sound as if they begin in the middle helps illuminate the significant form-generating role of the junctures between song segments. Furthermore, it is these junctures—where an errant riff is subdued by hypermetrical regularity—that provide a site for interrogating human ambivalence with regard to novelty, repetition, the comfort of reliable structures, and the excitement of pushing against those structures. How listeners interacted with Meshuggah’s music at the concert—by counting in the balcony and moshing in the pit, for example—highlights the multiple surface manifestations of human engagement with musical rhythm and form and the embodied pleasures of encountering rhythmic conflict. Finally, the lyrics the vocalist screams offer oblique reflections on the musical structures they inhabit. Particularly, their frequent emphasis on de-tangling systems built on deception, and alternatively, on being trapped in or freeing oneself from these systems dovetails succinctly with the use of musical patterns that ritualize the suppression of elements that break the “order” of a 4 4 -based structure.",

Pitch content is often minimal, seemingly arbitrary and rarely melodic in any conventional sense. Jagged patterns emerge, stop short, and begin again, continually interrupting the familiar and the predictable. Round pegs stuck into square holes, these riffs are simultaneously even and odd, regular and irregular. These feelings of simultaneous conflict and stability are wrought through the band’s primary compositional technique of creating metrically even, large-scale musical structures and filling them with local patterns having conflicting durational spans. Typically, Meshuggah builds songs in segments of eight, sixteen, or thirty-two measures of 4 4 . I use “song segment” to refer to these larger time-spans by which Meshuggah organizes their music, as their songs tend not to have identifiable verses, choruses, etc., though most feature a guitar solo. Songs generally follow a pattern of segments without vocals alternating with segments with vocals (similar to Osborn’s ( 2011 , [27]) “independent verses”). They do repeat riffs, but rarely in a consistently alternating pattern. Furthermore, a song could have a dozen different riffs, with one or two of them repeating at some point.

In many cases, the 4 4 meter remains explicitly articulated, often by means of a steady quarter-note pulse in the cymbals, a backbeat on the snare, or by means of whole notes in the lead guitar marking the 4 4 downbeats. When the looping riff reaches the edge of the eight, sixteen, twenty-four, or thirty-two measure song segment, it is typically cut off wherever it happens to be in its process, and a new riff is initiated on the downbeat of the next segment. (5) The combination of the articulation of phasing rhythmic patterns, the lack of transition between riffs, and the looping of each riff results in rhythmic sensations of lurching, rolling, and stopping short, yet with a lurking continuity as if some invisible ordering force were in control.

To my mind there are (at least) two ways of “getting” this music.

While it is true that the pulses of the 4 4 meter that form the hypermetrical structure are, in most cases, explicitly articulated somewhere in the texture, the perceptual salience of this articulation relative to other patterns can shift over the course of a song, and in some cases seems deliberately hidden away. In their song “Bleed,” for example, the 4 4 pulses are loudly and cleanly articulated in the cymbals for the first 1:25 of the song ( Example 1a ). At this point, the cymbals begin to strike every eighth-note (rather than every quarter) resulting in a blurry wash of sound, while the kick drum begins to pop through more loudly as it articulates the 3 pattern in the guitars. At 1:40, the cymbals also begin following the new pattern (22 ) articulated in the drums and guitars, rendering the vocals the textural layer most expressive of 4 4 until 1:58, when the lead guitar steps in to articulate the 4 4 downbeats ( Example 1b ). The music rarely leaves listeners hanging without an audible 4 4 pulse for long, but the fact that the relative salience of this layer ebbs and flows suggests that while the 4 4 -based hypermetrical structure remains theoretically present, on a moment-to-moment basis, its primacy can be destabilized. Listeners’ ability to hold onto the 4 4 pulse when it is not explicitly articulated will necessarily vary. Even when the 4 4 pulse is explicitly sounded, listeners might choose to attend primarily to other layers. Therefore, while Meshuggah’s compositional technique often comprises what is best described as rhythmic dissonance, I submit that other designations remain possible.",

My analyses are grounded in Hasty’s theory of meter as “projective process,” which emphasizes the importance of heard internal relationships between durations that unfold and develop while listening (ix-x). (9) For Hasty, the perception of metrical rhythms in music is based on the experience and projection of durational spans as they form into patterns of strong and weak beats. A weak or unaccented beat is the result of a prolongation of the mensural potential of an earlier beginning: “if the earlier beginning is still ‘present’ and active—this new beginning will be unaccented and ‘not-beginning’ in relation to the larger event that has already begun and continues to be in the process of becoming” (104). The emergence of a sense of strong and weak occurs not only on a note-by-note level, but also at the level of groups of notes, phrases, and even in the context of the entire piece (114–15). The durational relationships that emerge and form these hierarchies are malleable and subject to change as later events continue to influence their perception. My analysis of these riffs rests primarily at the level of “groups of notes,” examining how they hang together to create a clear rhythmic profile with a distinct beginning, middle, and ending. While I do not follow Hasty’s method of analysis exactly, I do strive to use a style of moment-by-moment analysis derived from his approach to metrical forming that allows for documentation of how a “beginning” could become a “middle” and vice versa. This style of analysis relies on rhythmic intuition that is emergent in listening; the importance of close listening for understanding these analyses cannot be overstated. In keeping with Hasty’s approach, the analyses below describe my (particular, individual) hearing of musical events, but I believe other listeners can share these hearings.

Rhythmic groupings in Meshuggah’s music arise primarily through attack patterns and their accompanying accents. The tendency toward crisp timbres and clear attacks across all instruments, along with the non-melodic use of pitch, gives the music a percussive quality that foregrounds these attack patterns. (10) Dynamic accents, slides, and bends are used to further shape rhythmic gestures. Meshuggah often shapes riffs by means of durational accents, with a long duration delimiting the end of a riff. (11) Contour and registral accents (pitches that stand out because they are higher or lower than the surrounding ones) often help shape the riff’s perceived attack points into a clear rhythmic gesture, sometimes in conjunction with dynamic accents.

I find that the groupings that comprise this riff are particularly intuitive, with pairs of segments relating to each other in a “question and answer” manner loosely reminiscent of antecedent and consequent phrases in a period; the sub-segments of the riff follow a roughly ABA’B’ pattern. Because the groupings are so coherent, a strong sense of rhythmic expectation develops as the riff loops over the sixteen-measure song segment.",

When the riff reaches the end of m. 16, it is just beginning the fourth segment of the 23-beat riff ( B’ ); this abruptly becomes the power-chord pattern of the next song segment at the downbeat of m. 17. This cutting off of a riff in progress, unexpectedly halting its momentum and transferring it to the next pattern is what generates the typical lurching sensation that accompanies listening to a Meshuggah song—a carefully calculated buildup and denial of rhythmic expectation.

The song’s title refers to the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland shaped like a pinecone found in the brains of vertebrates. It produces melatonin and was viewed by Descartes as “the principal seat of the soul” ( Lokhorst 2015 ), and today remains connected to the theosophic concept of the third eye. It is primarily to this latter understanding that Meshuggah refers in the lyrics to this song, which are concerned with mystical visions of a deeper reality; I consider these lyrics later. The opening segment of this song features multiple pitch and rhythmic patterns cycling and falling in and out of alignment with each other. Below, I present each pattern separately before showing the composite. Example 3 shows the eight-attack pitch pattern used in the riff played by the rhythm guitar, a half-step oscillation around A in the upper voice and A ♭ in the lower voice. Example 4 shows the rhythmic pattern used in the riff, which has a length of 14 attacks and a total duration of 12 . Example 5 shows the pitch pattern and rhythmic attack pattern as they are combined into the rhythm guitar part of the opening segment of the song. Over the course of the sixteen-measure song segment, the 8-attack pitch pattern and 14-attack rhythmic pattern cycle against each other, re-aligning only after 56 attack points (at the downbeats of m. 7 and m. 13).",

The hi-hat foot pedal fills in the drums largely at the sixteenth-note level. The snare drum strikes the second half of every beat (arguably articulating 4 4 ). Above these cyclic patterns hangs a solitary tone in the lead guitar, registrally separated from the rest of the music and slowly oscillating between C ♯ and D every eight beats (or two measures of 4 4 ). Cymbal strikes reinforce the temporal beginning of the riff only when it aligns with a change of pitch in the lead guitar (see mm. 1, 7, and 13); otherwise, the temporal beginning of the riff aligns with a sixteenth rest in the cymbal (see mm. 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 16).

The arrival instead on the “wrong” note and a new rhythmic figure feels different than the typical lurch that arises from a riff being cut off mid-stride in the transition to the next song segment; there is a stronger feeling of denied expectation. Unlike the way the accented moment of the “Pineal Gland Optics” riff ushers in the beginning of the verse, here, a strong expectation of such a continuation is created, but then evaded. Whereas the transition between segments one and two of “Pineal Gland Optics” tugs at the rigidity of the segment barrier by blurring beginning and ending, here the boundary is highlighted and made more obvious by the rotation of the riff. “Pravus,” Part Two Example 19 . “Pravus,” 2:31–3:00, rhythm guitars attack pattern (click to enlarge) Example 20 . “Pravus,” 2:31–3:00.

What is particularly interesting about this pattern, however, is the eighth note that sounds halfway through m. 2 of Example 21. Measure 1 contains a statement of what seems like a riff with a duration of 3 . The remainder of m. 1, up until the eighth note in m. 2, sounds like a repetition that extends the pattern by one beat. The eighth note causes a “catching” feeling, that at first listen sounds to me like an ending durational accent. The continuation, however, until the dotted quarter note comes during the sixth beat, demonstrates that both initial projections were incorrect. With repetition, this eighth note in the third beat becomes the marker of a 3 + 4 subdivision of the 7 riff.

The short and long marks alternate, until the midpoint of the riff, when the spectrogram shows two long durations too close together, with no intervening short “catch.” This apparent glitch in the pattern occurs because, at the ninth measure of the song segment, the entire process begins again with the “beginning in the middle”—there is a starting over at the temporal beginning.

The lead guitar’s re-launch of its pitch pattern at the beginning of m. 9 further emphasizes the repetition.

When listening, it is only retrospectively—after the “catch” lasts too long and the next full iteration of the 7 riff has gone by—that we can know there has been a re-statement of the temporal beginning.

At the downbeat of m. 17, it is cut off mid-stride and the lead guitar drops out, but the gesture that begins the new riff continues the same rhythmic pattern, albeit with different pitches. The long low F in beats 2–3 of m. 17 is, however, on the “right” pitch, and is held for the correct dotted quarter note duration. The octaves that begin at the end of m. 17 firmly demonstrate that a new riff has begun.

The opening of “Lethargica” hits the song segment wall abruptly; the rhythmic surface immediately transforms into something else, both rhythmically and texturally. “Pineal Gland Optics,” on the other hand, seems to end its opening segment where it should, the functional end of the riff converging with the seam of the hypermetrical structure. In the first “Pravus” example, a denial of expectation occurs as the segment ends when anticipation is highest in the riff. And later in that song, the ending of one riff blends rhythmically with the beginning of the next, momentarily hiding a typically audible seam. It is the subtleties of these moments that render a description like “regular quadruple hypermetric structure + rhythmically varied surface within that structure” incomplete as an explanation of form in Meshuggah’s music; there is a buoyant push and pull between these elements that suffuses the music with a rhythmic ambivalence that is brought to life in the behaviors of the listeners at the concert, as they respond to this push and pull in their moshing and their counting.

                "text": "[52] In the context of a music culture that values transgressive displays of aggression, Meshuggah’s use of looping riffs that are consistently cut off by a rigid 4 4 -based hypermetric structure enacts a ritual of freedom and control that has long been identified as a core component of metal music’s aesthetic, first described in Robert Walser’s 1993 book Running with the Devil: Power Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music . As Walser writes: Musically, a dialectic is often set up between the potentially oppressive power of bass, drums and rhythm guitar, and the liberating, empowering vehicle of the guitar solo or the resistance of the voice. The feeling of freedom created by the freedom of motion of the guitar solos and fills can be at various times supported, defended or threatened by the physical power of the bass and the violence of the drums. The latter rigidly organize and control time; the guitar escapes with flashy runs and other arrhythmic gestures. The solo positions the listener: he or she can identify with the controlling power without feeling threatened, because the solo can transcend anything. (53–54) Though Walser’s context for this claim is the “freedom” of wild guitar solos arising out of the “control” of the rhythm section, I believe Meshuggah’s riff/structure struggle, which is almost always resolved in favor of the structure, proceeds from this same artistic instinct. With song lyrics often centered on the desire for or achievement of radical freedom from invasive, oppressive, and deceptive systems, and musical patterns that ritualize the suppression of elements that break the “order” of 4 4 , it seems the formal organization of Meshuggah’s music explores ideas of freedom and rigid control, liveliness, and predictability. Just as their manipulations of rhythm exhibit competing realities—one of which exerts control over the other—the texts that Jens Kidman screams often deal with competing realities, and the struggle to either escape a malicious one or discover what is truly real. Take, for example, these lines from “Pineal Gland Optics:” Unbound this new vision, optical regenesis Threatening, so complete in beautiful deformity [ . . . ] Cast off – the concealing veil, the rational cloak of doubt Torn off – the restraints, the blinded’s shackles Burned away – the agony, the fear, the grief A new set of eyes cleansed by a new belief. (23) Here, the text centers on the narrator’s discovery of a perceived truth, in an experience akin to receiving new eyes. The event is life-altering, and brings the subject a heretofore unknown freedom, a reality that is “complete in beautiful deformity.” This lyric remarks on the compatibility of deformity and aesthetic pleasure. Joseph Straus’ ( 2006 , 175) study of concepts of disability in music theory notes that, “musical works often benefit aesthetically from the presence of formal deformations and abnormalities, tonal problems with their attendant imbalance and unrest, and dissonances requiring normalization.” I believe that Meshuggah’s treatment of competing rhythmic strata qualifies for consideration through this lens. The riff struggles to deform the structure, and the structure normalizes the riff, forming boundaries for its excursions and bringing to mind the normative social forces applied to human bodies in everyday life. While Meshuggah’s music does not encode disability per se, analyses of it that employ metaphors involving (a)symmetries and formal “containers” whose boundaries are at risk of perforation, draw on a history of analytical devices that are “unpleasant in [their] unexamined assumption that our bodies and our bodily experiences are all the same” (124); (24) the varied expressions of embodied rhythmic engagement by the moshers and nerds at the concert highlight the absurdity of this assumption. Meshuggah’s use of rotated riffs that threaten the stability of the larger structure reflects on the liveliness and aesthetic pleasure of difference, as well as the competing comfort of regularity and predictability, in this case perfectly represented by 4 4 , with all its attendant history and significance for Western music. “Pineal Gland Optics” and “Pravus” (whose lyrics contemplate the inescapable inevitability of suffering, violence and death: “By the poisoned nails of history stung . . . the blades of hurt inexhaustibly swung”), by playing with the temporal signification of rhythmic grouping, offer yet another way of hearing the encounter between norm and aberration, conformity and rebellion.

With a rhythmic surface that does not easily and immediately yield to interpretation, it comes as no surprise that Meshuggah is the first extreme metal band to inspire a Spectrum article ( Pieslak 2007 ), and I suspect it will only be a matter of time until there is a recognizable, if small, school of “Meshuggah analysis,” like those devoted to other composers and bands. In this article, I have focused on one aspect of their music, dissecting how in some instances, interpretation of the gestures that constitute beginnings and endings can seem to shift as a song segment unfolds, thereby throwing into question the relationship of that riff to the boundaries of its segment. Developing a rhythmic understanding of these moments—indeed the very recognition that a reorientation is taking place—depends on the temporality of listening. Without listening, the lurches and reorganizations that comprise a key element of Meshuggah’s style lose their vitality, and the reason that fans hurl their bodies against each other in the mosh pit grows obscure.",

On the dance floor, this construction occurs in and between bodies as well as in minds. ( 2006 , 137) When listeners tune in to the rhythmic patterns of Meshuggah’s music, or hurl their bodies about the floor in front of the stage, they likewise demonstrate the combination of physical and mental energy that makes a Meshuggah concert such an arresting experience for fans. Further, Vijay Iyer finds that: Music perception and cognition are embodied activities, depending crucially on the tangible features of our sensorimotor apparatus, and also on the sociocultural environment in which music perception, cognition, and production are situated. ( 1998 , 137) Rhythmic understanding, therefore, is both embodied and culture-specific. Iyer also observes that according to neuropsychological data, the mental processes that produce physical movement are the same as those involved in listening to music (30–31). The listeners who appear to be primarily absorbed in the intensely physical process of moshing, are additionally necessarily involved in music cognition, in a sociocultural situation that encourages a distinctly violent mode of musical participation—one that enacts freedom from specific social norms within the control of the musical event.",

The “nerds” in the balcony use embodied cognition of the music for the pleasure of processing the rhythmic patterns as they go by, while preferring to keep the motion in their minds; they and the moshers share more of the concert experience than meets the eye.

Yet if getting in the mood presupposes a preparation, shouldn’t the preparation count as a part of the beginning, or even be reckoned as the real beginning itself?

The song segments begin, and then begin again retrospectively as the groupings sort themselves into their most rhythmically coherent forms. Just as the moshers began their dance “before the beginning,” as a prelude that prepared the entrance of the band, so do these riffs begin before their own beginnings, thereby preparing endings that play with a formal norm of the band’s style.
