    "abstract": "This article proposes that engaging with structural melodic content can expand how we conceive of cadential function and add nuance to the more harmonically driven approaches of Caplinian form-functional theory. Drawing on discussions by Schenker, Marx, and Schoenberg, we posit parallels between structural melodic configurations and the temporal formal functions of Caplinian theory. Through several analytic examples we suggest that certain melodic directions have default association with Caplin’s temporal functions: ascending lines are typically associated with initiating functions, while the static prolongation of structural tones typically serves as either initiating or medial functions. Conversely, descending melodic lines, especially terminating on1ˆ(authentic cadences) or2ˆ(half cadences) are endemic of concluding functions. We do not suggest that melodic considerations replace harmonic ones, but rather conclude that the two domains are symbiotic in the sense that melodic consideration can reinforce or undermine harmonic ones, and vice versa. Ultimately, we use this rebalancing of analytic focus as a means of reengaging with various problematic phrase types and suggest further efficacy for this approach with respect to nineteenth-century formal expansions.",

Other factors, such as the cadence’s metrical position and its dynamic intensity and texture, do not alter the syntactical strength. These factors do, however, determine the rhetorical strength that a particular cadence may make” (2013, 80).",

Felix Diergarten, for instance, writes that “harmonic analyses based on progressions of a basse fondamentale and voice-leading analyses abstracting from dissonances risk neglecting contrapuntal details that were highly important for eighteenth-century musicians,” and suggests that we “rethink the generally accepted notion that in the eighteenth century, ‘cadential classifications become primarily based on harmony rather than on melodic or contrapuntal interval’” (cited in Caplin 2004 , 54; original quotation from Diergarten 2015 , 79). Similarly, Julie Pedneault-Deslauriers and Nathan Martin’s ( 2015 ) survey of half cadences in Mozart invites “further reflection on the relationship between Caplin’s definition of intrathematic functions, couched largely in harmonic and rhythmic/metrical terms, and the various voice-leading patterns that might be correlated with these functions, whether those patterns might be described in terms taken over from Schenker or from Gjerdingen” ( Martin and Pedneault-Deslauriers 2015 , 205). Martin Rohrmeir and Markus Neuwirth attack the issue more directly, concluding that “the bare harmonic essence may not be capable of providing the differentia specifica to other (non-cadential) types of progressions” ( 2015 , 288).",

At all times, however, a definite harmonic process is closed, since the harmonies associated with the cadence always bring to some degree of completion a broader harmonic progression beginning prior to the onset of the cadence. Often, we can identify a distinctly melodic process closed by cadences, such as when, in the case of a perfect authentic cadence (PAC), the melodic line descends to the tonic scale degree” ( Caplin 2004 , 56–57).

Much of the discussion either revolves around, or builds on, William Caplin’s ( 1998 ) theory of formal functions, a theory whose “outstanding achievement” is the definition of formal functions in intrinsic terms, and whose taxonomy, in part, is characterized by the presence (or absence) of various cadences. (1) Caplin himself describes cadences as events that bring about closure by “essentially represent[ing] the structural end of broader harmonic, melodic, and phrase-structural processes” ( 1998 , 43); while this is certainly not the only possible definition of a cadence, this is the one we will adopt for the purposes of this paper. (2) In practice, however, form-functional theory and analysis typically accentuates only harmonic and phrase-structural elements, rarely giving the same weight to melodic considerations. (3) This selective focus is something for which Caplin advocates in his early treatise, where he argues that local harmonic progression should be “the most important factor in expressing formal functions” ( 1998 , 5). Steven Vande Moortele refers to this focus on harmony as a “self-imposed methodological restriction,” observing that melodic considerations are often “conspicuously absent from [form-functional theory]” ( 2013 , 407).

The phrase’s harmonic structure similarly consists of an initial tonic prolonged via a neighboring dominant, which then concludes on the dominant with no intervening predominant.

This differentiation arises owing to questions of cadential closure. In Example 1, the concluding dominant is determined to support a half cadence, while it is unlikely that a similar rhetorical pause would be assigned to the dominant in m. 4 of Example 2. Indeed, having used both examples in pedagogical contexts, the lack of a cadence in the Beethoven concerto is often a point of confusion: the grouping structure, the harmonic progression, and the repose generated by the subsequent silence frequently prompt students to interpret this moment as a half cadence (which consequently complicates analyzing the rest of this theme). Consideration of what follows immediately after Example 2’s m. 4 does not alleviate these challenges: mm. 5–8 are a repetition of mm. 1–4 but ending with a V–I motion, which in conjunction with the pause on V in m. 4 gives the impression of an antecedent-consequent relationship within the first eight measures. (6) It requires an even further step back to determine that, at the sixteen-measure level, the theme resembles a compound sentence, and it is typically this criteria that is used to rationalize why no cadence coalesces in m. 4. (7) In other words, distinguishing why there is no cadence (especially when put into relief against a comparable passage such as Example 1) relies on navigating multiple levels of conflicting intrinsic and contextual information: based on the antecedent characteristics at the four-measure level there should be a cadence in m. 4; based on the periodic characteristics at the eight-measure level we might equally say that there must be cadences in m. 4 and m. 8; but these two levels conflict with the sixteen-measure level, whose sentential features suggest there must not be cadences at these points.",

While seasoned analysts might point out the role of surrounding contexts and the effects of retrospective reinterpretation, (8) the question we would like to raise, at this juncture, is whether there are other intrinsic parameters at play that might help explain, or at least reinforce, why there is a cadence in one passage, but not the other. Notably, nothing has hitherto been said about the melodic dimension of these passages, and as we previously noted, it is an element that is rarely given the same systematic consideration as harmony and grouping structure in form-functional theory and analysis. Caplin does acknowledge that presentation phrases typically “project an ‘opening up’ of melodic space through ascending gestures” ( 2013 , 38), and likewise describes that “the general melodic contour of a cadence is descending” ( 2013 , 56); however these observations, and implications derived from them, rarely feature prominently in either his analyses or theoretic models. (9) Thus, while Vande Moortele’s claim of melody being “conspicuously absent” from Caplin’s approaches may perhaps be overstated, melody is certainly not accorded the same level of importance as harmony and grouping structure. When questions of melodic function are considered, most often it is as a means of differentiating between Perfect and Imperfect Authentic Cadences. (10)",

(11) Thus, our aim is to neither diminish nor exclude the roles of harmony or phrase structure, but rather to highlight their symbiotic relationship with structural melody, and to demonstrate how considerations of the structural melodic line contribute an additional level of nuance into Caplin’s more harmonically driven approach to formal analysis. Drawing on discussions by theorists whose work has influenced the new Formenlehre tradition, such as Heinrich Schenker, Adolf Bernhard Marx, and Arnold Schoenberg, the first section of the paper proposes a distinction between structural melodic lines and the melodic surface. (12) Specifically, we engage with Marx’s observations that melodies can be viewed in the abstract to project a more directed ascent or descent, despite the various changes in direction that occur on the musical surface, and integrate Marx’s perspective with Schenker’s more interpretive Urlinie in order to provide a means of discussing melody in a more structural way. In the second section, we then extrapolate several melodic processes that can be interpreted more taxonomically through form-functional terminology: ascending and static lines are often associated with initiating or medial functions, while descending lines, especially to 1 ˆ (or an interrupted 2 ˆ in the case of half cadences), are almost always associated with concluding, and thus cadential, functions. (13) The third and fourth sections then apply these melodic considerations to formal functions, and discuss instances where harmonic and phrase-structural considerations alone are insufficient in understanding closure. Ultimately, we advocate that a renewed focus on melodic considerations allows for further levels of nuance in interpreting cadences, and that such a focus will provide another parameter to consider in discussing more idiosyncratic cases of formal ambiguity. 1.

Melody, however, is far more open-ended, with the possibilities for successions of notes being virtually limitless and restricted by fewer constraints than harmonic successions. One well-recognized means of abstracting melody comes in the form of the Schenkerian Urlinie , or fundamental line. As Schenker describes it, the fundamental line is “a melodic succession of definite steps of a second [which] signifies motion, striving toward a goal, and ultimately the completion of this course” ( [1935] 1979 , 4–5). (14) Elaborating further, he suggests that “this is the fundamental, determinate melodic succession, the primal design of melodic content.” Schenker’s treatment of the Urlinie , however, is most often applied to deep levels of structure, and as such is often highly abstracted from the successions of pitches as they are heard on the melodic surface, or even at a more middleground level. (15) But rather than using the concept of a fundamental line as a procrustean bed for deep-level musical structure, we propose to adapt the model as means of describing the overarching melodic proclivities at the level of the phrase.

In this sense, we feel by nature that the fundamental line must lead downward until it reaches 1 ˆ , and that the bass must fall back to the fundamental. With 1 ˆ /I all tensions in a musical work cease. In short, what Schenker is noting on a technical level is a tendency in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century European tonal music for the melodic line to gravitate in a descending direction toward the tonic pitch at the conclusion of a musical unit, which creates, as Schenker describes, a feeling of conclusion and release of tension.",

Marx ( [1868] 1997 , 38) describes melody in a similar manner: One can easily observe that ascending successions awaken the feeling of intensification, elevation, and tension, while falling successions awaken the contrasting feelings of slackening, depression and the return to rest. Marx thus ascribes different sensations to melodies that ascend—which he describes as a process of “elevation from repose, and intensification . . . up to a natural high point”—from those that descend, which by contrast lead “to the tone of true repose [the tonic]” ( [1868] 1997 , 43). Marx’s description here is useful in providing further context to Schenker’s claims: since an increase in tension cannot, by definition, create a sense of repose, this in turn implies that the articulation of a cadence—defined in Caplinian terms as a concluding function and a point wherein the processes of a musical unit come to a cessation and conclusion—typically achieves a state of repose and conclusion through a melodic descent.

How preposterous therefore to try to fashion an organic, living work by assembling various tone series without background!” To interpres his metaphorical prose, Schenker is noting that despite the almost infinite number of possibilities by which a melody might occur at the musical surface, it is possible to trace a more abstract, or structural, underlying motion in tonal melodies. Again, Marx’s prose presents a perspective similar to Schenker’s, but presented in more conventional terms. Marx describes melodic successions that switch between an ascent and descent on the surface as “roving” progressions; they “hold fast to neither side but partake of both. And yet no matter how their individual tones may roam, they can belong in the main to one of the two primary directions” ( [1868] 1997 , 38). For instance, despite all of the surface-level melodic figuration in Example 3 , a more structural melody—that begins on 3 ˆ (B), remains static on that pitch (via a neighbouring 4 ˆ (C) in mm. 3–5), before descending from 3 ˆ through 2 ˆ , to 1 ˆ at the point of cadential articulation in m. 8—can also be traced.

As shown in Example 4 , the melody in the second movement of Eine kleine Nachtmusik begins on E ( 3 ˆ ) and passes up through F ( 4 ˆ ) to land on 5 ˆ on the first beat of m. 2. This 5 ˆ is then prolonged via a neighboring 6 ˆ before the melodic line begins a descent from 5 ˆ in m. 3 down to 2 ˆ in m. 4, where the line stops in conjunction with the half cadence (the entire structure is then repeated in the consequent phrase, but this time leads instead to 1 ˆ ). (17) Conversely, despite the ascending and descending surface-level scalar motion in the first eight measures of Beethoven’s First Piano Concerto in Example 2, the underlying melodic motion, as shown in Example 5 , is as an ascent: from 1 ˆ to 2 ˆ in mm. 1–4, and from 2 ˆ to 3 ˆ in mm. 4–8. This 3 ˆ is supported by a prolongation of tonic harmony through the next four measures before stepping back down through 1 ˆ (itself prolonged first by an upper and lower neighbor (E and C ♯ ), as well as by a surface-level unfolding down to 7 ˆ ) to return to 1 ˆ at the end of the phrase in m. 16. In other words, the melodic lines of the two phrases diverge significantly: Example 1 contains an ascent to 5 ˆ followed by a descent to 2 ˆ , while Example 2 contains only an ascent (this characterization likewise holds for the subsequent four-measure units in each case). 2.

Haydn, Symphony no. 104, iii, mm. 1–8 (analysis reflecting that of Schmalfeldt 1991, 240) (click to enlarge) In this respect, Schenker’s own writings on the matter are interesting, but somewhat inconclusive. At one time, he refers to the final 2 ˆ – 1 ˆ (supported by V–I) component of the Ursatz as a “cadential formula,” thus suggesting that the preceding 3 ˆ ( 5 ˆ or 8 ˆ ) represents material of an initiating (as well as possibly medial) formal function. ( 2004 , 64) (18) In effect, Caplin is translating Schenkerian terminology into his form-functional language, a process that can be refined and taxonomized even further. There are, of course, many ways in which even a middleground melody could unfold prior to a cadence. For instance, Example 3 above sees 3 ˆ as its initiating element, while a prolongation of 3 ˆ via the neighboring 4 ˆ serves a medial role prior to the onset of the descent through 2 ˆ to 1 ˆ which serves as a concluding gesture. Alternately, 3 ˆ or 5 ˆ might serve as the initiating function, resulting in the medial function having a more protracted descent to the concluding 1 ˆ . This is precisely the case in the minuet from Joseph Haydn’s Symphony No. 104, which Janet Schmalfeldt ( 1991 , 240–242) analyzes: as shown in Example 6 with stems reproducing Schmalfeldt’s analysis, 5 ˆ is prolonged throughout the presentation, while the descent to 4 ˆ occurs in conjunction with the onset of the continuation.

Schmalfeldt ( 1991 , 254) demonstrates such an ascent in her analysis of Haydn’s Keyboard Sonata in G Major, Hob. XVI: 27, shown in Example 7 . According to Schmalfeldt, the ascent occurs over the course of the presentation phrase, with the progression from G up to B serving as the melodic initiating function. The continuation then prolongs 3 ˆ , before concluding with a descent to 2 ˆ to create the half cadence in m. 8. (19) Example 8 .

While there is nothing particularly controversial about cadences in this example, it provides an excellent comparative opportunity to consider the relationships between melody and formal functions. In m. 8 there is a move from the dominant (that had harmonized the repetition of the basic idea) to the tonic that does not sound particularly cadential. A similar resolution from V to I occurs in m. 15, this time sounding far more conclusive. If we consider the melodic character, first of the presentation, then of the entire theme, it becomes apparent that there is an intrinsic reason for the distinction between the two similar events. As in the Haydn sonata above, mm. 1–8 contain an ascending melodic line, from 1 ˆ over the initial basic idea (mm. 1–4), through 2 ˆ over its repetition (mm. 5–8), to 3 ˆ at the outset of the continuation in m. 8. 3 ˆ is then prolonged via a neighboring motion, before stepping down though (the implied) 2 ˆ , to conclude on 1 ˆ at the point of cadential articulation in m. 15. For us, the difference in melodic content provides a means of articulating structural differences between these two V–I motions: (20) in m. 8 the melodic tension is still in the process of increasing, as the initiating function of the melody has just reached its apex. Following a medial prolongation of this apex, the melody then descends, leading to its concluding 2 ˆ – 1 ˆ motion over the V–I harmony as the tension dissipates. (21)",

On the contrary, the characteristic melodies of opening gestures tend to feature a diversity of intervallic content (combinations of leaps, steps, and directional changes) and a variety of durational patterning. One might therefore generalize that the directional proclivity of a melodic line associates it with certain formal functions. Ascending melodic lines (e.g., in Examples 1, 2, 7, and 8) are generally more characteristic of initiating functions, while static ones (e.g., in Examples 3 and 6) are equally characteristic of both initiating and medial functions. (22) Ascending and static lines, however, rarely correlate to concluding functions, whose first-level default (used conceptually after Hepokoski and Darcy 2006 ) is characterized by a descending melodic line (see Caplin 2013 , 56–57, especially Example 2.22). Schoenberg discusses cadential melodic contours in just such terms, describing how “in order to exercise the function of a cadence, the melody must assume certain characteristics, producing a special cadence contour , which usually contrasts with what precedes it” ( 1967 , 29–30, italics original). (23) He goes on to describe how the melody will often recede from a climax, a “decline in contour, [which] combined with concentration of the harmony and liquidation of motivic obligations, can be depended on to provide effective delimitation of the structure.” (24)",

Applying criteria from a structural-melodic parameter offers a means of distinguishing between these two phrases. As shown in Example 4, the melodic structure in the second movement of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik begins with an ascent characteristic of initiating function (from 3 ˆ to 5 ˆ ), which is then followed by a medial function where 5 ˆ is prolonged, and finally a concluding descent to 2 ˆ . By contrast, the melody in the first four measures of the Beethoven concerto consists only of a melodic initiating function, as the melody ascends from 1 ˆ to 2 ˆ (and then 2 ˆ to 3 ˆ in mm. 5–8), a behavior that would be highly atypical of the concluding function associated with cadential articulation.

(26) It is not until m. 16 that the melodic processes of the theme come to a conclusion, when the melody undergoes a descent from 3 ˆ , through 2 ˆ , to 1 ˆ , while the harmonies that support this descent present a conventional cadential progression of ii 6 –V 7 –I.",

Again, our aim is not to minimalize or exclude the role of harmony, phrase structure, context, or any other parameter, but rather to highlight how they can be complemented by structural melody. A perfectly smooth melodic descent to 1 ˆ or 2 ˆ will not generate a cadence if the harmonic progression does not support it; conversely, harmonic progressions that might appear cadential can be overridden by melodic configurations that project non-concluding functions. (27) Simply put, melody is another parameter through which we can systematically engage, refine, and in some cases, enhance our understanding of what processes contribute to musical-syntactic closure. Such considerations also give an additional intrinsic functional explanation to specific cases where Caplinian theory currently resorts to contextual relationships, despite—as we cited at the beginning of the article—its outstanding achievement being the articulation of intrinsic functionality.

Poundie Burstein ( 2014 and 2015 ), however, has also suggested that cadential articulations are not always as cut-and-dry as a taxonomic theory of formal functions might suggest: “In many specific instances determining a phrase’s cadential status can be quite tricky. At times even seasoned scholars disagree on matters such as where a phrase ends or whether its ending should be regarded as a half or full cadence” ( 2014 , 203). Burstein’s observations are mostly directed toward cases wherein it is difficult to discern whether a phrase’s endpoint is a HC or whether the dominant continues through and resolves to the subsequent tonic. More broadly, however, he points out that analytic interpretation of cadential events both influences and is influenced by analytic readings of voice-leading structures within a musical phrase. Sometimes we find cadential harmonic progressions in places where we intuit there should not be a cadence, and it is in these cases where we could look beyond harmony to describe why we do not interpret a cadence.

In his analysis of this theme, Caplin ( 1998 , 64–65) refers to the first four measures as a “regular presentation phrase,” and thus does not analyze a half cadence in m. 4. Burstein, on the other hand, offers a more detailed description, writing that the “V of m. 4 marks the end of melodic, rhythmic, and phrase-structural process[es], but as the end of a presentation phrase, it is not classified as a cadence” ( 2015 , 86–87). Burstein’s assessment is enlightening: if a cadence is an event that closes melodic, harmonic, and phrase-structural processes, what prevents the arrival on V in the fourth measure from articulating such an event? In this case, consideration of the structural melodic line reinforces Caplin’s analysis: as depicted by the stems in Example 9, the melody rises from 1 ˆ ( A ♭ ) in mm. 1–2, to 2 ˆ ( B ♭ ) in mm. 3–4, before reaching 3 ˆ (C) in m. 5; it only falls at m. 8. In other words, while the phrase-structural and harmonic processes may signal a conclusion in m. 4, the melodic line is still in its initiating phase; its processes do not end in m. 4 and start again in m. 5, but rather continue through m. 4 only to conclude at the end of the eight-measure unit. Considering this middleground melody thus helps explain why m. 4 should not be interpreted as cadential despite cues to the contrary. (29) Example 10 .

As Burstein describes, interpreting a HC “is supported by the hypermeter, the momentary melodic pause in m. 4, and the rhythmic drive in m. 3 that leads to the root-position V in the next measure” ( 2014 , 208). Burstein contrasts these features with those that speak against a cadence, specifically: the sense of closure here is undercut by the slurs and descent in the bass that span mm. 4–5, as well as by the highly continuational nature of what follows in mm. 5–8. In other words, since it is so strongly linked to an ensuing passage that seems much like what typically is found midphrase, this in turn suggests that the V in m. 4 might likewise be best interpreted as lying midphrase. It thus is not surprising that some have suggested that the V of m. 4 should be understood not as part of a half cadence but instead as part of an unbroken tonal motion that embraces mm. 1–8. ( 2014 , 208) (30) The status of the dominant chord in m. 4 is further complicated by the fact that it occurs after a two-measure BI followed by a two-measure CI whose harmonic underpinning is a complete cadential progression: the tonic in m. 3 progresses through vi to the applied predominant V of V, and then to the dominant in m. 4. In addition to the cues Burstein cites, the presence of a complete T–PD–D harmonic progression gives further weight to understanding the dominant in m. 4 as a half cadence. However, as Burstein describes, what follows is continuational, and the melodic and harmonic processes do not restart, as would often be the case following a half cadence. (31)",

As shown in the analysis, the opening four measures of the phrase consist of a melodic arpeggiation from 3 ˆ to 5 ˆ , which remains prolonged as the active tone through m. 4: it is neighbored by the F in m. 5, and only begins its descent in m. 7, through D down to B ♭ (the A ♭ and G are motions to an inner voice) and finally to the tonic A ♭ in m. 8. The melodic structure in mm. 1–4 thus suggests only initiating (the initial arpeggiation) and medial (the prolongation of 5 ˆ ) functions, with the concluding descent being absent until mm. 7 and 8. (32) Combined with the elements Burstein discusses, such as the continuation of dominant function through the vii o in the subsequent measure and the lack of harmonic or melodic return in m. 5, our reading argues against a HC in m. 4 despite the admittedly strong predominant function afforded by the applied V of V.

This theme comes across as being peculiar, owing to a high degree of repetition at the musical surface, ambiguity regarding how the theme’s two halves relate to each other, and whether the V–I progression in m. 4 constitutes a cadence. At first glance, mm. 1–4 appears presentational: a two-measure basic idea is followed by another two measures that closely resemble it in terms of rhythmic profile. However, the two units are quite different: melodically, mm. 1–2 arpeggiate the tonic (from 3 ˆ to 5 ˆ to 1 ˆ , then back to 3 ˆ ) while mm. 3–4 contain 6 ˆ – 1 ˆ – 2 ˆ – 3 ˆ ; harmonically, mm. 1–2 are tonic prolongational through the descending thirds sequence, whereas mm. 3–4 concludes the sequence before moving to what could be the initial I 6 of a cadential progression.

Indeed, concluding function does not materialize until m. 7: after the BI returns in m. 5, the D ( 5 ˆ ) in m. 5 pivots to become 1 ˆ in the dominant, which then arpeggiates up to F ♯ via the neighboring G. From here, the F ♯ then descends through E to reach the local 1 ˆ , D, at the articulation of a V: PAC in m. 8. (34) In this case, consideration of melody does indeed have a demonstrable bearing on how we interpret the form of the phrase in question—if interpreted as an antecedent, this suggests that the melodic processes close at m. 4 and start again in m. 5, whereas if interpreted as a CBI, the melodic processes are left open after m. 4, and close only in m. 8.

Here, however, the question of whether there is a cadence in m. 4 has important implications beyond simply determining whether the first four measures are an antecedent or a CBI. Caplin’s analysis of the theme suggests that it is a compound period made up of two parallel eight-measure ANT+CONT hybrids. As such, he analyzes a half cadence in both m. 4 and m. 12. Despite being recognized within form-functional theory, however, the compound antecedent = ANT+CONT construction is problematic against Caplin’s contention that an antecedent, by definition, must contain a cadence that is weaker than the one that closes the theme. This means that in Op. 26, not only does the cadence at m. 16 have to be stronger than the one at m. 8—an unproblematic assertion—the one in m. 4 should also be weaker than the one at m. 8. Since the HC at m. 8 already represents the weakest cadence, the cadence in m. 4 cannot be comparatively weaker unless one wants to further subdivide half-cadential strengths. (36)",

Indeed, analyses put forth by Schenker ( [1935] 1979 , Fig. 85), as well as David Beach, make a point of accentuating that m. 4 is not a cadence, but merely a phrase-dividing dominant. Beach, for instance, writes that it is necessary to determine “a distinction between the dominant in m. 4 (or m. 12), which is the division of the phrase, and the dominant in m. 8, which in the hierarchy is the more important of the two. That is, the dominant in m. 8 is the goal of the phrase (as the tonic in m. 16 is the goal of the consequent phrase), while the dominant in m. 4/12 marks a division of the phrase” ( 1989 , 13). Beach’s prose clarifies his reasoning: Example 13 . Analysis of Beethoven, Piano Sonata no. 12, op. 26, I, mm. 1–8 (click to enlarge) [The V in m. 4] cannot be considered equivalent to the dominant in m. 8. Rather . . . it divides the phrase while prolonging the tonic. The harmony moves beyond this point to the subdominant, which is subsequently prolonged, and then on to the dominant in m. 8. Thus, the controlling harmonic progression for this eight-bar antecedent phrase is I-IV 6 -V, with the dominant in m. 4 functioning . . . as a means of dividing the phrase. ( 1989 , 39) In other words, Beach’s reading (which closely resembles Schenker’s), sees the V in m. 4 not as a cessation of tonal processes, but one that continues those processes. While Beach accentuates harmonic continuity, our reading of mm. 1–8 in Example 13 suggests that melodic continuity is also a factor in this theme.",

(37) While we agree with Beach’s latter observation, we find his and Schenker’s use of this specific C as the onset of the melodic line problematic. First, because it arises from a voice exchange with the bass, we read it as a neighbor tone embellishing the B ♭ that arises from the more structural A ♭ . Second, if this C is indeed the structural upper voice, it cannot both immediately step back down to B ♭ and not be a cadence. Both Schenker and Beach acknowledge this second problem, but interpret the descent from 3 ˆ to 2 ˆ in m. 4 as an inner-voice process, despite B ♭ being clearly articulated in the upper voice.",

One potential criticism we want to address is that in taking the C in m. 5 as the structural note, we are choosing what appears to be a note supported by an unstable six-four sonority. On the surface this is true, but our reading suggests that that C has been displaced from sounding over the F on the downbeat of m. 5. In other words, the V of m. 4 progresses deceptively to vi, but the consonant fifth above F is displaced by the sixth, D ♭ —which we hear as a remnant of the preceding V (its seventh) whose delayed appearance over F creates the impression of IV 6 but which is ultimately a neighboring note to 3 ˆ , a reading which correlates to Beach’s assessment that the V in m. 4 prolongs tonic. (38) From here, F in the bass passes down through its seventh ( E ♭ ) to V of V, followed by V , which resolves to I 6 at the end of m. 6. The submediant then returns in the bass—once again with a D ♭ displacing the fifth such that it resembles a IV 6 on the surface—before resolving to the cadential dominant in m. 8. (39)",

In addition to the continuation of harmonic processes via the move from V to IV 6 (vi), the melodic processes likewise remain open: the ascent from 1 ˆ to 3 ˆ in mm. 1–5 is endemic of initiating function, while the prolongation of 3 ˆ through mm. 5–7 reflect medial function, and the descent from 3 ˆ to 2 ˆ in m. 8 is characteristic of concluding function, which coordinates with the harmony to articulate a half cadence.

In Example 14, the underlying harmonic progression of mm. 1–2 suggests a half-cadential gesture: I–vii o6 /V–V. Of course, these measures contain only what Caplin ( 2004 , 81–85) calls cadential content and not cadential function: not only is cadential function denied on the basis of grouping structure, we can see that the melodic structure conflicts with the harmonic one. As shown in Example 15 , the upper line begins on 1 ˆ (having arpeggiated down from 5 ˆ in the pickup), which remains the active tone throughout m. 1. When the harmony changes to the dominant in m. 2, 1 ˆ steps up to 2 ˆ , increasing the melodic tension. Measures 3–4 function in a similar manner but support a further ascent to 3 ˆ over the V –I progression, which given the inverted dominant is clearly non-cadential. As in several of the previous examples, the presentation in its entirety supports an initiating melodic function in the form of an ascent from 1 ˆ to 3 ˆ . Thus, while the harmonic content of mm. 1–2 could be described as a cadential progression, its melodic content is more typical of initiating function. (41)",

We can once again see how the melody signals that mm. 1–4 are only in their initiating stages: mm. 1–2 exhibit a melodic structure typical of initiating functions as 1 ˆ (C) is prolonged via a neighbor motion before arpeggiating up to 3 ˆ , which is prolonged via the same upper-neighbor figure in mm. 3–4.

In his commentary on this theme, Caplin notes that Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983, 62) refer to the tonic arrivals in m. 3 and m. 5 as cadences, but counters by adding that If we identify cadences at the downbeats of measures 3 and 5, as do Lerdahl and Jackendoff, then we must ask exactly what formal units these cadences are closing. Clearly, it is too early to speak of closing the main theme itself, for when we consider the broader context, we can identify a sentence structure for that theme as a whole, one whose promised cadential close is initially denied by the deceptive cadence in measure 10, but then realized by the perfect authentic cadence in measure 12. To the extent that we want to identify cadences at the downbeats of measures 3 and 5, it is best to see them functioning to provide closure to the basic idea itself, but having no further effect on the theme. For at the level of the theme, a basic idea is exclusively an opening idea; that idea itself cannot bring a formal cadence. ( 2004 , 86)",

Here, our analysis shows that the melodic structure of the basic idea and its repetition serves to prolong the tonic scale degree, despite the surface-level scalar ascent from C up to A and back down again in each two-measure unit. There are several reasons for this interpretation. Firstly, neither the melodic D nor F in m. 1 are supported, suggesting that this first measure is merely a decorated arpeggiation of the tonic triad—an opening flourish of sorts. As such, we interpret the F and the A on the downbeat in m. 2 as covering tones that arise from motion from an inner voice: if we reduce the voice leading in this passage to a four-part harmonic context, as shown in Example 19 , under the auspices of idealized voice-leading employing the path of least motion, we see that the F and A are neighbors to the inner-voice E and G in the tonic chord, and the D and B serve as a double neighbor around the tonic pitch.

As shown in Example 20 , it is only once the presentation portion of the theme concludes that the melody begins to exhibit activity, launching into an ascent to 5 ˆ in m. 8. This ascent is then followed by a descent—first interrupted by the deceptive resolution in m. 10, but rectified by the reprise in mm. 11–12—to the structural tonic over a conventional cadential harmonic progression. These observations in some ways reinforce Caplin’s notion of limited-scope cadences, but suggest that it is not so much that the cadences are limited in scope, but rather that there is a conflict between the harmonic domain (which contains cadential content) and the melodic one (which does not).

                "text": "[4.6] Related to the looping structure, Vande Moortele ( 2013 , 412–13) describes something he terms a “large-scale sentence with periodic presentation,” as illustrated by the main theme of Beethoven’s “Bridgetower [Kreutzer]” sonata, shown in Example 21 . Citing Schmalfeldt’s ( 2011 , 93–97) analysis of this passage, Vande Moortele notes that it can be viewed as a large sentence, in which mm. 19–27 and their subsequent repetition form two large-scale BIs (made up of a two-measure BI followed by fragmentation), which then group with the continuational mm. 37–45 to create a sentence. The challenge, as Vande Moortele ( 2013 , 413) points out, is that in contrast to the more typical Mozartean Loops, in Beethoven’s theme, the cadences at the end of the initiating nine-bar unit and its repetition are not elided and therefore cannot be considered to be undone. As the conclusion of nine-bar chunks, moreover, they can hardly be said to be of limited scope. Rather, they appear as a correlate of this music’s expanded scale, which gives rise to the presence of an additional formal level. Here we have a case where the apparent cadences are even more pronounced, and thus present what Vande Moortele refers to as a risk in terms of conflation of levels: “because the large-scale basic idea and its repetition stand in an antecedent-consequent relationship which is articulated by cadences, the cadence at the end of the consequent might be mistaken for the end of the theme” ( 2013 , 413).",

                "text": "[4.7] Schmalfeldt, however, describes an important feature of both large-scale basic ideas. Her reading of mm. 19–27 (and its repetition), shown by the beamed notes in Example 21, “proposes that a stepwise\nascent through the interval of a seventh—<F– G ♯ –A–B–C–D–E>—fundamentally carries the violinist’s line to the primary tone of the movement, the mediant-supported E ♮ as 5 ˆ at the fermata” ( 2011 , 94). Schmalfeldt thus explains why one might not interpret a cadence at m. 27 despite other cues suggesting one: the melodic domain is still in its initiating phase, ascending from 6 ˆ below the tonic up to the dominant tone. It is only in the continuation at m. 37ff. that the melody projects medial and concluding function, as 5 ˆ is first prolonged before making its way back down to 1 ˆ in m. 45; the arrival on the tonic coincides with what Schmalfeldt describes as “the first and only genuine authentic cadence thus far” ( 2011 , 96).

(47) Since Vande Moortele describes the “large-scale sentence” as being more closely tied to nineteenth-century style, the category provides a way for us to apply considerations of melodic structure beyond the Classical style. Rather than having a periodic presentation, however, this large-scale sentence has CBIs that end in apparent IACs in the local tonic of A ♭ major (m. 75 and m. 79). Unlike the “Bridgetower” sonata, both cadences remain in the tonic; nevertheless, they also have less-apparent looping structures. As shown in Example 23 , the structural melody of both CBIs ascends from 2 ˆ ( B ♭ ) to 3 ˆ (C), with surface-level embellishments prolonging both scale degrees over the course of the presentation. C remains the active tone, prolonged now by an upper-neighbor D ♭ , and only begins its descent at the end of the continuation phrase. Ultimately, the theme does not create a conclusive cadence in A ♭ , but rather reopens both the melodic and harmonic structure through a deceptive resolution to V 7 /IV, after which the music moves away from A ♭ . 5.

In particular, the urge to generalize leads to the idea that cadential formulae can be cordoned off from the music that precedes, and leads to, the cadence. However, Rohrmeir and Neuwirth state that attempts at articulating specific cadential features “may not be capable of providing the differentia specifica to other (non-cadential) types of progressions” ( 2015 , 288). This is true not only in the harmonic domain, but also in attempts to relegate the cadence to a specifically local set of voice-leading configurations. While a cadence thus has certain formulaic features, it is also highly dependent on what precedes it. Caplin ( 2004 , 56) acknowledges this fact almost axiomatically (“a cadence must end something”—italics Caplin’s). Here, we show that this “something” can, and should, include melodic processes, in addition to harmonic and phrase-structural ones. Example 24 .

In more ambiguous cases, the melodic structure provides an additional means of articulating the distinction between “cadential content” and “cadential function.” Conversely, however, considerations of melodic structure could also inform cases where melodic factors, rather than harmonic ones, contribute to ambiguity. The conclusion of Frédéric Chopin’s Prelude Op. 28, no. 9 shown in Example 24 , for instance, closes with a V 7 –I cadence, but this ending still somehow feels incomplete. One reason for this sense of inconclusiveness could be found in the atypical melodic structure, which rises from 5 ˆ , through ♭ 6 ˆ , ♭ 7 ˆ , 7 ˆ , to 1 ˆ . Despite this moment appearing resoundingly cadential in terms of harmonic and contextual considerations, the ascending melodic line gives the sense of an increasing tension, rather than the decrease in tension usually associated with cadences. (48) This is not to say that this is not a cadence, but rather that sensitivity to the melody allows one to articulate that this ascending line is not of the default type typically associated with Classical-style cadential articulation. This in turn allows for a greater dialogic engagement—not only with this specific piece, but with other works whose melodic content is atypical. (49)",

However, Harrison also cautions that “the project also has shown signs of making cadence a creature of formal function in a particular repertory and stylistic practice. That is, a broadly general theory of cadence as a musical effect, convention, and structure seems in danger of losing out to a particularistic theory of cadential function in the galant style.” This leads Harrison to conclude that “putting the cadence into a dependent relationship with classical formal functions leads to an impoverishment of recognized cadence types.”",

If a cadence closes something, it stands to reason that understanding what it closes is as important as understanding the mechanics of that closure in more generalized terms. As such, attempts to cordon off generalized “cadential formulae” can only get us so far. In that sense, we share a common cause with Harrison’s concerns regarding Caplin’s somewhat restrictive definition of cadence. Our view of the melodic role of the cadence, however, also positions us to see certain types of initiating, medial, and closing structural melodic motions as synchronizing well with Caplin’s broader theoretic claims. As we noted, structural melodic ascents, or structural melodic stasis, appears to be relatively consistent in their association with initiating function, while a structural descent is the default associated with concluding function. These melodic functions exist in a symbiotic relationship with harmony: either dimension has the ability to undermine the other, and musical drama plays out when considering the ways in which the structural melody and the structural harmony reinforce, diverge from, or contradict each other.",

We can, for instance, describe in greater detail the disjunction of melodic and harmonic conclusions, and the ways in which they work in tandem to delay, defer, or obscure the conclusion of the melodic and harmonic processes of a phrase. Taking the step to accord the structural melodic features a place at the table in discussions of formal functions serves to open the theory to greater and more varied applications. For instance, while nineteenth-century harmonic innovations have long held a prominent place in music-theoretic discourse, melodic innovations have been considered far less often. Indeed, we might go as far as to note that a greater sensitivity to the role of melody could allow for future research to generate an increasingly nuanced dialogue between nineteenth-century processes and their predecessors in the late eighteenth century that is not as readily apparent when formal considerations are restricted to, or even prioritize, harmony.",
