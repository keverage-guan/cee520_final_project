Those who have been \nintellectually and musically formed by Schenkerian ideas have likely not \nwelcomed this development, since the views of Schenker on Riemann—the great Un-Ohr —were strong and unambiguous. Indeed, the relegation of Riemann’s \ntheoretical ideas to risible futility was a kind of recreational activity among \nardent Schenkerians. Oswald Jonas, for example, after arguing for the \nuselessness of function theory and noting that “such harmonic hearing and \ninterpretation can even surpass a manner of composing—although the two are \nobviously interdependent,” cites a passage from a string quartet by Max Reger—the \ngreat Gegenbeispieler —analyzed in the Riemannian way. “Need anything \nfurther be added?,” he sarcases in the following, one-sentence paragraph.

Before that calamity, Americans seeking advanced training \nin composition (and, therefore, theory) generally sought it in Germany (e.g., MacDowell, Chadwick) and brought back German methods of instruction. As \nRiemannian ideas began to be widely adopted in Germany in the years before the \nwar, they started to show up on these shores (e.g., Dirk Haagman’s Tonal \nFunction: Harmony, Scales, and Intervals, the first volume of which was \npublished in 1916). (2) But the war exposed North Americans to powerful \nanti-German propaganda of a then unprecedented force: not only was sauerkraut \nrestyled as “liberty cabbage” and the city of Berlin, Ontario, renamed Kitchener \nover the objections of its inhabitants, but all things German were subject to \npatriotic disapproval, leading even to the public abuse of German-speaking \nimmigrants and their descendents. After such a dose of cultural vitriol, it is \nhardly surprising that the second volume of Haagman’s book never appeared, that \nCopland, Piston, and other post-war composers journeyed to France instead of \nGermany, and that Riemann’s ideas gained no new advocates on this side of the \nAtlantic.",

Rehding’s book does for Riemann \nvery much what Thomas Christensen’s did for Rameau, providing intellectual \ncontext and even re-animation for a figure whose achievements have long since \nbeen sorted and absorbed by the discipline. Moreover, not only is context \nprovided, but also a sense of the flawed human being within the context, a more \nsympathetic and intriguing figure than that of the impersonal agent of \nIntellectual History. Both Riemann and Rameau, in their respective authors’ \nhands, are captured in informal poses—their theories unbuttoned and ideas \nuncombed. These pictures are skillfully extracted as the underpainting of the \nformal self-portraits offered in these thinkers’ many writings. \nNineteenth-century standards of living and work having endowed Riemann with a \nlarger canvas, his self-presentation to history has, if less color than \nRameau’s, then more detail—and more flaws. As a result of this difference in \nscale, Rehding maintains a constant focus on his subject, yet he also populates \nhis narrative with an ensemble cast of figures who can assist the reader in \nunderstanding the sources and influences of Riemann’s ideas. In this way is he \nable to make fascinating the ideas, writings, and circumstances of a German \nacademic of the last century, whose chief accomplishments resulted from strongly \nheld yet questionable opinions and an industriousness that we would today call workaholism.

He was listening for undertones, which he believed to exist in the \nsound wave” (15). What he heard that night is a mystery. He claimed to have \nheard “something very distinct.” Were they undertones? Couldn’t be. But whatever \nhe did hear, or claimed he did hear, was proffered as undertones. That others \ncould not replicate his experimental results was unfortunate—for them; maybe \nthey needed a better kind of piano. With such an attitude, Riemann appears to be \nthe stereotypical Mad Scientist tinkering away in his private laboratory. Rehding writes: “The image of Riemann hearing undertones has become a derisory \nemblem of theoretical hermeticism, coupled with a level of wrong-headedness that \nis so much beyond our comprehension that ridiculing the approach seems to be the \nonly way to cope with the sheer absurdity” (17).

As is well known, Riemann wished to found \nthe minor triad on the same acoustical principles as the major; whereas only the \nlatter could be extracted as a subset from the overtone series, the former must \nneeds for Riemann be a subset of the undertone series, which he then endeavored \nto hear on that fateful night. Thus, from a fundamental C 4 emerges both the \nmajor triad C–E–G in the 6th octave and the minor triad C– A ♭ –F in the 0th, like \nso: (see Example 1 ). Both triads being derived from the same fundamental, both should benefit \nequally, Riemann believed, from the usual synecdochic naming practice. That is, \nboth ought to be recognized and named as types of C triads. The major, \nover-chord, Riemann labeled c+, and the minor, under-chord, he labeled -c. And \nfrom this principle of harmonic dualism he famously constructed a new \nlanguage—alphabet and vocabulary—for his beloved Janus-monster. Rehding’s \ncentral theme is to show how important this creature was for Riemann’s entire \nproject, and he succeeds in providing this much-needed corrective to the \nembarrassed impulse to isolate, hide, or otherwise dismiss dualism as just one \nof many Riemannian constructions, botched though it is.",

To be sure, such \nadjectives do indicate a relation among these things, but Riemann, Rehding, and \nothers frequently fail to differentiate among them, so that all things major (or \nall things minor) end up being fundamentally the same, and as a result nouns are \ninterchanged freely in discussion. When Rehding writes that “harmonic dualism is \nthe postulate of theoretical equivalence between major and minor systems” (28), \nis not the correct noun, in light of Dr. Riemann’s nighttime experiments, \n“triads” instead of “systems”? A few pages later, terms have shifted again: \n“harmonic dualism is the attempt to declare the major and minor modes as \nnatural,” and, further down the page, it is a kind of outlook that “seeks to \npresent the minor system as equivalent to the major system” (31).",

(12) About this last phenomenon, Helmholtz writes that “it was not until composers \nventured to put a minor chord at the close of compositions written in the minor \nmode [in the middle of the 18th century], that the musical feeling of European \nmusicians and hearers can be admitted to have become perfectly and surely \nhabituated to the new system” (Helmholtz, 365). This sophisticated argument, \nboth empirical and historical, was the final outcome of Helmholtz’s modal \ninvestigations; having determined that minor was less consistent a system than \nmajor, he then ventured some observations about the artistic consequences. These \nhe would admit as being tentative: “I must request the reader to regard this \nsection [on the history of music] as a mere compilation from secondary sources; \nI have neither time nor preliminary knowledge sufficient for original studies in \nthis difficult field” (Helmholtz, vii).

                "text": "[20] Heinrich Schenker comes immediately to mind as another theorist who claimed \nthis kind of insight, and comparing notes on their respective ideologies is an \ninteresting dialectical exercise. While Schenker identified himself as an \nArtist, Riemann—despite having composed and published over 60 opus numbers \nduring his lifetime (14) —was clearly on the side of Science. For Schenker, the \nlaw of music resided in the tones themselves, and master composers were those \nwho were successful mystic mediums, who brought forth art in their act of \nobedience. Riemann, too, esteemed the master composers as law-abiding paragons, \nyet they were as susceptible to error as any human being, especially so when it \ncame to the notation of their works. For notation was essentially transcription, \na second-order representation that could only imperfectly represent the \nfirst-order idea, which resided in the psyche of a listening composer. On this \npoint, the contrast between Schenker and Riemann can be made even more vivid, \nfor both produced editions of Beethoven piano sonatas founded on their \nrespective positions. Schenker’s edition inaugurated what we today regard as \nexemplary editorial practices, as Carl Schachter explains: [Schenker] was the first consciously to reproduce, as far as it is possible in \nprint, the visual impression of the autograph. In other words he tried to be \nfaithful not only to the contents of the work but also to the form in which the \nautograph presents them to the eye of the viewer. Very often Beethoven writes in \na manner contrary to standard notational practice. Most editors before Schenker \nsimply “corrected” these irregularities without realizing that they were \npossibly blocking access to an understanding of the composition. (Preface to \nDover edition, vol. I, page vi.) Example 2 (click to enlarge) Riemann, from his vantage point, would not only deny that such notational \nidiosyncrasies were access points, but also would maintain that even \nconventional notation blocked access to the contents, which in any case were not \nto be found in the autograph, but in the mind of the listener (with the composer \nbeing the original listener). His mission, when editing works, was to represent \nthe proper relation of the published work to the actual, law-abiding original. \nHis editorial interventions were thus analytic acts, designed to show the \nconformity of the artwork to the laws of phrasing and dynamics. The treatment of \nthe second theme of op. 14, no. 1, first movement perfectly illustrates his \nmethodology (see Example 2 ). The top staves are Riemann’s, and the bottom are Schenker’s. Skipping tedious detail about the analytic meaning of Riemann’s various \narticulation signs, I focus instead on what happens in final two bars. In a \nfootnote, Riemann acknowledges that Beethoven’s original is as Schenker has it, \nbut that the situation involves phrase-motivic overlap—hence, the crossed \nslurs. G ♯ 5 is at once the end of a motive (because it resolves F \ndouble-sharp), and the \nanacrustic beginning of another (the thesis point being the octave below, G ♯ 4 ). \nThis analytic truth, which the ear knows at once, is given a notational \nexistence by means of a “doubled” G ♯ 5 . Why edit this way? Riemann writes: This new method of notation is a running commentary, a detailed thematic \nanalysis of the works. It prevents a defective or faulty conception of the same \nand indicates instead proper expression, doing away with the need for \nreflection. It eases the work of the teacher in an unprecedented way and makes \npossible for one without a teacher to progress without making serious errors. \nIn this way the author offers the beginner an indispensable relief in working \nout phrasing, while offering the advanced player new technical problems to \nsolve.
