In between these \npc references to phrase 1, it connects clearly to phrase 3.

The symmetry thus \ndisplayed, and the musical characteristics of the four phrases, suggest a \nhearing of the work that corresponds roughly to the Tchaikovsky song model \n(Example 12b): piano introduction preceding vocal entry, brief piano postlude \nfollowing vocal cadence. In other words, phrases 1–2 of Lonely Flute introduce \nphrase 3 ff., and phrase F concludes following phrase P. Lonely Flute ’s opening \nemphasis on { D ♭ , F, A ♭ } at phrase boundaries, and its penultimate phrase’s A ♭ – D ♭ “closure” support this interpretation, as does the pacing of pc versus tp \naggregate durations (close to 1:1 ratio at the work’s beginning and ending \nonly).
