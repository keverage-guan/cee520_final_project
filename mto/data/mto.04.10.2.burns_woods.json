    "abstract": "This paper studies alternative artist Tori Amos’s cover versions of two original performances by Billie Holiday and Eminem. The narrative perspectives and musical structures of the original songs offer great potential to explore questions of authenticity, appropriation, and intertextuality, and Amos’s distinctive revisions of the songs encourage reflection on her Signifyin(g) practices. The song “Strange Fruit” marked a shift in Billie Holiday’s musical style and social consciousness. Her recording (1939) of this emotionally powerful song about the lynching of a black man is upheld as the benchmark (“authentic”) version of that song. Over five decades later (1994), Tori Amos expresses a powerful commitment to the style and social message of Holiday’s original, yet her musical presentation is not merely historical tribute; rather, Amos Signifies on the older text to offer a contemporary statement on race and violence. Eminem’s song, “‘97 Bonnie and Clyde” (1999) exposes the problematic theme of violence against women. In her version (2001), Tori Amos appropriates Eminem’s lyrics, but casts a new perspective over the narrative by assuming the voice of the murdered woman. This paper analyzes the originals and covers using an interpretive framework that focuses on the voice as the site and vehicle of an artist’s Signifyin(g) expression.",

(1) Such an attribution might be an evaluation of the sincerity of the artist, or a judgment concerning purity of musical style. Sometimes an entire genre is evaluated on the basis of its authenticity, for instance, when folk is associated with the authentic and pop with the synthetic. The concept of “authenticity” becomes ever more germane when the analyst is considering an artist’s borrowing of another artist’s original material. In a simplistic evaluation of such “cover” songs, the original material might be described as authentic and the cover an appropriation, yet the interpretive process ought never to be that simple.",

(2) Moore recognizes intersections among these three categories, for instance, an appropriation of another artist’s work may still be considered “authentic” as long as the borrowed material is presented with “sincerity.” Such attributions of genuineness, honesty, authenticity, suggest a unified statement, perhaps one could even say single-voiced utterance, which by definition does not admit of contradiction, irony, sarcasm.",

Richard Middleton understands intertextuality in the context of popular music such that “all texts make sense only through their relationships, explicit or implicit, with other texts.” (3) Although Middleton does not invoke the term “authenticity,” its value seems implicit when, for instance, in his analysis of a Miles Davis remix, he concludes that Davis emerges as more of an auteur in the remix. (4) Again in his analysis of a remixed Bob Marley song, Middleton asserts that the producer makes the music “sound more like itself,” whereupon he wonders “how this musical ‘self’ is being conceived and where it is located.” (5)",

(7) Henry Louis Gates explains that the rhetorical devices themselves, the play of language, the manipulation of meaning, are the essence of Signifyin(g). The Signifyin(g) subject is referred to as the trickster, a master of technique, and the fascination with the expression is not that s/he signifies something, but that s/he “signifies in some way. ” (8) A natural corollary of this privileging of process over literal content would be the privileging of subject, the Signifier, over the signified.

                "text": "[7] Before we turn to our analytic examples, we would like to reflect on the music-theoretical enterprise of analyzing an artist’s vocal expressive practices. Since the music we have chosen for study is vocal music, with strong lyrical content, our primary analytic emphasis will be on the voice as signifier. We have developed an analytic approach that gives consideration to the space that the voice occupies, the perspectives that an artist’s voice might adopt in the different contexts that comprise a song, as well as the locality of the voice within the domains of text and music. The strategies for the socio-musical communication of popular song derive from nuances of vocal expression in relation to text delivery, including the gamut of expression founded in vocal quality, range, and production, to text pronunciation and articulation, to the manipulation of musical gestures and structures. The following are our four categories for the interpretation of the voice as the site and vehicle of a Signifyin(g) expression. Voice as Subject in the Lyrical Narrative. The voice is situated as \n  the speaking subject for the lyrics, adopting a particular narrative \n  perspective. The singer might adopt the role of narrator (a third-person \n  voice), or the role of a character (a first-person subject) in the lyrical \n  narrative. (9) The subject is not necessarily fixed in a song performance—an \n  artist’s voice may switch from one character’s subjective position to another, \n  adopting more than one voice in the course of the song. Neither is the subject \n  determined by the lyrical content alone, but rather is developed by the \n  musical artist. That is, one artist might adopt a character stance for a given \n  song, while another artist could assume a different voice in the story. The \n  subjective position is a level of meaning for the listener to understand, \n  based on that artist’s ability to adopt that voice, that is, to communicate a \n  social stance, through the use of dramatic and musical techniques. Voice as the Vehicle of Social Communication. The subject or character in a popular song narrative might communicate a social message, describe a situation, express an emotion. The lyrical narrative, with its potential for social affect and emotion, is transmitted by and through the vocal effects. Some of these effects might be considered to lie in the domain of dramatic presentation, achieved through pronunciation, accent, emphasis, as these are part of a system of socio-linguistic conventions. However, just as the subject of a song is not fixed, the social message of a song is open to interpretation. An artist uses such linguistic conventions to shape the meaning of the song, enhancing concepts or offering contradictory meanings. Voice as Participant in the Musical Codes, Conventions, Styles. A singer presents the lyrics in the context of the musical content, in which we find in operation the connotations of style and gesture that are part of a long history of musical codes and conventions. Conventional meanings and style connotations contribute to the context-based musical framework for the song. The voice has an important role in the structure of form, phrase, rhythm, melody, harmony and texture, and will participate in that musical design and structure in a variety of ways, sometimes strongly directing the formal structure, and sometimes being relegated to an incidental role in that structure. Since popular music is a performance-based musical art, an artist can choose to manipulate content to greater or lesser degrees. Rhythmic, melodic, and phrase content are subject to change and variation, leading to potential Signifyin(g) practices in those domains. For instance, the singer could replace the tonal convention of dissonance resolution with an avoidance of closure, indicating a deviation from the norm. Voice as Member of the Instrumental Ensemble. The singing voice participates in an active musical texture that features not only instruments but also, for recorded popular music, the production techniques that affect the sound. The musical content and structure of the song (form, harmony, melody, and rhythm, etc.) are transmitted or enacted through the instrumental ensemble. The voice presents itself in dialogue with the instruments, revealing a variety of musical relationships, the interplay of musical ideas conveying meaning that can be related to the socio-lyrical content.",

Although these concepts may seem to exist only at a music-critical level, we present concrete music-theoretical techniques that bring musical content, structure, and design into the argument. We study here two recordings by Tori Amos of songs originally recorded by Billie Holiday and Eminem. Amos is well known not only for her original song compositions but also for her performance of cover songs. In addition to the Strange Little Girls album, which is a collection of covers, Amos has released many “singles” that feature remixes and covers. Some of her most famous covers appear on the Crucify EP (1992) where Amos reinterprets Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” “Angie” by the Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin’s “Thank You.” The two Amos covers that we have chosen for this study are interesting for their thematic handling of race and violence within a particular social context. These songs take us from New York in 1939 to Detroit in 1999. “Strange Fruit” (Lori Burns)",

The producer from her early recording period, John Hammond, captured the essence of this transitional moment of both acclaim and criticism with the following remarks:  “The beginning of the end for Billie was ‘Strange Fruit,’ when she had become the darling of the left-wing intellectuals . . . I think she began taking herself seriously, and thinking of herself as very important.” (10) The political context and powerful social content of the song held very real consequences for Holiday—for instance, although she had a recording contract with Columbia, they refused to record “Strange Fruit.” Columbia did, however, release her to record it for Milt Gabler at Commodore in April of 1939.

In The Power of Black Music, Samuel Floyd writes, “Cultural memory, obviously a subjective concept, seems to be connected with cultural forms—in the present case, music, where the ‘memory’ drives the music, and the music drives memory.” (15) In Race Music, Guthrie Ramsey writes about music as a means of accessing cultural memories, the access made possible because “cultural forms such as tales, stories, and music (especially the performative aspects of such) function as reservoirs in which cultural memories reside.” (16)",

Such an act of transfer is “an act in the present by which individuals and groups constitute their identities by recalling a shared past on the basis of common and therefore often contested norms, conventions, and practices.” (17) Since we may not have access to the original experience the transmission of history and cultural memory is considered by scholar James Young as “twice-behaved behavior.” (18) This conception of historical and cultural transmission resonates with the feminist belief that history is constructed and contested. Feminists tell us not to forget or suppress the past, but rather that we must contest such suppression with an “active remembering.”",

Lewis Allan’s song lyrics use the metaphors of fruit and nature to represent the hanging body in the tree, thus couching the horrible image in poetic terms. A transcription of the original melody, Holiday’s vocal line, and Amos’s vocal line for verse 1 are aligned in Example 1 . (19) In lines 1 and 2 of verse 1, Holiday brings to the fore the words that describe a natural scene: trees, fruit, leaves, root. She ascribes to these words longer rhythmic values, directing the rhythmic flow to these words as anchors. In particular we notice this in line 2 where twice the expression “blood on the . . . ” is passed over very quickly, thus de-emphasizing the word string that carries the human or social implications of the story. In line 3 Holiday draws out the words “swingin’” and “southern,” taking us a step closer to that human story; that is, these words suggest social contexts, whereas the emphasized words in lines 1 and 2 represent nature. Holiday’s emphasis on the nature words is achieved by durational values, but now in line 3 the emphasis comes through melodic elaboration and swung rhythms, clearly distinguishing the words “swingin’” and “southern” as carrying a particular musical style connotation. The final line 4 of the verse is offered as a direct communication of the lyrical statement. In both rhythmic and melodic presentation, this line is delivered with a straight feeling and a sense of resignation. “Hangin’” arrives with a relatively strong emphasis on beat 3. (It is important to note that these gestures in the Holiday version are not found in the sheet music. I will offer some comparative remarks between the original and Holiday’s version presently.)",

One writing strategy that she explores is the understatement of atrocity as an important means of retaining an audience. Morrison states: “ . . . it was extremely important for the writers of these narratives to appear as objective as possible—not to offend the reader by being too angry . . . ” (20) Morrison identifies her task in analyzing these texts as follows:  “My job becomes how to rip that veil drawn over ‘proceedings too terrible to relate.’” (21) Morrison’s analysis illuminates the subject’s perspective, revealing a self-consciousness over the trauma that has been experienced, and a desire to express the history of the trauma in objective terms, in forms that control and contain the content.",

A voice-leading analysis tells us even more about the weight of those words: trees arrives on the tonic, B ♭ , fruit on C as the neighboring scale degree 2 ˆ , and then those pitches repeated for leaves and root. In the original song, the melody consists almost solely of this 1 ˆ - 2 ˆ - 1 ˆ - 2 ˆ movement. There is one ornamental pitch, the third scale degree, heard over the dominant, at the verb “bear.” When Holiday elaborates the melody, she takes that ornamental scale degree 3 ˆ and extends it even higher to scale degree 4 ˆ , the E ♭ . The verb “bear” is particularly poignant when we know the ultimate meaning of the song (tree bearing fruit becomes tree dropping dead fruit). This verb is presented on the active contrapuntal scale degree 4 ˆ ( E ♭ ), stepping down on the word “strange” to the scale degree 3 ˆ and then 2 ˆ , the goal of the melodic motion. “Strange” is also given an unusual rhythmic setting, arriving on a very weak second half of beat 2, but then being held over as the first part of a swung triplet rhythm. My interpretive point here is that the words that emerge most prominently in the lyrical emphasis and musical structure of the song—trees and fruit—are in fact enhanced by the more active and poignant words even though these active moments are fleeting and always brought back into containment by the strong structural arrivals.",

The ♭ 6 ˆ settles to scale degree 5 ˆ on the word “breeze.” Holiday heightens the musical expression in this meaningful phrase. Her rhythmic articulation is one means, but melodically her line is noteworthy because of the way in which she exceeds the structure of the original melody, going one pitch beyond the neighbor note that was ♭ 6 ˆ , rising up to a ♭ 7 ˆ before settling back to 5 ˆ . The effect of this G ♭ - A ♭ - F is to dissipate the impact of the ♭ 6 ˆ neighbor to 5 ˆ and its resolution. The expectations that a listener might conventionally feel for a G ♭ - F resolution, are suspended once the higher note A ♭ enters the dissonant field. From that ♭ 7 ˆ , Holiday simply falls back to the scale degree 5 ˆ , interestingly enough, one that is supported in the bass by a leading tone, a cross relation with the ♭ 7 ˆ in the melody.

The sense of rigidity or containment is further enhanced in line 4 by the contrapuntal relationship between bass and voice—they are in octaves, a rather unusual presentation, and one that contributes to this sense of containment or control. \nThe first verse establishes this struggle between strict and free, nature and humanity. That struggle is certainly the essence of the song’s lyrical and musical narrative. Based on Morrison’s discussion of cultural trauma and memory, the struggle to control one’s presentation of an extreme human tragedy was an important aspect of the African-American slave narrative.

Holiday saved her most poignant gesture for the second half of line 3 (“for the trees to drop”), but Amos reaches that emotional height already at the end of line 2 (“for the wind to suck”). Amos’s premature climb to the peak of the melody requires her to sustain that climax for a longer period of musical time than Holiday. Holiday’s excursion was brief, checked under control immediately, a tempered outburst. Amos allows herself to linger in her outcry. Her actual melodic embellishments can be seen to derive directly from Holiday’s line, but with a greater degree of repetition and resulting emphasis on dissonance (the ♯ 4 ˆ neighbor to 5 ˆ , the ♭ 6 ˆ and ♭ 7 ˆ gestures, and the chromatic slide from ♭ 7 ˆ to 5 ˆ ). Whereas Holiday offered a fairly conventional presentation of the final melodic line, Amos’s final rising glissando from the expected scale degree 5 ˆ to a sharp ♯ 4 ˆ is a remarkably unconventional gesture.",

The original song reveals the narrative of nature versus humanity, of restraint versus emotional response, of musical control versus containment. Holiday and Amos did not compose the song. They do compose, however, their own “authentic” versions of the song, that is, they Signify on the song, claiming it as their own, and transmitting its meaning to an audience. Based on the vocal Signifyin(g) practices that I have analyzed, I would categorize Holiday’s performance as that of a witness to the social scene, as someone historically connected to the context of the story, as revealed through strategies that are culturally prescribed (restraint in the telling of tragedy). I would categorize Amos’s version as an active remembering of a historical story by someone who carries cultural traumas from other contexts. Not being a witness on the scene, not being held to a standard of restraint, she takes greater liberties in declaring her outrage. “‘97 Bonnie and Clyde” (Alyssa Woods)",

The song that I will study here, “‘97 Bonnie and Clyde,” is from The Slim Shady LP . (23) Alter-ego Slim Shady emerges as a character through which Eminem is able to express social commentary in a first-person narrative that does not necessarily reflect his own personal views or actions. He uses the Slim Shady character to shock people by presenting them with views that most artists would or could not express. This alter-ego allows Eminem to be detached from the strong social issues that he expresses in his music. He says, “Slim Shady is just the evil thoughts that come into my head, the things I shouldn’t be thinking about . . . people should be able to determine when I am messing around.” (24) Eminem has a wide fan base, but receives a lot of negative media attention due to the offensive nature of his lyrics, which have been accused of encouraging hate crimes.",

Eminem’s song is loosely based on the Bill Withers and Grover Washington Jr. song “Just the Two of Us” (1980). (25) In Eminem’s song, “just the two of us” refers to “just me and my daughter,” the two who remain once the mother has been murdered. In the introduction we hear the narrator’s statements of love and affection for his daughter as well as his strong desire to be with her (“Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me”). The first verse takes place as the narrator drives to the beach with his daughter. The listener begins to discover details of the murder as the narrator explains this late night trip to the beach to his daughter. The chorus consists of eight repetitions of the phrase, “Just the two of us,” the most obvious reference to the Withers/Washington original. In the second verse the narrator reveals more details of the crime as he attempts to explain the situation to his daughter in terms she might understand. After a second repetition of the chorus, the third verse describes the arrival at the beach and the disposal of the body in the water. After a final repetition of the chorus, the narrator once again declares his love for his daughter and reiterates that nobody will ever keep them apart.",

That is, by bringing an innocent child into the scene and act of violence, Eminem intensifies the implications of that domestic violence. If we consider the Voice as Subject in the Lyrical Narrative, Eminem adopts the role of the criminal father, but also raises our awareness of and gives a realistic presence to the daughter whose life will be forever affected by the crime.",

That is, his invocation of a different voice and subjective perspective permits him to disown the violent act, and instead to comment upon it as a social critic might.

His Signifyin(g) on that story is presented through the medium of the genre of inner-city Detroit rap music, a genre that connotes the social contexts of race, poverty, violence, and hardship.

Sometimes emphasis is achieved by means of a colder tone.

Eminem’s text delivery is constructed to fit with these 4-bar phrases but Amos manipulates her delivery of the text to offset the lines with the beginnings and ends of phrases.",

                "text": "[61] The beginning of verse 2 is the first moment of phrase agreement between the strings and the voice. This synchronicity creates a momentary sense of regularity in the structuring of the song, but is not permitted to last. Amos disrupts the flow when she emphasizes the words “real, real, mad” to stretch out her line delivery. The phrases then remain out of sync for the remainder of the verse. Verse 3 begins with the voice and string phrases coinciding, but the phrasing is once again disrupted, this time signaling the textual climax of the song. When the body is thrown into the water, the line “one, two, three” is delivered over a longer span of time, suspending the phrase timing. As in verse 2, the vocal and string phrases then remain asynchronous for the remainder of the verse.",

This disruption draws attention to the lyrics, which I interpreted earlier as a moment of painful reflection for the murder victim.",

                "text": "[63] Amos’s desire to give voice to the victim is most clearly expressed in the chorus, the only part of the song that is given melodic phrasing for Amos to sing. It is also significant that the persistent, repeated string motive of the verse is replaced by a more melodic theme. These melodic elements create a considerable change in affect for the chorus, in which the mother laments the loss of her life with her daughter. Here I would argue that the chorus text “Just the two of us” is suggestive of the mother and daughter pairing as well as father and daughter. All of these elements contribute to a reading of the chorus as the mother’s expression of sorrow.",

                "text": "[64] The interpretive concept of intertextuality is useful as we reflect on the song lyrics and music of “‘97 Bonnie and Clyde.” As with Eminem’s original, Amos’s version invokes multiple voices within this song text: that of victim, child, perpetrator of violence, as well as social commentator. In addition, since this text was created in response to Eminem’s original, his voice as social commentator is also inherently present—as Amos adopts her own voice, as she Signifies on this text, we carry the cultural and musical memories of his voice as it was heard in the original song. As we remember his version, we hear in Amos’s version musical idioms and stylistic references that jog other cultural and musical memories. Although a singer-songwriter who usually accompanies herself at the piano, she crosses over, by means of the string ostinato, into a musical style with classical and possibly minimalist stylistic connotations. As she lifts the story out of its original rap context, she does not simply situate it within her own musical style context, but rather transcends the specificity of those stylistic connotations through the reference to a classical or minimalist genre.

These songs are performed by artists whose unique fingerprints are clearly stamped on their artistic statements, who convey powerful and “authentic” subjective positions, and who succeed in transmitting messages that evoke cultural memories. Amos binds these performances together, as the artist who “appropriates” such material, adapting it to her own subjective perspectives. Amos communicates a strong commitment to the musical expression and social messages of the original artists, yet her musical presentations are not merely historical tributes. Rather, she Signifies on the earlier texts, appropriating them to develop new perspectives, raising her own authentic voice to comment on gender, race and violence.",
