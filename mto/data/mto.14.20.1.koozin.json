With the capacity to make articles and critical commentaries widely available in a short amount of time, MTO has attracted writers interested in articulating new methodologies, forging new interdisciplinary connections, and reevaluating our evolving identity as a scholarly society. Changes from fixed texts to multimedia and interactivity have evolved together with shifts in values and ideology. Examples 1a-f provide a sampling of article views representative of MTO ’s evolving design. A broadening in musical repertoires and analytical approaches has paralleled developments in digital media design, fostered by the flexibility MTO offers as an open-access medium for publication authored and produced by scholars. In this brief retrospective view spanning the history of MTO , it is inevitable that I will barely scratch the surface in commenting on a few articles while leaving other important contributions unmentioned. For this, I apologize in advance. Web Environments, Musical Worlds, and the “Silence of the Frames”",

                "text": "[2] Several of the most prolific MTO authors have written thoughtfully on the changing landscape of music theory as it relates to other disciplines. Janet Schmalfeldt’s six articles in MTO published between 1998 and 2010 ( 1998 , 2004 , 2005 , 2010a , 2010b , 2010c ) articulate a growing awareness of how musical analysis can be informed by performance and enriched through consideration of broader cultural and historical contexts. Patrick McCreless, in five articles spanning 1996 to 2011 ( 1996a , 1996b , 1998 , 2000 , 2011 ), traces how our Society grappled with the New Musicology critique in the late 1990s and continued to evolve in relation to other musical and scholarly communities. A wide range of studies in musical meaning can be traced from phenomenological approaches ( Covach 1994 , Littlefield 1996 ) and critical theory ( Killam 1994 , Krims 1994 ) to cognitive theory ( London 1993 , Zbikowski 1995 ) and semiotic approaches ( Agawu 1996 , Roeder 1993 , Monelle 2000 ). The first writers for MTO formulated positions on future directions for music theory and recognized MTO as a logical platform for articulating those positions. These early articles were rich in philosophical introspection. Interestingly, MTO writers were directly concerned with syntactic, semantic, and intertextual issues in music often described through words that would also come to be understood as the stuff of HTML web design: network, frame, code, text, image. Engaged in the substance of their discussions, they did not always exhibit self-awareness as creators of the newly emerging phenomenon of hypertext. But now, the body of work from the early years of MTO forms a powerful example of evolving web-based scholarship.",

In his 1996 article, “ Analyzing Music Under the New Musicological Regime ,” Kofi Agawu explored connections and mutual compatibilities in theory and musicology, citing examples from a vast range of innovative music-theoretical inquiries already under way that could not be dismissed as a merely formalist enterprise. Agawu defended our close readings of musical works with Adorno’s statement that analysis is “the prerequisite for an adequate performance” and aesthetic theories on music are “inconceivable without analysis.” (1)",

Earlier MTO articles provided philosophical grounding for this work through inquiries into how we frame musical experience and knowledge in general. Thoughtful early writings that formulated understandings of the interior virtual world of the musical imagination included John Covach’s “ Destructuring Cartesian Dualism in Musical Analysis ” ( 1994 ). Covach posits that musical understanding arises when we are able to situate a particular piece within a musical world, and musical meaning arises as we appreciate the particular way in which the work is situated. The transparent background that constitutes a musical world is further illuminated in Richard Littlefield’s article “ The Silence of the Frames ” ( 1996 ). Littlefield draws from Immanuel Kant and Jacques Derrida in questioning how art is contextualized such that it appears as a “work.” In his nuanced reading of Edward T. Cone’s ( 1968 ) Musical Form and Musical Performance, Littlefield engages with issues of aesthetic framing. The frame enshrines the work, but ideally, a good frame seems to disappear. As Derrida states, “There is framing, but the frame does not exist.” (2) Musical framing by silence implies the mental act of comprehension, in separating an inner musical world from all externals. Implied in this is the idea that all music analysis taps into a romantic idealized world of vicarious identification with the artist.",

(3) The capacity to focus on specific performances through study of audio and video has been invaluable in MTO studies devoted to analysis and performance, popular music, and film music. Graphic renderings and animation have been integrated in approaches to visualization of musical processes, notably in transformational theory and in studies of rhythm. Following after the incorporation of MIDI audio files in 1996 and RealAudio files in 1998, it became possible to integrate audio and video with graphics and text in a more unified design by the early 2000s. Writers were drawn to MTO as a medium in which they could discuss specific audio and video excerpts. In articles including Mark Butler’s study of electronic dance music ( 2001 ), Rebecca Leydon’s “Towards a Typology of Minimalist Tropes” ( 2002 ), and Elizabeth Sayrs’s study of music in the Western film, The Hanging Tree ( 2003 ), the audio/video element is essential as an object of analysis. Also from this period is Diane Urista’s pedagogy article employing video to illustrate kinesthetic approaches to music theory pedagogy ( 2003 ).",

John Roeder and company provided a whole volume with animated transformational modeling in 2009 . In this special volume, titled “Animating the ‘Inside,’” David Lewin’s advocacy of a “transformational attitude”—a compelling metaphor by which a listener imagines being “inside” the music—is offered as a context for the authors’ representations of musical transformations spanning whole musical works, modeled as animated real-time changes within virtual spaces.

This work would be relevant in addressing the need, articulated by David Neumeyer in the first MTO article, to promote greater inclusiveness and challenge a prevailing “ideology of masterwork culture” (1993, [19]). Two songs by Dolly Parton are discussed in Rosemary Killam’s ( 1994 ) explication of feminist theories, also published in MTO ’s first volume of issues. In noting this, I am reminded of how MTO has been at the forefront in publishing influential articles on the analysis of popular music. As Peter Kaminsky observed in 2000 , the “boomers” were having their revenge and a string of highly influential MTO articles on analysis of popular music followed. To mention several, Walter Everett ( 2004 ), Allen Moore ( 2005 ), Lori Burns ( 2005 ), and Matthew Butterfield ( 2006 ) published foundational studies focusing, respectively, on harmony, text setting, vocal expression, and rhythmic timing in popular music. I would also mention the 2010 “Africa and Beyond” (Volume 16.4) issue and the 2012 Festschrift dedicated to Steve Larson (Volume 18.3) as noteworthy volumes of exceptional breadth, with wide-ranging explorations of varied repertoires including Non-Western music and jazz.",

The mentoring role of editorial board members, who have anonymously provided encouragement and critical feedback cannot be overstated. I also wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of Managing Editor, Brent Yorgason.

We are drawn to technological tools that aid in communicating our close involvement with musical works and musical processes. Digital media extends our creativity in rendering visible our inner virtual worlds of musical experience, while also shaping pathways we navigate in our inquiry. As Judith Lochhead observed in MTO in 1998 , quoting from Heidegger, “technology, in essence, reveals a world in a certain way.” (5) Through a dynamic collaboration of authorship, editorial mentoring, and technical design, MTO has provided a powerful platform for the creative framing of ideas that continues to evolve.",
