Calculate the average of RMS amplitude values in the full mix.

First, de Clercq quantifies  prominence with LUFS because it better captures the perceptual experience of loudness than average RMS Amplitude. Second, his methodology relies on different types of tracks than mine to determine prominence. My approach compares the isolated vocal track to the full mix and expresses the prominence of the vocals as a percentage. The resulting value represents the proportion of the full track’s average RMS Amplitude that is occupied by the vocals. de Clercq’s compares the isolated vocal track with an instrumental track that contains no vocals and expresses the prominence of the vocals in LU. The resulting value represents the difference between the loudness of the vocals and the loudness of the rest of the mix. It is important to note that de Clercq’s suggested method slightly shifts the original definition of prominence by measuring the extent to which the vocals are louder or softer than the other combined remaining sound sources in the mix. His method also implicitly suggests that the x axis be graduated according to LU in visual representations of the virtual space.",

Instead of manipulating a high amount of datapoints to calculate the average RMS amplitude of two tracks, an analyst simply needs to subtract two LUFS values. His workflow adheres to the intent of my methodology by relying on user-friendly tools that do not require extensive training in audio feature analysis. (2) As de Clercq writes in paragraph 4.14, moreover, his method can be used to measure the prominence of other sound sources in a recording. This approach to prominence therefore enables more detailed ventures into the study of virtual space, potentially generating visual representations that encapsulate the placement of all sound sources in a mix.",

I agree that his approach provides a straightforward and intuitive means of quantifying the relative loudness of a voice against the rest of the mix. His contribution also carries the potential to inform further research into the perceptual components of virtual space. I can envision, for instance, an experiment assessing the extent to which listeners perceive minute differences in vocal prominence. Other studies could explore how one’s listening environment and audio equipment impact the perception of prominence and of the other parameters that constitute the virtual space. Such studies could be instrumental in the development of analytical tools that model the way listeners experience popular music.",

For the same reason, I was also unable to replicate his prominence measurements. Ultimately, I show that these discrepancies are not caused by methodological flaws or by calculation errors, but rather by the imperfect state of source separation technologies. Second, I elaborate on the relationship between gender and vocal placement. de Clercq misrepresents my original argument by stating that I attribute differences in vocal placement to gender. The 2022 article made the opposite claim, stating that vocal placement contributes to the formation of a gendered soundscape in musical collaborations. I situate this approach within recent work on the topic, with the goal of generating further discussion on the relationship between gender and spatialization in recorded popular music.

Rather, they arose because de Clercq and I were working from different audio files. de Clercq attempted to replicate my results with isolated vocal tracks generated by Open-Unmix, but my analysis relied on tracks created with iZotope RX7’s Music Rebalance ( Duguay 2022 , [3.8]). Since isolated vocal tracks produced by different software vary from one another, it is natural that our results would differ. My article show two isolated vocal tracks ( Audio Examples 4 and 5 in the original article ) generated from the same recording to illustrate the extent to which different software can generate dissimilar results. In Audio Example 4, which was created with iZotope RX7, non-vocal sound sources bleed into the separated vocal track. In Audio Example 5, which was created with Open-Unmix, the isolated track does not capture all the reverberated images of a voice. The source separation model instead categorizes these vocal components as instrumental parts. In the verse of “Love the Way You Lie (Part II),” Rihanna’s voice is set in a highly reverberant environment. It is likely that our different software simply categorized some of the reverberated images differently, therefore creating more variation in our prominence results.

Although I was able to replicate de Clercq’s results by using a vocal track created by the most recent version of Open-Unmix (rows 1 and 4), the prominence values I obtained for other tracks, while roughly similar, all differ from one another. The lack of replicability observed in both of our methodologies is indicative of a broader issue in the analysis of vocal placement: the imperfect state of source separation technologies. Until models yield consistent, nearly identical results, analysts will be unable to obtain matching prominence results even if they use the same methodology. Fortunately, source separation software is evolving quickly and producing increasingly accurate isolated vocal tracks. For example, when I isolated the vocal tracks for my article, the 2019 initial release of Open-Unmix (which then offered state-of-the-art technology in source separation) still yielded imperfect results. When preparing this response, I was pleased to observe that the newly created isolated files were much more accurate than the ones presented in my article.

The first is to have analysts make their isolated vocal tracks publicly available to ensure replicability. The second is to work to acculturate analysts to expect and account for a reasonable level of variation from one analysis to the other. While the LU values in Example 1 exhibit variability, for instance, they all invite the same observation: Rihanna’s vocals in the first chorus of “Love the Way You Lie” are more prominent, by at least 6 LUs, than the instrumental track that accompanies her. To account for the variations in LUFS that arise when analyzing different isolated or instrumental tracks, analysts could rely on a generally agreed-upon system such as the five-point scale suggested in Example 2 . According to this scale, for instance, all LU values in Example 1 belong to the “Prominence +2” category. The scale assumes that different isolated vocal tracks, while not identical, are similar enough to provide meaningful prominence results. (9) In this sketch of a model, the thresholds between categories remain arbitrary. Obviously, much further work would be needed to determine stricter scale criteria to allow the model to better align with the perceptual experience of prominence. Vocal Placement and Gender",

My 2022 article demonstrates how Rihanna’s and Eminem’s recorded voices are starkly differentiated across their four collaborations: Rihanna’s voice tends to be positioned in a more reverberated, layered, and wide space than Eminem’s voice. As a result, his vocals sound relatively centered and stable in comparison with Rihanna’s more diffuse, mobile vocal placement. I suggest that “these contrasting vocal placements perhaps contribute to the sonic construction of a gender binary, exemplifying one of the ways in which dichotomous conceptions of gender are reinforced through the sound of popular music [4.10].” In his response, de Clercq writes that “it is unclear . . . to what extent the differences in vocal prominence that Duguay identifies can be attributed to gender (as she suggests in [1.7] and [4.10]) as opposed to other factors [5.3].” He explains that other elements, such as musical form, may be the cause of variations in vocal placement.",

It is one of its results. The difference between both claims is schematically summarized in Example 3 . My approach is in dialogue with recent work that explores the formative role of sound in constructing identity ( Eidsheim 2019 , Obadike 2005 , Provenzano 2019 , Reddington 2018 , to only name a few.) As I have proposed elsewhere (2021), we can consider the sound of commercially successful popular music as a gendered soundscape ( Järviluoma, Moisala, and Vilkko 2003 , 99) that defines, reifies, and contests received notions of gender. As Christine Ehrick writes, “Although many of us have been well-trained to look for gender, I consider what it means to listen for it.” Listening for gender in this way, she argues, can shift our attention to “the ways that power, inequality and agency might be expressed in the sonic realm” ( 2015 ).",

                "text": "[16] In the context of popular music, I am especially interested in the politics of gendered soundscapes in musical collaborations, where the case of Rihanna and Eminem proves to be an illustrative example. In every instance that the two artists appear on a track together, they assume a vocal placement configuration that generally presents Rihanna’s voice as ornamental and diffuse and Eminem’s voice as direct and relatable. This differentiation could perhaps be attributed, as de Clercq suggests, to formal conventions, since Rihanna sings all the choruses. Mixing practices for different ranges and vocal delivery styles might also be at play.",

To examine this phenomenon, I previously assembled a corpus containing the 113 songs that featured at least one man and at least one woman on the 2008–18 Billboard Year-end “Hot 100.” Within the corpus, the most common type of collaboration features men rapping and women singing (45 songs). The reverse configuration, in which a woman raps and a man sings, is much rarer (5 songs). Through an analysis of vocal placement, I concluded that, throughout the corpus,\n\n\nIn the soundscape of the corpus—and of chart-topping collaborations between 2008–18—one is more likely hear a collaboration between a man and a woman that is spatialized along the same lines as Rihanna and Eminem. Within this collaboration, the woman is much more likely to perform a repeated chorus, while men advance the narrative through verses. The opposite configuration, heard, for instance, in Justin Bieber’s 2012 hit “Beauty and a Beat,” ft. Nicki Minaj, is far less common.",

CoSoD is a 331-song dataset of all multi-artist collaborations on the 2010–2019 Billboard “Hot 100” year-end charts. The dataset includes Billboard rankings, year, title, collaboration type, gender of artists, and other relevant metadata for each track. We also created analytical files that contain, among other features, vocal placement data on Layering, Environment, and Width. In the same paper, we present an experiment examining the relationship between the gender of a performer and their vocal placement. (10) Our analysis of a subset of the corpus (574 verses and choruses) reveals a statistically significant difference between the ways in which men’s and women’s voices are treated in terms of Width and Environment. Women’s voices are more likely to be set in reverberant environments and occupy a wider space than men’s voices, echoing the trend found in Rihanna’s and Eminem’s collaborations.",

They instead underscore how multiple factors coalesce to sonically differentiate men’s and women’s voices in the popular music soundscape. My goal is to identify these trends and interrogate their broader cultural implications. How, when, and why did musical collaborations settle into this sonic and formal trope? What kinds of gendered stereotypes are reproduced when voices are spatialized according to certain conventions? How is the gender binary reinforced through these aesthetic practices? Could we imagine an alternate 2010s pop soundscape filled with collaborations in which men sing hooks while women rap verses? What might such a gendered soundscape imply? How have certain artists pushed back, been subsumed into, or reinvented gendered sonic trends?  By presenting detailed data on vocal placement, CoSoD also allows for further inquiry into these questions. It also opens the way for further experiment on the way form, vocal delivery style, year of release correlate with gender, vocal placement, and other musical features. One could for instance set up a counter-study that observes vocal placement in collaborations where two men collaborate.",

Thanks to recent improvements in source separation technology and to de Clercq’s more perceptually-relevant workflow, this data could now potentially be added.  For this reason, I am grateful for de Clercq’s modification to my methodology. I anticipate that it will be instrumental to analysts as they continue to study gendered soundscapes and spatialization conventions in recorded popular music.",
