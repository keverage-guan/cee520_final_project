To ensure that different K-nets are related, various authors have proposed that either an interval ( Lewin 1990 and Klumpenhouwer 1991 ) or an inversional relationship ( Stoecker 2002 ) from one K-net to the next must remain invariant. And with all the isographic tools that are available—strong, positive, negative, and axial isography—virtually every trichordal K-net can be isographically related to any other trichordal K-net. This high degree of isographic relatedness is a concern for Michael Buchler. In his critique of K-nets and K-net analyses, Buchler points out that “[s]ince the most promiscuous trichord classes include many of the most common and familiar melodic and harmonic structures found in a wide range of repertoire, trichordal isography generally comes easily to those who seek it. When the standard for pcset relatedness is this low, analysts ought to exercise particular diligence and discretion in making a strong case for the uniqueness and musicality of their readings.” (1)",

Trichordal K-nets that cannot be conventionally and axially isographic are extremely rare in the literature. It is unusual to find two collections that do not share an interval class or an inversional relationship.

Lewin effectively demonstrates how to construct coherent, transformational pathways and introduces K-net recursion.

The augmented triad accompanies the word “Angst” while set-class [016] accompanies the word “Hoffen.” The A4/C5 dyad on the downbeat of the second measure accompanies the word “wechselnd.” Throughout the song, the “Angst” [048] and “Hoffen” [016] sonorities alternate with one another, reflecting the anxious longing for love by the narrator. What makes the opening accompanimental passage so remarkable from a K-net perspective is that these three adjacent collections do not share an interval or an inversional relationship, two requirements to ensure K-net relatedness.

What the figure does not tell us is which [015] is not isographic with which particular [036]. Note that each non-isographic progression listed in the figure has at least one symmetrical trichord; these sonorities contain a limited number of different interval classes, which increases the chances that it will not be isographic with its adjacent sonorities. In addition to the symmetrical set classes, another manifestation of symmetry occurs in Figure 3: the trichordal progressions that are listed in DVLS 0 also appear in DVLS 6; the set-class pairs listed in 1/11 also appear in 5/7, and so on.

Recall that in Figure 2, the [048] “Angst” trichord cannot be isographic with twelve different pitch-class sets from the [016] family. (16) In addition to its intervallic redundancy, all four members of the [048] family feature only even I n labels.

It should come as no surprise that in all the analyses that use trichordal K-nets, the analyst has presented coherent, transformational pathways since K-net relatedness is so common. Still, there is a definite limit to the abundant isographic relations among trichordal K-nets. But what do these isographic holes tell us about the music it models? As Figure 3 illustrates, all non-isographic progressions include at least one trichord that is symmetrically organized. In addition, non-isographic K-nets will always feature three different voice-leading moves, creating a maximally diverse pitch-class counterpoint. Recall that in Schoenberg’s “Angst und Hoffen,” the opening [048] to [016] progression features a variety of different voice-leading lines, and it is not difficult to imagine Schoenberg choosing two trichords that do not share any similarities; for me, Schoenberg’s diverse voice-leading lines appropriately accompany the words fear and hope of the text. So when it finally happens that K-nets cannot be isographically connected, the transformational paths are momentarily thwarted and the voice leading from one trichord to the next is maximally diverse. Rather than search for cues elsewhere to bridge these transformational gaps, I wish to highlight and celebrate those extraordinarily unique moments when our transformational safety (k)-net has been taken away.",
