    "abstract": "This article makes a case for constructing a map of Maurice Ravel’s “La vallée des cloches” (The valley of the bells) by showing how the process of mapping the piece can provide valuable insights from a variety of perspectives, such as: 1) offering insights into how the piece’s many bell sounds are individuated from each other and interact with one another in creating intricate formal and temporal frameworks; 2) emphasizing prominent aspects of Ravel’s aesthetics such as mechanistic impulses, spatial and metaphorical thinking, literary influences, and nostalgic fascination with the past; 3) situating the piece within the context of significant changes in France at the turn of the twentieth century marked by the declining prominence of bells in defining the auditory landscape, the symbolism bells carried with them, and the role bells played in marking temporal rhythms for French society; and 4) showing how many aspects of the piece highlighted throughout the mapping process align in suggestive ways with significant performance considerations.",

To illustrate just how divergent conceptions of “La vallée des cloches” can be in Ravel scholarship, consider in brief the perspectives of Deborah Mawer and Vladimir Jankélévitch. Mawer ( 2000 , 48–50) asserts that the piece exemplifies a tightly controlled, mechanistic manipulation of musical objects that can be found in a number of Ravel’s works; Jankélévitch ( 1959 , 36–37, 88), on the other hand, uses words such as “dreamy,” “misty,” and “vagueness” to argue that the piece epitomizes a sort of “Swiss romanticism.” Selected recordings illustrating a few of the diverse interpretations of this piece among performers will be discussed in the final section of this article.",

A number of scholars, including Carolyn Abbate ( 1999 ), Deborah Mawer ( 2000 ), as well as Daphne Leong and David Korevaar ( 2011 ), have examined certain mechanistic qualities that can be found in Ravel’s music. Some of Ravel’s own essays, such as “Finding Tunes in Factories,” provide evidence of this type of thinking as well (see Orenstein 2003 , 398–400). Serge Gut examines the specific issue of repetition in Ravel’s music in some detail, though his discussion of “La vallée des cloches” is limited to repetitions of single notes, which he acknowledges “occupies only a relatively modest place” in the piece ( 1990 , 32).",

Epitomizing the confounding nature of Miroirs is the piece that closes the suite: “La vallée des cloches” (The valley of the bells). While ostensibly featuring little of the technical virtuosity for which Ravel’s piano works are renowned, “La vallée des cloches” nevertheless presents a number of unique challenges for both performance and analysis. The piece’s many layers of bell sounds produce a highly intricate contrapuntal texture, yet most of the individual strands that create that fabric are strikingly non-developmental. The form of the piece is also quite clearly defined by the recurrence of recognizable musical ideas, yet almost none of those musical ideas can be considered thematic or melodic in any traditional sense. With such perplexing contradictions at its heart, the piece has perhaps unsurprisingly lent itself to widely varying interpretations by scholars and performers alike. (1)",

In this letter, written while on holiday with friends in the Netherlands, Ravel vividly describes an outing that profoundly influenced him. Yesterday, an excursion to Alkmaar: a cheese market with carillons ringing ceaselessly. En route, a most magnificent sight: a lake bordered by windmills, and in the fields, windmills as far as the horizon. No matter where you looked, you saw nothing but revolving vanes. Viewing this mechanical landscape, you could end up believing yourself to be an automaton. With all that, I don’t need to tell you that I’m not doing a thing. But I am storing things up, and I believe that a lot will come out of this trip. ( Orenstein 2003 , 69–70) A lot came out of this trip indeed. Six months later Ravel had completed Miroirs , and in “La vallée des cloches” one can find music suffused with ceaselessly ringing bells whose sounds vividly evoke the notion of such a “mechanical landscape.”",

This proclivity prompted Vladimir Jankélévitch to refer to Ravel as a “master of objects” who “manufactured” musical objects that imitate life ( 1959 , 76). One of the most prominent ways that Ravel imitates actual bell sounds in this piece is through frequent repetition of the individual bell motives, an approach typifying a predilection toward the mechanical that a number of scholars have observed in his music. (2) An important aspect of repetition is that, as Elizabeth Margulis notes, it “tends to reify a passage—to set it apart from the surrounding context as a ‘thing’ to be mused on, abstractly considered, and conceptualized as a unit” ( 2013 , 43). By using repetition, Ravel therefore imbues the bell sounds in this piece with mechanistic qualities, which by extension facilitate their depiction as objects in a physical or spatial environment.",

But by reflection, by some other things” ( Orenstein 2003 , 35). Ravel’s widely acknowledged fascination with the writings of Charles Baudelaire provides further evidence of such metaphorical thinking. (3) Ravel would certainly have known of Baudelaire’s celebrated 1857 poem “Correspondances,” the main idea behind which is a holistic view that the material world suggests more abstract meanings, marking what Barbara Wright calls “a powerful union of the physical and the non-physical” ( 2005 , 33). “La vallée des cloches” thus occupies an interesting position between realism and metaphor. As Alexandra Kieffer asserts, “what is so compelling about this piece is precisely that it presents its listeners with such remarkable and striking moments of apparent realism, only to fold back that realism into further layers of an idealized musicality” ( 2017 , 458).",

Nichols ( 2011 , 11) suggests a longtime attraction in this regard: that after hearing Javanese gamelan music at the Fourth Paris International Exhibition in 1889, Ravel’s music over the ensuing years was “shot through with the resonance of bells, explicit or implicit.” The word resonance is important here, as Ravel felt most intuitively connected to music that was “bathed in sonorous fluid” ( Orenstein 1991 , 126). (4) There are also numerous precedents among earlier French composers for incorporating bell sounds into keyboard music: for example, Ravel’s teacher Gabriel Fauré noted subtle references to bell sounds in the opening of his Nocturne, op. 33, no. 2 (see Nectoux 1991 , 92), and Fauré’s teacher Camille Saint-Saëns composed a number of explicitly bell-influenced works such as Les cloches du soir , op. 85 (see Kieffer 2017 , 447–48). (5) Literary influences may have been another contributing factor: the imagery of bells was a significant theme in Baudelaire’s poetry as well as that of Edgar Allan Poe, whose influence on Ravel has also been widely cited. (6) Finally, Ravel’s evocation of bells in this piece also suggests a symbolic connection to some significant historical and cultural developments in France at the beginning of the twentieth century.

The act of composing such a piece in France in 1905 is not without a certain symbolism as well.

The physical properties of bell sounds were fundamental in the creation of such a landscape, as they served to define an auditory space with readily perceptible limits: an enclosed space circumscribed by the sounds of the bell tower that radiated outward from its center ( Corbin 1998 , 95–97). (7) The omnipresent sounds of bells within nineteenth-century French communities also significantly impacted the social consciousness of those communities. Many French authors of the time, including François-René de Chateaubriand and Victor Hugo, emphasized the power of bell sounds as an expression of rootedness and memory; Corbin notes that “Like the scent of a flower it was a matter of instant recall” (290–92). As such, the absence of these bell sounds could be equally jarring to the psyche. For example, in “La cloche fêlée” (“The cracked bell”) from Les fleurs du mal , Baudelaire deplores the fact that the cracked bell represents a fracture in his soul, which is now unable to access the distant memories evoked by the bell sounds (306). (8) Why might the sounds of bells have been so imprinted upon French people’s memories and why was the thought of their absence treated with such a sense of foreboding? The answer to this question lies in the fact that in France at the turn of the twentieth century, the auditory landscape Corbin describes had begun to disintegrate.",

Locally controlled timekeeping was in fact typical in much of the world for most of the nineteenth century—Stephen Kern ( 2003 , 12) notes that “Around 1870, if a traveler from Washington to San Francisco set his watch in every town he passed through, he would set it over two hundred times.” Sweeping changes were on the horizon, however. In 1884, representatives from twenty-five countries convened at the Prime Meridian Conference in Washington, D.C. At this conference, Greenwich was proposed as the zero-degree meridian, the world was divided into twenty-four time zones, and a fixed, precise method of timekeeping was formulated. Yet, France was slow to adopt such timekeeping standards and “at the dawn of the twentieth century France remained a patchwork of customs and systems of temporal markers” ( Corbin 1998 , 114). Some regions of France during this era had as many as four different times within them, none of which aligned with Greenwich Time. Even when France adopted Paris Time—which was itself nine minutes and twenty-one seconds ahead of Greenwich Time—as a national law in 1891, railroads in Paris actually ran five minutes behind the official time. In a sense, it was (at least initially) a source of local and national pride for France to resist adopting the Greenwich standards ( Kern 2003 , 13). By 1912, however, France had taken the lead in establishing the system of standardized world time, with Paris now at the center of the system’s implementation. The observatory at Paris would take astronomical readings and send them to the Eiffel Tower, which would relay them to eight stations spaced over the globe. At 10 o’clock on the morning of July 1, 1913, the Eiffel Tower sent the first time signal transmitted around the world. The independence of local times began to collapse once the framework of a global electronic network was established. Whatever charm local time might have once had, the world was fated to wake up with buzzers and bells triggered by impulses that traveled around the world with the speed of light. ( Kern 2003 , 14)",

Perhaps not coincidentally, by the beginning of the twentieth century the use of bells in France had begun to decline, and thus the deeply felt meanings with which they were associated began to fade as well. Ironically, the dissolution of the bell-saturated nineteenth-century French auditory landscape did not correspond with a decline in the size of bells or the volume of their sounds; in fact, the reverse was true: Village bells were both louder and of superior quality in 1880 than they had been at the beginning of the July Monarchy [in 1830]. It was rather that their meaning seemed to fall away, modes of attention collapsed, the usages and rhetoric of bells grew narrower so that, in short, a whole range of auditory messages were increasingly disqualified. ( Corbin 1998 , 307) Indeed, the world’s largest swinging bell, “La Savoyarde”—which Ravel told the pianist Henriette Faure was represented in the final chords of “La vallée des cloches” ( Faure 1978 , 77)—was installed at the Sacré-Cœur basilica in Paris in 1895, just as the uses of and meanings of bells in France had begun to enter a state of seemingly irreversible decline. Though France would eventually adopt standardized time, the longstanding significance of bells in the national consciousness helps explain the strength of its initial resistance to the idea.",

In an interesting parallel, Ravel’s student and biographer Alexis Roland-Manuel specifically used the word “nostalgic” to describe “La vallée des cloches” ( 1914 , 16), and in recent Ravel scholarship the notion of nostalgia has also been frequently invoked as a means of describing Ravel’s fascination with the past. (9) Viewed in this light, Ravel’s depiction of an auditory landscape through musical sound in “La vallée des cloches” may be informed by suggestions of nostalgia stemming from the disintegration of this auditory landscape and the potent symbolism surrounding it. Paradoxically, the manner in which Ravel musically depicts this landscape is almost arrestingly novel, as the sounds of the various bells intertwine with each other in elegantly complex counterpoint yet most of the bell sounds are individually repetitive and strikingly non-developmental. “La vallée des cloches” thus presents a fascinating contradiction, or perhaps even coexistence, between memory and innovation: the piece’s bell-saturated auditory landscape conjures up the nostalgic associations of bells in the French collective consciousness, but in order to depict this landscape in such a vividly spatialized way, Ravel had to employ a strikingly novel musical approach.

Bells seem to be the obvious musical objects of choice and, as such, a logical first step in constructing a map of this valley is to determine just how many different bell sounds there are. Doing so presents some interesting challenges, some of which are evident right from the opening measures, as illustrated in Example 1 . In mm. 1–2, there appear to be two distinct bell sounds, one played in each hand. When the chime-like stream of sextuplets enters in m. 3, the issue becomes clarified, however, as the staggered octaves from the first two measures are now grouped together on a single staff and, practically speaking, are now played by a single hand (the left). It turns out that the upper octaves always follow the lower octaves (at a semi-regular time interval), and the tolling parallel fourths that first enter in m. 4 further confirm what the chime-like stream of sextuplets already suggested: that each bell sound that appears in this piece need not be limited to a single pitch or single rhythmic attack. In many cases, the bells are instead represented by musical figures. Importantly, this allows us to conceive of the G ♯ octaves and the “echoes” that invariably follow at one octave above them as a single sound entity, which I call Bell Sound #1 (BS1). The chime-like stream of sextuplets can then be thought of as Bell Sound #2 (BS2) and the tolling perfect fourths can be thought of as Bell Sound #3 (BS3). (10) Example 2 .

(11) Each of the five bell sounds in this opening section is distinguished from the others in a variety of ways—by register, pitch pattern, rhythmic pattern, articulation, and, in some cases, dynamics. Furthermore, the bell sounds are repeated with little or no sense of growth or development, underscoring each individual bell sound’s identity as a distinct entity by imbuing it with a sense of detachment or abstraction from its surroundings (see Mawer 2000 , 48).

Example 3 compares Ravel’s score from mm. 1–4 to a hypothetical version in which the rhythmic pattern of BS1 from mm. 1–2 exactly repeats in mm. 3–4. From this example, we can deduce two reasons why Ravel did not choose to exactly repeat BS1’s rhythmic pattern from mm. 1–2. The first reason is practical: in the hypothetical version, it would become technically unfeasible for the pianist to clearly articulate both the sustained sound of BS1 and the rapid motion of BS2 in one hand. Secondly, in the hypothetical version, BS1 would overlap with the initial entry of BS3 in m. 4. By postponing the repetition of BS1 by one beat in m. 4, as Ravel does, each bell sound can be more clearly individuated. Importantly, therefore, Ravel’s use of repetition is strict enough to establish the different strands as individual bell sounds, yet is flexible enough to ensure that the aural distinction of each bell sound is not compromised.

Eleven of the twelve bell sounds are distinguished as individual sound entities through the use of repetition; the only exception is BS8, an expansively melodic carillon appearing in the middle section of the piece, the character of which Ravel differentiates from the other surrounding bell sounds through the score indication largement chanté (sung broadly).

This formal structure is mainly conveyed through the introduction of new bell sounds and the eventual return of bell sounds heard earlier in the piece. Although section boundaries are generally quite clear, Ravel bridges these divisions by temporarily maintaining at least one bell sound from the previous section every time a new section begins (see Example 5 for an illustration). Importantly, these connections between sections suggest the idea of moving—albeit at a rather deliberate pace—to different locations within the valley: a notion in keeping with Corbin’s argument that bell sounds “conjur[e] up a space that is by its nature slow, prone to conserve what lies within it, and redolent of a world in which walking was the chief mode of locomotion” ( 1998 , 96). As illustrated in Example 5, the introduction in m. 12 of two new bell sounds (BS6 and BS7) coincides with the cessation of BS1, BS2, BS4, and BS5 to mark a clear section change, yet the persistent sound of BS3 across both sections evokes a sense of gradually moving from one area of the valley to another at a slow enough rate that one of the bell sounds from the preceding section can still be heard upon entering the new section. The path taken in progressing from the A section to the B section can therefore be traced through BS3, implying that BS3 acts as a sort of conduit through which the music moves from one location to the next.

(14) He emphasizes that the different benefits that can be derived from figural and formal layouts prompt the analyst to constantly reference the unique characteristics of the piece in question in order to strike an appropriate balance between the two perspectives when positing a space through which the piece metaphorically “moves.” My aforementioned four objectives in turn reflect an attempt to balance figural and formal concerns, and likewise stress a sense of movement through the valley as the piece progresses. The various versions of the maps that I will present in this section also echo Lewin’s assertion that the value of creating a spatial representation of a piece of music lies not necessarily in the end result but rather in the process of creating it.

Example 6 presents a first attempt to map the opening two sections of the piece in this way. Bell Sounds 1–7 are arranged in a circular pattern according to order of entry, which provides a rather convincing way to visualize how the A section of the piece unfolds by capturing both the successive introduction of bell sounds in mm. 1–6 and the sense of then being surrounded by these bell sounds in mm. 6–11. Constructing the map in this way becomes more problematic as the piece moves into the B section, however. The simultaneously occurring bell sounds of mm. 12-13 as well as those of mm. 16–19 are not positioned contiguously, meaning that this chronologically oriented circular map does not conform to Objective 2 (Contiguity). Objective 3 (Connections) is also not met because the map does not emphasize the aforementioned connection between Section A and Section B facilitated by the continuation of BS3. It is therefore necessary at this point to adjust our heretofore figural map to include more formal features as well. Example 7 .

This slight reorientation still convincingly captures the way the music unfolds in mm. 1–11, thus preserving many of the attractive figural features of Example 6. An added benefit of this new layout, however, is that by positioning BS6 and BS7 above BS3, BS4, and BS5, the simultaneous soundings of BS3, BS6, and BS7 in mm. 12–15 as well as that of BS4, BS5, and BS7 in mm. 16–19 are now emphasized by arranging these bell sounds contiguously on the map. Furthermore, the layout of Example 7 now underscores the connection between the A and B sections of the piece by facilitating a sense of movement from one area of the map to another, with BS3 providing a link between the two areas.

In m. 50, following the return of BS1, BS2, and BS3 that marks the beginning of the A′ section, a robust bell sound not originally heard in the A section powerfully announces its presence (recall Ravel’s comment that this is the sound of “La Savoyarde”). This moment may initially seem to mark the appearance of a new bell sound, but a look back to the list in Example 4 indicates that this bell sound has in fact been heard earlier in the piece. Starting in m. 28, in the middle of the C section, the left hand sounds a chord in the low register made up of a perfect fifth stacked on top of a perfect fourth, rolled from bottom to top. While this chord from m. 28 is not articulated with the same force as the “Savoyarde” chord from m. 50, the close similarity between their interval pattern and register—coupled with the fact that these are the only rolled chords in the entire piece—indicates that they should be considered a single bell sound (thus labeled as BS12 in Example 4). Thinking of these rolled chords as different articulations of the same bell sound then helps point out a striking sense of temporal proportion and balance underlying the piece’s formal structure, and furthermore suggests a way to convincingly trace a path by which the valley is traversed as the piece progresses.",

The accented entrance of the A section’s final bell sound—BS5—occurs at the temporal midpoint of the section, thus indicating a precise sense of proportionality and balance underlying the section’s temporal structure. The B section then reveals a similarly balanced temporal design. The B section is 35 quarter-note beats long (with no tempo fluctuations, just like the A section), with a division into two parts that is articulated by another accented entrance of the “insurgent” BS5 which occurs exactly 17.5 quarter notes into the section—once again, at the section’s temporal midpoint. While not all of the piece’s sections can be divided so precisely, the exactly balanced temporal divisions of the A and B sections indicate that creating such a sense of balance played an important role in Ravel’s compositional approach, a strategy that can be further observed in the piece’s overall temporal structure.

The entrance in m. 28 of BS12, which we have now identified as the final bell sound of the piece, comes on the 120th beat—at the piece’s overall temporal midpoint. This precise, equal division in the piece’s overall temporal structure therefore mirrors the temporal divisions observed in the A and B sections. This temporal division also reinforces the piece’s arch-like formal structure, with the entrance of the final bell sound marking the precise moment that, formally speaking, the music starts to turn back and ultimately return to where it started.",

In fact, just the opposite is true; BS12’s location on this map is maximally distant from those bell sounds. When BS12 is so powerfully articulated in m. 50, we are then faced with a literal and figurative disconnection in that BS12 is not positioned contiguously with the other bell sounds from the A′ section. Following the metaphor of traveling through the valley that so fundamentally underlies Objective 1, it would seem impossible to suddenly jump from one location on the map to a far-removed location.

This map underscores the piece’s arch-like formal structure by laying out the bell sounds so that tracing the progression from Section A to B to C to B′ and back to A′ suggests an arch-like shape. Furthermore, the connections between sections are clearly illustrated in that BS3 links Section A with Section B; BS5 then acts as a link between Section B and Section C; the “return trip” to Section B′ then goes through BS10; and BS3 (along with a brief instance of BS6) then acts as a final link between Section B′ and Section A′. Apprehension of the piece’s formal structure as well as all of the connections between sections is accomplished by positioning simultaneously occurring bell sounds contiguously on the map.

At the opening, he tried to get me to play the carillon of double semiquavers in the right hand, and the more settled sound of the high octave bells that punctuate them in the left, on two very distinct levels. And the whole thing had to remain within a pianissimo which he could, in some mysterious way, achieve without it sounding feeble. ( Faure 1978 , 79–80) From Faure’s recollections, which concern the bell sounds identified in this article as BS2 and BS1, respectively, it is clear that Ravel placed a high priority on making the identities of the individual bell sounds aurally distinguishable in performance. Importantly, this corroborates what we were earlier able to deduce from Example 4: that Ravel took care to ensure that each of the individual bell sounds would be both visually and audibly identifiable by clearly distinguishing them from one another in a variety of ways.

Ravel admitted in a letter to M. D. Calvocoressi, however, that he recruited a better pianist than himself for some of the pieces; Orenstein ( 2003 , 219) has identified that pianist as Robert Casadesus. Although the performer on the roll recording of “La vallée des cloches” has not been conclusively identified, Ronald Woodley notes that “the balance of probability favors the composer” ( 2000 , 222), an assertion easily verified by comparing the precision of Casadesus’s 1952 recording of the piece with what Roy Howat ( 2009 , 321) calls “moments of mild anarchy between the hands” on the roll recording, the recording sessions for which took place in 1922. To what cause or causes Ravel’s imprecise performance on the roll recording may be attributed is difficult to determine. In any case, the roll recording points to a significant gap between the precision of Ravel’s compositional approach and the conspicuous lack of precision in his performance of the piece (see Example 10 , and especially note the imprecise counting in mm. 4 and 6).

Finally, Lortie is the pianist who most closely approximates the recommended tempo of 50 bpm in the score, and—similar to Casadesus—maintains a quite steady tempo.

Lortie, on the other hand, primarily distinguishes individual bell sounds by giving each one its own distinct and remarkably constant dynamic level, all the while maintaining resonance though more constant depression of the pedal. All four of the pianists also distinguish individual bell sounds through changes in articulation; this is most evident in the accented attack of BS5. Finally, Rubinstein and Gieseking also take extra time before the onset of BS5, further marking its entrance through the use of rubato.

If this aspect of the piece seems most difficult to convey in performance, an explanation may be found in a fundamental opposition underlying performance and analysis studies stressed by Edward T. Cone ( 1968 , 96–97) and Janet Schmalfeldt ( 1985 , 17–18): that analysis tends toward the synoptic while performance typically favors the immediate. The challenge is therefore that recognition of the balanced temporal divisions in “La vallée des cloches” seems accessible only through synoptic formal analysis, raising the question of just how salient this facet of the music is for performance. In an interview with John Rink, Murray Perahia notes that he initially tries to hear a piece without any preconceptions, and that he considers it a mistake to go too much into details of form before being able to hear the piece in his mind ( Rink 2001 , 10). This should not imply that Perahia sees no use in formal analysis but instead implies that as a performer, he gradually gains awareness of how a piece fits together formally through a bottom-up sort of process. The flutist Elizabeth McNutt ( 2005 , [2]) similarly posits that in learning a piece, a performer “begins essentially without a map,” moving from the specific to the general toward a coherent interpretation. While the kind of map to which she refers is more metaphorical than those presented in this article, her perspective mirrors Perahia’s by suggesting a bottom-up approach in which a synoptic view is only achieved following a lengthy and detailed process of grappling with a piece’s more immediate elements.",

If the precise temporal divisions underlying the piece’s form are in fact possible to project in performance, Casadesus’s recording points to two ways in which such perceptions might be facilitated. Firstly, Casadesus maintains a remarkably constant tempo throughout the piece, thus providing an equivalent basis for comparison among temporal spans. (18) Secondly, his phrasing and dynamic shaping seem to mark the arrival of BS12 at m. 28 (the moment indicated by the mapping process to be the piece’s precise temporal midpoint) as the climax of the piece.",

On the analytical side, the mapping process has offered a number of insights into the ways in which the piece’s various bell sounds are individuated from each other, including the role of repetition in their individuation. The mapping process has also drawn attention to ways the bell sounds interact with one another in the creation of intricate formal designs, which include some highly precise and balanced temporal frameworks.",

                "text": "[40] The mapping process has also highlighted important aspects of Ravel’s aesthetics such as the presence of mechanistic qualities, spatial and metaphorical thinking, literary influences, nostalgic fascination with the past, and the overall prominence of bells in his music. These aesthetic features also suggest an enlightening historical and cultural perspective on the piece: Ravel’s evocation of a mechanical landscape suffused with bell sounds calls attention to significant changes in France at the turn of the twentieth century marked by the declining prominence of bells in defining the French auditory landscape, the symbolism bells carried with them, and the role bells played in marking temporal rhythms for French society as well as for individuals within that society.",

                "text": "[41] Additionally, many aspects of “La vallée des cloches” emphasized throughout the mapping process have been shown to closely align with significant performance considerations such as distinguishing the piece’s bell sounds from one another (and the various ways in which pianists might go about doing so), emphasizing connections between sections of the piece, and ways a performer might conceivably convey the piece’s formal design by means of underscoring its precisely balanced temporal frameworks. Examining how aspects of the piece highlighted by the mapping process align with performance decisions suggests ways in which the mapping and performance processes can relate to one another and offers some reasonable explanations for why such a wide variety of interpretations can be observed in performers’ recordings of the piece. Although “La vallée des cloches” may be considered a confounding piece in many respects, the process of mapping the piece has pointed to some informative, multifaceted new ways of conceiving it.",

                "text": "[42] Might an approach similar to the mapping process presented in this article also be applied to other pieces of music? On one hand, Ravel’s use of repeating, non-developmental layers of bell sounds to evoke a musical landscape was so novel that it seems almost without precedent—one of the only earlier pieces that might be considered a sort of precursor in this respect is “Klokkeklang” (Bell Ringing) from the Lyric Pieces , op. 54 by Edvard Grieg (a composer whose music Ravel greatly admired). On the other hand, some similar approaches to evoking musical landscapes can be posited in later works by other composers—a list that could include pieces such as Charles Ives’s Central Park in the Dark , the “Liturgie de cristal” from Olivier Messiaen’s Quatuor pour la fin du temps , Toru Takemitsu’s Rain Tree Sketch II , and John Luther Adams’s Become Ocean , among others. Significantly, each of the works mentioned above presents thought-provoking challenges for analyzing the music as well as realizing it in performance, and those considerations closely relate in each case to intriguing aesthetic, historical, and cultural contexts. The multifaceted approach to mapping Ravel’s “La vallée des cloches” presented in this article therefore suggests a potentially productive avenue for exploring these and other “landscape” works as well.",
