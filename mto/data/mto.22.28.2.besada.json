    "abstract": "Iannis Xenakis sternly criticized serial music in the mid-fifties. In response, he proposed and developed a set of compositional procedures which were mainly based on probabilistic laws that he framed under the principle of indeterminism. The sieve theory he developed in the sixties represented a return to deterministic strategies for composing. Following examination of Xenakis’ notes and sketches from the period spanning his time auditing Messiaen’s classes to his composition ofNomos Alpha, I argue that sieve theory is better understood when viewed through the lens of his personal earlier speculations on twelve-tone music techniques.",

The choice of different partitions of the octave indeed modify the nature of the pitch sieve, but for a theoretical analysis of a variety and distribution of its disparate intervals, it is a minor issue to remap them onto a new equal temperament. The central matter is that Xenakis used modulo 18 for splitting the octave, and this numerical value shares prime factors with 12, namely 2 and 3. This property is the reason allowing to remap this mathematical sieve onto this particular pitch distribution, because the complex sieves conceived by the composer were always built on elemental sieves with bases 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17 ( Xenakis 1992 , 230–31). All these values are coprime with 2 and 3, therefore also with 12 and 18.

It remained largely influential until at least 1958; John Cage’s arrival at the Darmstadt courses probably marked the end of its centrality ( Iddon 2013 , xi). Some problematic issues associated with serialism had already been targeted by several composers in this decade, mainly concerning its aural comprehensibility. Roberto Gerhard ( 1952 ) for instance, who studied with Arnold Schoenberg in the twenties, acknowledged a gap between the compositional strategies with twelve-tone rows and the listener’s experience. György Ligeti ( 1958 ), a composer situated well outside of the Schoenbergian tradition, provided one of the most authoritative critiques of the serialization of rhythmic figures, arguing that they are perceptually unequal to the manipulations of pitch rows.  Other critiques quickly spread (1) , with one of the most severe objections uttered by Iannis Xenakis ( 1955 ) in his famous article “La crise de la musique sérielle”: Linear polyphony destroys itself by its very complexity; what one hears is in reality nothing but a mass of notes in various registers. The enormous complexity prevents the audience from following the intertwining of the lines and has as its macroscopic effect an irrational and fortuitous dispersion of sounds over the whole extent of the sonic spectrum. There is consequently a contradiction between the polyphonic linear system and the heard result, which is surface or mass (translated in Xenakis 1992 , 8). (2)",

(3) It was at the moment that Dimitris Exarchos ( 2019 ) has described as the beginning of Xenakis’ mid-period style that the Greek composer began to develop his sieve theory. This technical approach, which was first presented within a short essay in the mid-sixties ( Xenakis 1965 ), should be regarded as his most deterministic contribution to music theory and composition. The composer openly addressed the question of determinism in his next technical essay about sieve theory ( Xenakis 1966 ) and mentioned again the issue in the following years (Xenakis 1967 ; 1968 ), but mostly neglected this topic in the two texts on this issue he published significantly later (Xenakis 1988 ; 1990 ).",

(4) This short essay explicitly introduced at least the notion of harnessing probability in composition, an idea that was developed in further theoretical articles (Xenakis 1956 ; 1958 ; 1960 ). The concepts of determinism and indeterminism were first directly addressed in the aforementioned article in 1961, which was reworked for the initial chapter of his first monograph ( Xenakis 1963 , 15–56). In this essay, Xenakis stated that tonal music implies hierarchies in a “deterministic manner” related to “linear processes”; the Second Viennese School faced “the indeterminism of atonality” via twelve-tone rows which were “extremely casual in the strictest sense” ( Xenakis 1992 , 5). The problem arose, in his opinion, from the excessive complexity carried out by composers approaching serial techniques in the fifties (cf., quotation given in [1.1]). For Xenakis, “the strict, deterministic causality which the neo-serialists postulated was lost,” and, “[a]s a result of the impasse of serial music,” he decided to come with “a music constructed from the principle of indeterminism” ( 1992 , 8).

Indeed, Xenakis labeled serialism as a particularly deterministic path mainly because of its underlying “linear arrangement” mentioned above, meaning the preexistence of a fixed order within a twelve-tone row. This categorization is akin to the definition of serial relationships that Milton Babbitt formulated when studying Igor Stravinsky’s late music. Henceforth, I will consider Babbitt’s definition as a theoretical background for the topics under discussion: A serial relation is one which induces on a collection of objects strict, simple ordering; that is, an order relation which is irreflexive, nonsymmetric, transitive, and connected over the collection. The term “serial” designates nothing with regard to the number of elements in the collection, to the relations among these elements, or the operations—if any—applicable to the elements or the relations among them ( 1964 , 39).",

In particular, when explaining some aspects of Nomos Gamma (1967–68), he highlighted the dialectics between the “deterministic and finite machinery” related to algebraic compositional perspectives—a category to which sieve theory belongs—and the “probabilistic and stochastic machineries” he previously conceived ( Xenakis 1992 , 237).",

As Xenakis studied and also occasionally resorted to serial techniques when he was young, it seems reasonable to explore whether these speculations with twelve-tone music may have had an impact—perhaps even an unconscious one—on his return to deterministic concerns.

The largest and most sophisticated accomplishment to emerge from this project was his Procession aux eaux claires (1953), which was conceived as the opening of a triptych under the general title of Anastenaria . Xenakis managed to compose the last part of this triptych, which he entitled Sacrifice (1953), but never delivered the central score.

Among the many musical topics the Greek composer annotated in these notebooks, there are explicit references, dated in October 1953, to Anton Webern’s Drei Lieder op. 18 (1925), Zwei Lieder op. 19 (1926), and the Variationen für Klavier op. 27 (1935–36) ( Barthel-Calvet 2012 , 70). A few days after taking these notes, Xenakis began drafting an unfinished text entitled “Musique sérielle,” in which he pondered five balanced ways to split a twelve-tone row ( Barthel-Calvet 2011 , 5); this was probably inspired by Webernian methods ( Barthel-Calvet 2012 , 51). (11) Just a few months later, in 1954, Xenakis started to plan different compositional strategies for Metastaseis . After time spent struggling with potential twelve-tone rows in another notebook ( Barthel-Calvet 2011 , 6), he finally conceived of serial procedures—albeit sometimes defective ones (in terms of cardinality)—that were aimed at organizing, in different steps, a large central section of Metastaseis beyond its famous glissandi . These compositional strategies mainly focused on the interval relationships within the pitch-class sequences and their permutations, as well as on the connections with their related durations. Xenakis made his method explicit in a self-analysis that remained unpublished until the twenty-first century, when it was fully transcribed by Barthel-Calvet ( 2003 , 162–87). In this text, he coined a number of serial neologisms, and schematized the intervals in a clock shape that somehow began his forthcoming pervasive use of visual diagrams for conceptualizing musical ideas ( Solomos 2021 ). Some of these new concepts and the diagrams for distributing pitch classes were incubated in a document that I will discuss now. Twelve-tone music speculations: The Anastenaria large notebook",

Sketch studies, in general, have been pivotal for shedding light on this aspect of the composer’s career.

Folder 25, found within, houses an almost folio-size notebook with a beautiful Chinese-themed cover on which Xenakis wrote Anastenaria in Greek. He annotated the numbers 1 to 26 on the lower-right corner of the cover and the subsequent front pages. When referencing sheets, I will add the letters  “f” or “b” when necessary to indicate front or back pages, respectively. In addition, a fragment of a sheet of translucent graph paper is kept inside the notebook. Despite the difference in material, it is plausible that Xenakis worked on this sheet at the same time as on the notebook, as its most relevant drawings are clearly connected to the content of the notebook; I will therefore consider the graph paper a constituent element of a common reflective process. Neither the notebook nor the attached sheet is dated. The most likely period for dating the content of folio-size notebook spans from Spring 1953 to the end of that year, probably fitting with its last months. (12) Example 1 .

Schoenberg, and specifically a reference to his Klavierstück op. 33a (1928–29), is previously invoked in one of Xenakis’ early medium-sized notebooks, along with the date May 1952 ( Barthel-Calvet 2012 , 62).

(16) This happy coincidence between Nono’s work and Xenakis’ earlier speculations is not surprising. The row is, in fact, quite trivial in constructive terms. Nono had access to it by reading the theoretical work by Herbert Eimert ( 1950 , 25), (17) who was among the most influential authors for the Darmstadt composers ( Erwin 2020 ). This particular distribution of the chromatic aggregate also circulated in America through the writings of Nicolas Slonimsky ( [1947] 1975 , iii). Both Eimert and Slonimsky referred to this row’s all-interval property, giving credit to Fritz Klein’s Die Maschine (1921). Today, Alban Berg’s row for his Lyrische Suite (1926) is often cited as an example of a dodecaphonic sequence containing all the possible intervals. Berg’s quartet was included in Messiaen’s syllabus in 1952 ( Boivin 1995 , 438), but there is no mention of it in Xenakis’ auditor notes ( Barthel-Calvet 2012 ). Whether he assisted or not at Messiaen’s classes on Berg, it is almost certain that Xenakis was unfamiliar with the notion of all-interval rows. This can be seen in his Anastenaria notebook, from sheet 14 to 15, and from page    22b to sheet 26, where his annotations treat this property as a personal discovery. It is, therefore, unrealistic to believe that Xenakis may have come up with the concept of all-interval rows through the reading of Eimert’s or Slonimsky’ theoretical writings. Later, he made reference to these special rows in his self-analysis of Metastaseis : We can note first that, within the mass of 500 millions of rows, from a diastematic viewpoint, there must be a few ones with a very small number of different intervals. The chromatic scale would be an extreme case with the only interval +1. There is however a limited number of those [rows] that would have only twice the totality of intervals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in absolute value. [ . . .  ] These rows differ from each other only by the arrangement of intervals (Xenakis transcribed by Barthel-Calvet 2003 , 172).",

On page 10f there is a linear representation of pitch classes wherein the integers are related to pitches in the upper section ( Example 4 ). Below, the numeric values are reordered in intervals of perfect fourths. As both orders generate all integers from 0 to 11, this representation puts into evidence how Xenakis found by himself that a cycle of fourths is isomorphic to a chromatic scale. He transferred this idea to circular templates on pages 10f to 11f; these are similar to those previously shown, but represent cyclic perfect fourths and fifths ( Example 5 ). The isomorphism of the cycle of semitones and the one of major sevenths is a basic notion of twelve-tone music, as it matches with the idea of inversion. In turn, the isomorphism with the cycles of perfect fourths and perfect fifths was exploited by Berg, for instance, in his opera Wozzeck (1914–22) ( Perle 1977a ). (19) This procedure was brought to light by Ernst Krenek ( 1937 , 77), and the underlying idea is currently identified in post-tonal music theory with the notion of modular transformation.

Another rejected shape is a division of the circle into 24 parts, as shown on page 17b. Manipulations of the Archimedes spiral are found on sheet 19, but its most accomplished representation is drawn on the translucent graph paper accompanying the notebook ( Example 7 ); the representation is quite akin to Roger Shepard’s pitch helix ( 1965 , 104). On the right of his spiral, Xenakis drew again a clockface diagram and outlined several polygons on both sides of the translucent paper. These forms can be split into an equilateral triangle, a square, and a dodecagram ( Example 8 ).

Starting with Herma (1960–61), Xenakis combined his stochastic methods with a new focus on Boolean algebra. He published an essay in his first French monograph which summarizes the main mathematical features of this piano piece ( Xenakis 1963 , 181–208). In particular, he mentioned that the distribution of pitches in this score depends on three non-disjunct subsets that are playable on a piano; these subsets were “chosen a priori” because of “a characteristic property” ( Xenakis 1992 , 170). The property is not highlighted at all in the essay; however, Xenakis’ archived documents concerning the piece, which are found in folders 17 to 29 of box OM-12, may shed some light on this topic.

The union merges all the pitches from the involved sets, the intersection selects only the pitches which are present in all the starting sets, and the complement of a set is the one gathering all the pitches which do not belong to this former set. The determinism of these Boolean operations does not necessarily imply that their outcome must be aurally perceivable. In this sense, it has been pointed out that Herma could fall under the same criticism that Xenakis enounced against serialism ( Wannamaker 2001 , [5.4]), (21) a remark with which I agree. Further, it is possible that the conceptual contradictions surrounding the inception of this piano piece simply reflect a moment in which its author was struggling to incorporate explicit algebraic elements within his compositional practices—in particular, his efforts to conceptually delimit what he labeled later as an outside-time category ( Exarchos 2019 , 26).",

Prototypic congruences and their standard notation—through the symbol ≡ indicated above—were introduced by Carl Friedrich Gauss at the beginning of the nineteenth century when he established a basis for modular arithmetic. Neither this symbol nor the notion of congruence is traceable, to my knowledge, in Xenakis’ published articles prior to the composition of Herma . By contrast, the notation for modular arithmetic is found in the Anastenaria folio notebook on page 12b, just past the circles with different interval steps and before the discussion of all-interval twelve-tone rows: I admit that there are only 12 different sounds in all the sound spectrum. From a sound, I can find the other 11 ones by adding semitones (≡ unit) and retrieve at the octave (≡ +12 semitones) the initial sound. I can go counterclockwise by subtracting semitones.

(22) His most thorough effort on harnessing algebraic notions for compositional purposes dates from October 1963 to September 1964, when he stayed in Berlin with an artistic grant awarded by the Ford Foundation and the West-Berlin Senate. The birth of his sieve theory can be dated precisely as occurring in this period ( Exarchos 2019 , 33). He presented the most important results stemming from his theoretical speculations with algebra a few years later, in an essay specifically connected to Nomos Alpha (1966) ( Xenakis 1967 ). (23) The analysis in that text demonstrates how he took advantage of non-commutative groups—the rotations of polyhedrons—for conceptualizing the form of his score. The essay also comments on the use of cyclic groups for implementing a sieve of pitches. The intriguing complexity of Xenakis’ essay has surely enhanced the interest that several scholars have shown in this cello piece ( Vandenbogaerde 1968 ; DeLio 1980 ; Vriend 1981 ; Solomos 1997 ; Peck 2003 ).

This technique, applied to pitches, serves for calculating sets generated by a periodic interval—any of these is an elementary sieve—which are subsequently manipulated by means of Boolean operations. In doing so, the resultant sieve is a much more complex pitch reservoir which hides local interval periodicities. The examples below illustrate this fact. Example 9 .

Considering only the pen marks which are aligned on the left of letter B, it is possible to read the A ♯ (la ♯ ) under the first mark, the C ♯ (do ♯ ) under the second, the E (mi) under the third, and so on. Looking carefully, the spatial logic is made clear: the horizontal line on which the pen marks are drawn stands for the register of a standard piano; the location where the horizontal line meets with the left edge of the paper represents the lowest A of the keyboard, with each step of two little squares to the right indicating an ascending semitone. As this logic applies for every horizontal alignment, it is easy to retrieve the name of every marked pitch in this schema. Additionally, the Boolean operations are visually represented. In this example, the notation AB stands for the intersection of sets A and B; the elements of this set are therefore those belonging at the same time to both A and B.",

For instance, 1M12 is the numerical set \\(\\{\\ldots, -23, -11, 1, 13, 25, 37, \\ldots\\}\\), which leads to an octave repetition of D ♭ in different registers, i.e., the pitch-class D ♭ . By similar reasonings, the other elementary sieves are translated into pitch-classes F, G and B; the union of them all is the pitch-class set { D ♭ , F, G, B}. At the lower left, the modular expressions are 1M10, 3M10, 7M10, and 9M10. There is more individual variety per line with modulo 10, which causes the interval of a minor seventh to spread. For instance, if 0 is C4, the values of 1 modulo 10 are \\(\\{\\ldots, -19, -9, 1, 11, 21, 31,\\ldots\\}\\) representing pitches {F2, D ♯ 3, C ♯ 4, B4, A5, G6, . . . }.

Algebraic formulations of some elements of the sieve are expressed this time on the right, but these schemes are unfortunately less meaningful for comparison with the previous images. The reason is that the sieve for the cello piece was used by Xenakis for filtering a nonequal microtonal distribution of pitches, which differs from the distribution of 12 semitones in equal temperament. Sieves are abstract expressions of modular arithmetic that can be remapped onto different partitions of the octave, even those which are not equal ( Xenakis 1992 , 195). I will, therefore, remap some of his sieves for Nomos Alpha , his first piece in which complex sieves were exploited, onto the standard pitch distribution in order to demonstrate his compositional method. Xenakis ( 1992 , 230) labeled the following expression as his “departure function” for the cello score: $$\nL(11,13)=[(\\overline{13_3 \\cup 13_5 \\cup 13_7 \\cup 13_9}) \\cap 11_2] \\cup [(\\overline{11_4 \\cup 11_8}) \\cap 13_9] \\cup 13_0 \\cup 13_1 \\cup 13_6\n$$ Example 12 .

(27) Each one of Xenakis’ sieves is a limited chain of operations over a finite number of elemental congruences, which leads to a trivial consequence: the least common multiple of all the modular bases equals the sum of all the intervals of the cyclical interval succession generated by the whole sieve. In the case of the two sieves from Nomos Alpha , 11 times 13—143—is larger than the number of keys on a piano, a value that hides the cyclicity of the sieve. In particular, a least common multiple other than 12 or any of its divisors entails the emergence of a non-octave repeating reservoir of pitches. Second, the intervals of the array are quite varied and unpredictable in absence of the underlying formulae, although some general trends may be identified, such as small intervals appearing more often than large ones.

With respect to the principle of octave repetition, he did not deeply explore the properties of intervallic patterns for pitch systems wherein this principle fails to apply. (28) With respect to the distribution of intervals, he sometimes summoned different historical scale systems but did not consider at all important features which lead to their interval equilibrium, such as the modern concept of well-formed scales ( Carey and Clampitt 1989 ). (29) I contend that the construction of scales was not truly problematized in Xenakis’ texts, but served rather for introducing his sieve theory through useful examples that may have arisen as byproducts during his attempts to deal with modular arithmetic. The octatonic scale, which matches with Messiaen’s mode 2 and its alternation of tones and semitones, is a good example of problematizing this issue. This scale almost emerged in his Berlin drafts on graph paper when he started to calculate the union of some basic congruences ( Example 14 ). This union can be expressed mathematically as the following assembly of elementary sieves: $$\nS=15_1 \\cup 15_2 \\cup 15_4 \\cup 15_7 \\cup 15_8 \\cup 15_{11} \\cup 15_{13} \\cup 15_{14}\n$$",

It is not a complete mapping of the octatonic scale, as happened in Example 10 with the whole-tone scale, but its content is equivalent to this scale in terms of pitch-class set. A fully unfolded octatonic scale admits a much more simple and compact formulation via sieves, for instance \\(3_0 \\cup 3_1\\). Although there is no explicit mention of Messiaen’s modes in the sheet containing Example 14, Xenakis was aware of the pitch-class content of this sieve, as it is shown in the “minus {C, D ♯ , F ♯ , A}” on the lower margin. I am certainly not implying that this fact went unnoticed for Xenakis, as it is impossible to know this. All that can be said is that he did not give a particular value to it within his handwritten notes, which is an important fact, considering the content of his theoretical writings on sieves. For example, he provided on one occasion a mathematical encoding of Messiaen’s mode 4 through sieves ( Xenakis 1992 , 210). (30) More importantly, this silence about Messiaen’s modes within the Berlin documents seems to argue against an explicit link between Messiaen’s teachings and the struggle with algebra Xenakis formulated once: For me, these modes of limited transposition were modes like others, as any we can build. Only one thing haunted my mind, the fact that he named them “of limited transposition”. [. . . ] After, I told myself, why not inventing too? I reflected a lot about a more theoretical approach [. . . ] based on logic operations and wrote Herma [. . . ]. But I felt that the introduction of probabilities I did was not enough and it was just a first attempt, a deeper dialectic of order and disorder was needed, etc. And I built sound classes for piano, and next [performed] logical operations with these classes. Messiaen used his modes of limited transposition as a coloration above all [. . . ]. A scale may serve however to any feature of sound [. . . ], on condition that these features [. . . ] form an absolutely ordered set (Xenakis, quoted in Boivin 1995 , 366–67).",

It is important to remember here that composers’ a posteriori mental reconstructions of their compositional choices or theoretical reasonings often diverge significantly from their actual practices ( Theureau and Donin 2006 ). My hypothesis is that Xenakis connected his sieves with Messiaen’s modes after he had already gained some experience with his technique. Perhaps this link biased his memories about the process, as no explicit reference is found in his first documented attempts in Berlin.",

Coincidently, he copied them in pages close to those which were used for annotating Messiaen’s analyses of Webern’s music ( Barthel-Calvet 2012 , 70). A further wrinkle at that time is that Messiaen also mentioned Ivan Wyschnegradsky’s oeuvre, which means that the idea of non-octave repeating scales ( 1972 ) might also have arisen in that manner. But Xenakis did not explicitly take advantage of this modal knowledge for his creative practices; it was, in fact, his speculations about twelve-tone music, as previously summarized, that helped him to write a section of Metastaseis . Several years later, he developed his sieves and provided explicit connections with tonal and modal scales in his theoretical essays about the topic. It is thus problematic to consider Xenakis’ music with pitch sieves as truly modal from an aural perspective, as he implemented them in very different ways.",

                "text": "[6.9] To conclude this section, I will connect the disparate elements treated earlier to show that important aspects of Xenakis’ sieves are akin to his younger reflections on serialism. In doing so, I am not suggesting that twelve-tone techniques serve as the singular, definitive germ of the sieve theory; doing this would be as reckless as drawing a direct link with Messiaen’s modes which I have characterized as his mental, a posteriori construct. I will show, however, that his speculations in the period with twelve-tone concerns and those associated with his work on algebraic operations have strong resemblances. My argument is that Xenakis’ former contact with serial music helped him to achieve insights with regard to pitch intervals of twelve-tone rows and potential operations with them that, consciously or not, were later reinjected in his conceptualizations for sieve theory. The following points support my assertion: Xenakis was aware of the existence of modular arithmetic well before he started to develop his sieves. The idea of implementing congruences with compositional purposes was already incubated in the documentation for Herma . The Anastenaria folio notebook incorporates passages sharing notational elements with this branch of algebra, which Xenakis borrowed for implicitly conceptualizing the notion of pitch classes. One of Xenakis’ main interests in the use of twelve-tone rows was an exploration of interval variety. He even considered the family of all-interval twelve-tone rows as a kind of serial category—in almost transformational terms—by itself, in the same way serial composers regarded transpositions and inversions as consistent operations. It should be remembered that Xenakis considered the intervals as the starting point for retrieving after the totality of pitch classes of an all-interval twelve-tone row. Xenakis’ sieves often generate sequences of pitches with interval arrays which are quite varied and locally unpatterned, unlike the self-evident cyclic interval content that generally structures modal music. The way he usually implemented this method tends to saturate the totality of pitch classes—i.e., to provide at least one representative of any pitch class—without an obvious patterned distribution. Examples of this condition are found in the aforementioned piano pieces in [6.3]. The Anastenaria notebook shows how Xenakis realized that the coprime values of 12 and lower than it—i.e., 1, 5, 7, and 11—were the only intervallic generators of all possible pitch-classes. In other words, he was aware that the semitone, the perfect fourth, the perfect fifth, and the major seventh are the only intervals which may generate, by recursion, the twelve pitch classes. Years later, Xenakis paid special attention to sieves whose elemental congruences had coprime modular bases with respect to the overarching bases matching with the octave. These coprime integers are again responsible for a variety of underlying pitch classes for each elemental sieve. Indeed, pitch classes within these elemental sieves are not repeated in different octaves when they span through a relatively bounded register. This feature partially echoes to the avoidance of pitch-class repetitions in twelve-tone rows. An isomorphic mapping appears between a series of semitones and a sequence of perfect fourths in the Anastenaria folio notebook, as does as a melodic draft considering the possibility of interval multiplications. Xenakis was aware of the potential transformations which are implicit in these kinds of pitch manipulations. The change of modular bases for metabolae of sieves belongs to the same kind of operations conceptually speaking, as the operation remaps the intervallic distances of the underlying elemental congruences. For example, the metabola \\(11_1\\) of \\(13_1\\) transforms minor ninths into major sevenths. In this regard, the kinds of metabolae which have been shown in this article induce a complete remap of pitches—and pitch classes when coprime numbers are involved. In particular, the presence of coprime numbers enhances the variety of remapped pitches.",

This aspect was taken up in his first text about sieves, in which he compared theoretical features of modal and serial music: Traditional modes are partially outside-time, the relationships or logical operations imposed to sound classes, intervals, characters. . .  are also outside-time.

In the first case, the order of the sieve is aurally accessible to the listener in terms of register, but in the second case, this order is blurred by a mechanism of pitch selection which depends on stochastic laws ( Squibbs 2002 , 98–100). Xenakis’s sieves are deterministic, in this case for obtaining a particular pitch distribution. By contrast, the two different ways of temporally presenting the sieve pitches in this piano piece respectively depend on determinacy and indeterminacy, illustrating how Xenakis fully conceived his sieves as outside-time structures.",

I further hope that the reader has noticed how, in light of Babbitt’s definition under paragraph [2.2] and Xenakis’ conception of outside-time structures, I have resisted treating the terms denoting twelve-tone techniques and serialism as interchangeable. Quite the contrary, I have often made use of the former as a way to neutralize the question of temporal order. All this leaves one issue to be settled, which is that the somewhat provocative question in the title of my article deserves a more nuanced answer. It is this: sieve theory should not be regarded as reminiscent of serial music, but as a consequence of some acquired knowledge of intervallic manipulations that Xenakis mastered by means of his speculations with twelve-tone techniques when he was younger—including the theoretical digressions beyond twelve-tone rows (cf. [4.10-12]). In other words, I believe that Xenakis was able to detect and isolate some deterministic aspects of intervals in the context of serial techniques that were meaningful to him as a composer, but was also willing to leave aside the intrinsic in-time features he was critical of. Many of these deterministic interval features neatly reappeared, unconsciously perhaps, in his latter formulation of sieve theory for pitches.",

The case of Boulez, who stood as the most belligerent champion of European total serialism, may illustrate this concern. His attitude famously crystallized in his harsh word of the term “ inutile ” (useless) leveled against non-serial colleagues ( Boulez 1966 , 149). His Structures I (1951–52) is a paradigmatic example of total serialism, but he rapidly pushed forward with the composition of Le Marteau sans maître (1952–55). This later piece was the first in which he exploited his harmonic multiplication. A twelve-tone row is split into several blocks, not necessarily homogeneous in size, and each block is projected, by transposing its interval content, onto the others in order to obtain different pitch-class reservoirs; here, serial order plays no substantial role ( Boulez 1966 , 168–69). (31) The procedure therefore is an abstract manipulation of the intervallic content of a twelve-tone row, which significantly blunts impact of its serial order. In this sense, Boulez’s multiplication also does not properly fit with the serial label against the backdrop of Babbitt’s definition. Even more important in the context of this article, it is not too far, conceptually speaking, from Xenakis’ algebraic speculations which led to the emergence of sieve theory. If Boulez had been aware of this, he could have been perhaps a bit more indulgent in his severe regard towards the musical approach of his Greek peer.",
