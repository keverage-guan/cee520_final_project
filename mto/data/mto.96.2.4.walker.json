He says, “[A]ny convincing challenge will have to do more than just rehearse what \namounts to a litany of anti-deconstructionist idées reçues. \nIt will need to show precisely where Derrida’s arguments go wrong; \nwhere he misreads or misconstrues his philosophical source-texts; or \nwhere the claims of deconstruction themselves fall prey to a better, more \nadequate, historically informed, or cogent theoretical critique.” (1) I accept that these conditions are fair, and I am happy to abide by them in \nthis paper. What I shall attempt here is a critique first of Derrida \nhimself, secondly of textuality and interdisciplinarity, which simplify and \ndistort Derrida’s writings, and thirdly the use that certain musicologists \nhave made of these arguments during the last decade, in writings that \nmay today be generally dubbed the New Musicology (a label bound to \ndisappear before long). If I were to limit my criticisms to the \npost-structuralist assumptions which pervade much recent work in \nmusicology and the other humanities, I might be accused by some of \nattacking too easy a target. It is for this reason that much of the present \npaper confronts the most important source for such ideas, however \nsimplified and debased they may have become in their dissemination. I \nwill remind the reader at this point that the necessary restrictions on \nspace preclude any exhaustive treatment of the issues here; according to \nthe Socratic principles examined in the first part of the paper, I would \nencourage further dialogue within the arena of mto-talk.",

In Derrida’s essay, “Plato’s \nPharmacy,” from the collection Dissemination , we find one of the \nmost frequently cited examples of a metaphysical text which contains the \nseeds of its own deconstruction (2) . Norris, in his biography of \nDerrida says that it is “a good place to start . . . since Derrida is here \nengaged with something like a mythical inaugural moment in the \n‘logocentric’ epoch whose effects (as he argues) reach down from Plato \nto the present day” (3) . Let us then begin here too. \nThe deconstruction characteristically involves an aspect of the text under \ndiscussion which would be regarded as marginal: in this case, Derrida \nexamines a metaphor, which, he claims, introduces  an element of \nsemantic undecidability that threatens to subvert the canonical reading of \nthe text. The text is a passage from Plato’s Phaedrus (4) , and in \nDerrida’s hands it begins to speak against its author; Derrida’s “close \nreading” of the text seeks to demonstrate exactly how the text’s rhetorical \nfigures may contradict its argument.",

                "text": "[3] The Phaedrus is an examination of rhetoric, which argues that \nthe art is pernicious insofar as it ignores reason and knowledge. Contrary \nto Derrida’s reading, Plato does not present rhetoric and philosophy as a \nbinary opposition, since he is condemning only some rhetoric, while \ngenerously conceding that, for example, the rhetorical school of \nIsocrates, one of Plato’s own rivals, has much of worth to offer. So Plato \nis not interested in making a rigid and unyielding distinction between the \nlogic of an argument, and the way in which it is presented. The passage \nDerrida discusses is centered upon an Egyptian myth which Socrates \nrelates to Phaedrus, the superficial young orator, by way of an \nillustration of his arguments on writing. The god Theuth came to \nThamus, the king of Egypt, offering a long list of his inventions as gifts. \nThamus first listened to the account Theuth gave of each of his gifts, \naccepting some, while rejecting others, according to his judgement of the \nmerits of each. When Theuth arrived at the gift of writing, he said, “Here \nis an accomplishment, my lord the king, which will improve both the \nwisdom and the memory of the Egyptians. I have discovered a remedy \nfor memory and wisdom.” Thamus rejects the gift, with a weighty \nreproof, which is worth quoting in full. “Theuth, my paragon of inventors, the discoverer of an art is not the best \njudge of the good or harm which will accrue to those who practise it. So \nit is in this case; you, who are the father of writing, have out of fondness \nfor your offspring attributed to it quite the opposite of its real function. \nThose who acquire it wil cease to exercise their memory and become \nforgetful; they will rely on writing to bring things to their remembrance \nby external signs instead of on their own internal resources. What you \nhave discovered is a remedy for recollection, not for memory. And as \nfor wisdom, your pupils will have the reputation for it without the \nreality: they will receive a quantity of information without proper \ninstruction, and in consequence be thought very knowledgeable when \nthey are for the most part quite ignorant. And because they are filled \nwith the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom they will be a burden \nto society.” (5) (Thamus seems to have great insight into the note-taking habits of some \nstudents, who write furiously and memorise great quantities in the hope \nthat these activities will serve as a substitute for understanding.) The \nword I rendered as “remedy” is in the original “phármakon,” \nwhich the lexicons define as alternatively a curative medicine, or a \npoison. Indeed, the two meanings are preserved in two modern Greek \ncognate words: phármakon now means medicine alone, while the \nverb pharmakóno is to poison. This is the crux of our present \nargument.",

                "text": "[4] Now according to Derrida, this apparent ambiguity renders the \nmeaning of the word “undecidable.” Let us examine this on two grounds. \nFirst, within the present context, “phármakon” clearly carries its \npositive meaning, since Theuth is hardly going to persuade the king by \noffering him a poison. Derrida realises this, but he wants to argue that \nthe other, opposed meaning insinuates itself upon the intended meaning. \nSecondly then, might the word’s use in the language settle the question of \nmeaning? I would argue that it does, and this is exactly what Derrida is \nconstrained to ignore due to his whole approach to language. For the \napparent double-meaning is not a binary opposition operating solely \nwithin a closed linguistic system, but is linked rather to features of the \nextra-linguistic material world. As Paracelsus had already said prior to \nPlato, “it depends only upon the amount whether a poison is poisonous or \nnot” (6) . So what \nwe have is not a Saussurean semantic opposition within a single signifier, \nbut the dissapointingly mundane observation that a small dose can cure, \nwhile a large dose will poison. As usual, the implicit linguistic idealism \nof deconstruction excludes the possibility of any interpretation which \nrefers to our experience and perceptions of an external world, because “il \nn’y a pas de hors-texte.” Thus a word whose meaning is readily \ncomprehensible in the context of common medical knowledge, available \nequally to Plato and to ourselves, becomes fissured by paradox through \nthe assumptions which deconstruction brings to bear on the text. The \nparadox is not therefore discovered but rather created by deconstructive \nreading of the text.",

But what kind \nof necessity is this? What are the forces which according to Derrida, \nalways already subvert the meaning of texts?

He elaborates upon this notion of the scapegoat, \nclaiming that the word is both within Plato’s text, due to the presence of \nthe supposedly related “phármakon,” but also absent, excluded, \njust as the scapegoat was excluded by the laws of the polis.

You will notice that I \nhave so far avoided mentioning the Greek word for magician and \nscapegoat. This is for a good reason. Since Attic Greek in its written \nform had no accents, only the spoken language revealed which syllables \nwere stressed. Because of Derrida’s charge that speech has been \nprivileged throughout the “logocentric epoch” this issue is of central \nimportance. What has escaped Derrida here, is the fact that magician and \nscapegoat were not rendered by the same Greek word, but rather by two, \nand the distinction is only apparent from speech (7) . pharmakós (stress on the last syllable) means scapegoat, \nwhile phármakos (stress on the first syllable) is our magician and user \nof poisonous potions. Thus the latter is a genuine relative of our original word \nphármakon, while the former disappears from the picture. This \nprovides a neat example of exactly the reverse of Derrida’s neologism \n“différance”: where Derrida created a word whose double \nmeaning—differance and deferral—is apparent only in writing, and not \nin speech, here we have a difference in meaning apparent in speech but \nnot in writing. This is a nice irony to arise from a Derridean text. The \nimportation of the scapegoat, seems designed to raise the stakes by \nintroducing a political dimension to Plato’s supposed binary oppositions; \nhowever, Derrida not only makes a very telling error in the process, but \nthe importation can only take place by a very nebulous notion of \nnecessity and forces traversing language; this is related to his semantics \nof différance, derived tendentiously from Saussure—but I shall \ndeal with this matter a little later. I might, facetiously, offer another \nexample of Derridean semantic defferal: writing, in the myth was offered \nas a gift, but of course in German, “ Gift ” means poison, reinforcing \nDerrida’s original point. By this means—admittedly more Yale \ndeconstructionist than Derridean—we can prove anything.",

In opposition to this, he places the rhetorician’s speech, \nwritten out beforehand, which can be delivered by another on a different \noccasion, to an audience quite different from that originally intended. \nThere is of course a certain irony in the fact that Plato is himself leaving \na piece of writing as a hostage to fortune, in praise of Socrates who \nresisted the temptation to depart from spoken dialectics, and so preserved \nnothing in writing; and indeed this irony can hardly have escaped Plato. \nSocrates, in the dialogue, is making a complaint of a very practical \nnature: that speeches already written out cannot answer back, and cannot \npossibly adjust themselves to the prejudices or ignorance of all future \naudiences. There is no binary opposition here, though, because, as I have \nsaid, Socrates allows for a rhetoric, an art of speech writing which is \ncarefully attuned to its audiences’ needs, not to flatter, but to persuade. \nBut of course the dialectical method remains the ideal for Socrates, since \nminds interact directly, and every fallacy, over-hasty conclusion or \nmisunderstanding can in principle be addressed immediately by the other \nspeakers. Socrates is also concerned that knowledge gained purely from \nwritten sources will not necessarily be accompanied by understanding; \nthe reader may accept the conclusions of a detailed argument \ndogmatically, without following the argument. (This matches my own \nteaching experience, since, for example, a few students in my aesthetics \ncourses have been horrified by the notion that the quality of the argument \nis to be valued above the conclusions reached, since they have been \naccustomed to the neat packaging of supposed facts, which can be \nmemorised for examination purposes—in which case, understanding is a \nmere luxury.) This is the kind of practical problem Socrates is \naddressing, and to treat it according to a hermeneutics of suspicion that \nsearches at all costs for a privileging of speech over writing seems to \nmiss the point, without any substantial gain to compensate—this is in \naddition to the fact that the alleged close reading turns out to be gravely \nflawed in ways which directly undermine Derrida’s deconstructive \ninterpretation. To put a contemporary gloss on Socrates’ argument, we \nmight offer e-mail as a form of writing which would completely satisfy \nall his strictures, since the writer can answer back; the academic e-mail \ndiscussion list, at its best, would have pleased Socrates greatly, and might \neven offer an advantage which he would acknowledge: answers can be \nmore carefully framed, since we can ponder over them at far greater \nlength than would be tolerable in spoken dialogue.",

Glancing at the translation most widely \navailable in the U.K., by Walter Hamilton (8) , the Introduction explains \nhow the seemingly disparate segments of the text are in fact carefully \nunified, whereas Derrida would have us believe that modern \ncommentators unite in proclaiming the Phaedrus too haphazard. \nNor is the writing myth shunned, or regarded as an embarrassment by \nHamilton. (I might also mention here that the Phaedrus character in the \ndialogue seems to think that Socrates has just invented the myth as a \ncolourful illustration of his argument.) It is this largely fictitious \ncanonical reading against which Derrida offers his new transgressive \ninterpretation—a dramatic backdrop to be sure, but unfortunately for \nDerrida it is also untrue.",

His daring \nspeculative leap was to suggest that the semantic level of language was \nalso governed by a system of oppositions, and it was this idea which made \nthe structuralist enterprise in the social sciences and humanities possible, \ngiving us Lévi-Strauss’s structuralist anthropology and Nattiez’s \nstructuralist musicology. Saussure was suggesting that words gained their \nmeaning purely from an intra-linguistic system of differences, each \nconcept gaining its identity from all that it was not, that is from all the \nother concepts. In the hands of Saussure’s successors, such as Jakobson, \nthis speculation began to appear unsustainable. Jakobson split the \nphonemic atom in the 1930s, showing that each phoneme consisted of a \nnumber of simultaneous material distinctive features; the science of \nphonetics can describe these features in terms of their acoustics, or in \nterms of the physiological changes in the speaker’s buccal cavity. This \nanalysis of the phoneme removed the motivation for the oppositional \nmodel in linguistics and the structuralist enterprise in general, but its \nimplications were not immediately felt (11) . The model of \nsyntagmatic and paradigmatic axes to account for the interaction of \ngrammatical and semantic features of sentences was found too weak in its \nexplanatory powers to cope with many common linguistic formations, \nand by the late 1950s the Saussurean hypotheses had all been tested and \nfound wanting (12) ; the new model for \nlinguistics was provided by Chomsky’s transformational and generative \ngrammar. (Still more important, perhaps, was the development, since \nFrege, of truth-functional semantics, of which Saussure was ignorant.) \nThis revolution in the parent science of linguistics seemed to leave \nstructuralism in the other disciplines untouched, even though the \nfoundation had now collapsed. Hence the structuralist writings of Nattiez \nas late as the 1970s (13) . Indeed, it was just as \nstructuralism in linguistics was collapsing that the francophone world \nchose, perversely to adopt it, so that its final overthrow outside \nlinguistics was not due to Chomsky, but rather to the very different \ncritique offered by Derrida. Thus we find Barthes in the early 60s \nproducing The Fashion System (14) , a largely unread work of \nmind-numbing high structuralism, while by the end of the decade, he was \nsubverting his own structuralist past in the seminars which led to the \npublication of S/Z (15) . Likewise, in francophone \nCanada, allowing for a trans-Atlantic delay, we find Nattiez furiously \nback-pedalling during the 80s in order not to appear naïve in the \nnew post-structuralist environment (16) .",

Now, in a linguistic economy of \npure difference, we are to understand that whereas we anglophones, \nthanks to our language, can carve up the world conceptually in such a \nway as to distinguish live from dead sheep, the francophone, on the other \nhand can make no such distinction.

Her reading is of course transgressive of canonical \nreadings, which fall within the norms of formalism—hence the \n“blasphemy of talking politics,” as she puts it. She characterises the \nconcerto as a form which “addresses the tensions between the dynamic \nindividual and the stable society,” the ritornelli representing stability and \nthe concertino representing dynamism. In the case of this movement, the \nritornello ill fits this description, due to its elusive phrase-structure and \nits strange melodic contours (in measures 3,4), but to point this out \nwould burden the account McClary wants to give with complications. The \ntransgressive element she picks out is the role of the harpsichord, which \nalmost succeeds in enacting a revolution, emerging from its traditional \nhumble task to overthrow not only the ripieno, but the two conventional \nsolo instruments as well. She focusses upon the famous cadenza, in which \nthe harpsichord “unleashes elements of chaos, irrationality, and noise \nuntil finally it blurs almost entirely the sense of key, meter, and form \nupon which eighteenth-century style depends.” The harpsichord only \nallows itself to be reabsorbed into the final ritornello “when the \nalternative seems to be madness.” This analysis faces some grave \nproblems. Firstly, the harpsichordist was traditionally in a position of \nleadership; the humble role McClary would assign it must leave this out \nof consideration. Secondly, the harpsichord behaves as a normal member \nof the concertino group from the first entry, so that McClary must resort \nto supressing the harpsichord’s contribution to stability for most of the \nmovement, just as she suppressed the instability of the ritornello. \nThirdly, and this is most important, the account McClary gives of the \ncadenza badly misrepresents the score: the harpsichord emerges to the \nfore gradually, not violently, and of the sixty-five measures, the first \nforty-one are more placid and undisturbed than any earlier passage. This \nsection ends with six bars of dominant pedal, from which emerges a \nresumption of the demisemiquaver arpeggios and scales from earlier in \nthe movement. The demisemiquavers proceed for six-and-a-half \nmeasures before the dominant pedal returns. Of these measures, only two \nand a half contain any chromaticism, and they take the form of a \nchromatic descent in diminished-seventh chords, such as we find elsewhere in \nBach (the B ♭ Partita, for example). Even during this short passage, the \nrhythm is very clear: the left hand takes the first note of every quaver \nbeat, while the right hand follows with three demisemiquavers. Twelve \nmeasures of unambiguous dominant pedal return after this, and the \nharpsichord cadenza ends with as much decorum as it had begun.",

Hepokoski \nportrayed opera in Italy at this time as an institution of the waning feudal \nruling class, which was being appropriated by the bourgeoisie to \nlegitimate its own world view. While enjoying the prestige derived from \naristocratic opera, the bourgeoisie also wished to dissolve the former \ngrand conventions into the immediacy, spontaneity and naturalness \npromoted by their Romantic creed.
