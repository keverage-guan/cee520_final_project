    "abstract": "Willaert’s contrapuntal idiom inMusica Nova(1559) has been characterized as “elusive” because it “largely eschews imitative textures, clear cadential articulations, distinctive rhythmic patterns and tuneful melodic ideas (soggetti)” (Fromson 2001). The present study aims to elucidate Willaert’s contrapuntal techniques in a late madrigal, “Io mi rivolgo.” Here, Willaert distinguishes sections by applying a different contrapuntal technique to each. In the absence of cadences and changes of texture, these switches of technique neatly articulate the structural members (verses, quatrains, etc.) of Petrarch’s sonnet. The analysis of the madrigal is based on melodic repetition, and relies in part on breaking long melodies into tiny fragments, using Rifkin’s principle of “motivicity” (1998).",

                "text": "[1.1] It is easy to sympathize with Michèle Fromson’s characterization of Willaert’s Musica Nova madrigals: From a modern perspective . . . the most notable feature of these late madrigals is their unusually dense and continuous contrapuntal idiom, which largely eschews imitative textures, clear cadential articulations, distinctive rhythmic patterns and tuneful melodic ideas (soggetti), which are no longer restricted to their conventional positions in the soprano and tenor parts but now roam freely and unpredictably among diverse vocal combinations. The result is an elusive contrapuntal idiom that has elicited a wide variety of critical responses from 20th-century performers and audiences alike, some of whom have found the madrigals unattractive and impenetrable even as others applaud their sensitive and expressive treatment of Petrarch’s elusive poetry ( 2001 ). The problem faced by the analyst of Willaert’s madrigals is to find repeating patterns of melodic material. Next to Josquin’s methodical, crystalline soggetto repetitions, (1) Willaert’s melodies are so constantly varied as to appear capricious. How is it possible for the teacher of Zarlino, who described the soggetto so thoroughly ( Rivera 1993 ), to have written such “impenetrable” music? One analytical approach would be to say that the soggetto—that is, the first long melody that sets a complete phrase of text—is “flexed” as to interval, rhythm, or both, when repeated in other voices. This approach is taken by John Milsom, who has dug deeply into flexed soggetti in discussing the music of Cipriano de Rore ( 2016 ). The problem is that there are no limits to flexing: any interval can apparently substitute for any other, and we are reduced to saying that it’s all just counterpoint!",

In this I follow Joshua Rifkin’s principle of motivicity, which is based on finding melodic “units” that need not be articulated by rests or associated with words: to be structural, they need only be repeated. (2) Taking Rifkin at his word, I follow this principle wherever it leads. In the case of Willaert, it leads to finding tiny melodic units as short as two semiminims. (Rifkin does not specify any minimum length for his melodic units). (3) Because these units are structural, I will refer to them as soggetti. (4) What looks like constant, capricious variation—even when text, rhythm and contour resemble each other—is underpinned by the strict use of these short soggetti. I believe that Willaert knew, perhaps from his experience as an improviser, many other short melodies that would make useful combinations with them. What looks like random flexing of long melodies is explainable by other, more rigorous, means.",

Then I will show that a change of technique is used as a large-scale sectionalizing device in the relative absence of cadences and changes of texture. (5) These switches of contrapuntal technique align well with the structural members of the poem. The idea that a change of contrapuntal technique (other than the textural change from polyphony to homorhythm) can act as a marker of formal sections has not been explored much, save for Christopher Reynolds’ 1987 article on Josquin, in which he showed how canons at different intervals formed a palindrome.",

(An annotated full score appears in Appendix 1 , along with a midi audio file. The piece has been recorded by Singer Pur on Oehms Classics OC814.) Walter Gerstenberg wrote about this piece briefly in his foreword to the volume of Willaert’s Complete Works that contains this madrigal, where he assembled over a dozen samples of various kinds of repetition of “structural” voices ( Gerstenberg 1966 , v–vi). Martha Feldman, using an Arcadelt madrigal on the same text as a foil for defining Willaert’s style, also singled out a handful of musical features in it. I will try to untangle what she has called its “dense wash of polyphony,” which exhibits an “almost indefinable succession of textures, motives, and metrical stresses” ( Feldman [1989] 2013 , 208 [2013, 616]). Where Gerstenberg and Feldman chose a few excerpts as style markers, I will provide an analysis of the whole madrigal. The present article can be considered a companion to my 2021 MTO article on an earlier, much simpler, Willaert madrigal (“Amor mi fa morire”), in which very small melodic units are likewise used in structurally interesting ways. In addition to “Io” being much longer and in an entirely different style than “Amor,” it contains more different contrapuntal techniques and fewer cadences. II. Labeling Soggetti",

                "text": "[2.1] The most important step in identifying contrapuntal techniques is the labeling of soggetti. Following Rifkin, I label any melodic fragments that repeat as meaningful units. Yet because they are so short and seem so “generic,” we must assure ourselves of their meaning by relying on context. To be labeled a soggetto, a melodic unit must be repeated as part of some identifiable structural procedure. A small melodic gesture such as a rising minor third, for instance, can be a soggetto if it is repeated in one of four contexts: When it is preceded and/or followed by another bit of melody that is repeated along with it. When it is consistently accompanied in the vertical dimension by the same bit of melody in counterpoint. When it is repeated in “interlock” with itself in imitation, sometimes in stretto fuga ( Milsom 2005b ). When it is repeatedly placed against a melody in mixed values that is used as a “figurated” cantus firmus ( contrapunto fugato ). Some melodies that seem especially generic are the cantizans or the bassizans cadential motions; however, when these are treated according to any of the above principles, they too can be called soggetti. The only melodies that do not receive the status of soggetto are those that appear in the context of free counterpoint, where none of the other melodies around it are its comrades. Milsom has dubbed such melodies “singletons” ( 2005a , 303 and 325; 2016 , 329). Example 1 . The opening of “Io,” prima parte , mins. 1–48 (click to enlarge and see the rest)",

In Example 3a, all three soggetti are marked with an asterisk, because they occur both in their recto and retrograded forms. (The recto form of soggetto f is missing its first note, C, and the retrograde form is missing its last note, C, so both forms contain only the two notes, D and A, which have their vertical comrades.) While we can read this as an A-minor chord, a D-minor chord, and an A-minor chord, these chords are also the products of thematic voice-leading motions that are heard in other contexts as well: e , for instance, has other comrades, a3 and b , at other times, as shown in Example 2a. In Example 3b, the upper voices are the same as in Example 3a, albeit inverted, but soggetto f occurs only in its recto form (the parenthesized C is a substitute note). Example 3c shows only the retrogrades of soggetti g* and e* , with soggetto g* transposed down a fourth and e* up a fifth (time shifted to make a suspension). Soggetto f′* , however, which normally would sound A-E against this pair as in Example 2d, has been transposed up a third. (6) This transposition changes the chord doubling and introduces a “major” sound with G-major and C-major chords. In Example 3d, e*/f*/g* is sounded in retrograde and then immediately with the “major” transposition as in Example 3c. This is an especially dense and beautiful succession, where e is transposed up a twelfth, g down a fourth, and f down only a step, giving the Bassus a little melodic sequence down by step. Example 3e is almost identical to 3c. In Example 3f, soggetto e rises a whole tone to approach the added note, G, while f is complete; all three soggetti have the added note that makes them e+/f+/g+ , a new module that is repeated (see Example 5a ).",

Soggetto w is longer than the v and v′ soggetti and extends quite far to the right with one altered note, the A in parentheses. In Milsom’s parlance, this is a “ragged-edged” module, or “cell” ( 2016 , 301n23).

In Example 6 , short motives n and n′ are shown set against long soggetto o , a figurated cantus firmus (i.e., a line in mixed rhythmic values). The combination of the two n s in Tenor and Quintus against the long o is repeated a fourth lower beginning at min. 87, with o transferred from the Cantus into the Tenor and the two n s in the Quintus and Bassus. Soggetto n can be viewed as a fugue subject and n’ like its tonal answer, substituting a fourth with a fifth and a step with a third (splices are shown with dotted lines). The step down after the third note of n in the Tenor against the rising fifth of n′ in the Quintus (mins. 83–84) corresponds to the splice in n′ , where a third down sounds against the rising fourth of n in the Bassus (mins. 84–85). These substitutions maintain the vertical intervals, an octave followed by a third, in the two combinations. This use of a splice in the “countersubject” is found frequently in Baroque fugues.

This sequence is repeated starting at min. 19 with some changes. The time between a1 and d in the Bassus is reduced, the solo a2 from min. 11 is eliminated before a1 / a2 / d (although another one is inserted after), and b / a3 / e followed by e / f is conflated into e / a3 / f . The result is that the second compound module is shorter than the first, 8 mins. vs. 11 mins. (The ends of e and f overlap the beginning of a1 in the Bassus and so are eliminated from the minim count.) This compression makes the second compound module more intense.

                "text": "[7.1] The foregoing account demonstrates the internal logic of “Io mi rivolgo” on the basis of the principle that musical structure depends on repetition. The method I have sketched out here may be replicated by analysts with enough patience to “look behind the tapestry, at the little knots” (as Patricia Carpenter used to say), and may eventually executed by computers. (10) In response to the reasonable objection that the soggetti I have identified are so short as to be merely generic, I would argue that Willaert’s music demands this treatment: he needs the little bits to be simple enough to be combined into longer, constantly varied melodies, and also to be placed against each other in acceptable contrapuntal combinations. As Feldman has noted, “Willaert created this kind of polyphony by manipulating the blandest of melodic materials” ( 1995 , 229). She quotes an analogy by Bernardo Daniello, a literary theorist of Willaert’s time, on building up poems from the smallest particles (vowels, consonants, syllable lengths, accents): And therefore, I would commend you, lads, were you not to disdain to imitate in your writings the master stonemasons who, before setting themselves to the task of building . . . choose those stones or tiles which seem to them most suited to the composition of the wall . . . . And then, having chosen them, begin to adapt and compose them with one another—now a large with a small, now a narrow with a wide; now a whole with a broken; sometimes one lengthwise, another one crosswise, placing one one way, another another way, until the wall reaches that height which it must in order to be beautiful and well proportioned.” ( 1995 , 150) I imagine, based on his use of contrapunto fugato , that “Adriano Cantore” was a great improviser as a young singer in Ferrara ( Lockwood 2001 ), and that he could keep all these little fragments and combinations, like field stones, in his head.",

The ability to hold many contrapuntal combinations in the mind is a skill that we have lost, making much Renaissance music harder for us to understand. To Willaert, these tiny melodies did not seem trivial and forgettable, as they do to us now.",

The madrigal abounds in ancillary melodies joined with thematic ones, such as the aforementioned Savonarolan tune (Example 16). One of my favorite joinings occurs in the Altus in the prima parte on “sbigottito e smorto” (Example 11a): the first three notes are ancillary and the last three are thematic, and an expressive cross-relation occurs on “smorto.”",

Even after deciding to distinguish poetic verses by melodic content (e.g., p and q vs. r and s ), he would have had to decide which voices were to lead the way. I imagine that in the opening he decided early on that a1 in the Bassus would be followed by d sooner in the second compound module, and then he added the upper ancillary voices accordingly; or that he would shuffle i1 , i2 and i3 the second time, or that he would compose something spectacular for the end ( contrapunto fugato and quodlibet at the same time).",

                "text": "[7.5] Finally, we might wonder whether Willaert’s combinations of short melodic fragments are meant to be heard. The e/f/g combinations in Examples 2 and 3 are difficult to identify when heard in context, despite the frequency with which they repeat. I imagine Willaert saying to himself: “I can build a piece out of repeating combinations, as Josquin did, but present a much less obvious, predictable surface. (11) If I compose an imitative duo in one pair of voices, I won’t repeat it in another pair of voices.” Indeed, most of the long soggetti that imitate ( f+ , h1-h2 , p , u or x ), or that are used as cantus firmi ( o , t1-t2 , y , z ) sound only twice (exceptions are a , that sounds a third time altered, and q and w , that sound again but are truncated). He might have added, “If I do repeat a long melody in all voices, I’ll present it in a kaleidoscope of interlocks (like i1 , i2 and i3 ).” The richness of this music lies in a strange combination of rigor and freedom, familiarity and novelty.",
