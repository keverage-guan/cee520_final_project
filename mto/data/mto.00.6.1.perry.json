Just as tonal theory in the United States divides pedagogically into\ntwo periods, one prior to the 1979 publication of Free Composition , the English translation of Schenker’s magnum\nopus, and one subsequent; so, too, pedagogically, the analysis and theory of twentieth century musical modernism is likewise divided into two epochs by the 1973 publication of\nForte’s germinal The Structure of Atonal Music (hereinafter SAM ).  Both writers seek maximal theoretical utility and\nrigor, often prizing the most conceptually efficient analysis of a given passage over the most intuitively comfortable.\nObjections to Forte’s analytical methodology echo objections made to Schenker’s, as do plausible answers to those\nobjections: just as complaints about the apparent marginalization of rhythm, form and motivic relationships in\nthe latter’s graphic analyses have come to seem less warranted in the light of the Schenker scholarship of the\nlast two decades, the seemingly minor role played by these same elements in SAM has to a large extent been addressed\nby a quarter century of amplificatory analysis, theory-building and criticism, much of it by Forte himself.  Forte’s\nwork may not satisfy everyone, but any serious study of twentieth century music ignores the primitives and theorems\nof Forte’s universe at great peril. (One finds one’s self “translating” valuable analytical literature from the “pre-Forte” years, such as George Perle’s Serial Composition and Atonality of 1963, into more contemporary language, i.e.\nForte’s language, as one reads.)",

Most\nrecently (1990), Joseph N. Straus has sought to redefine the pedagogical mainstream of twentieth century music in his Remaking the Past and Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory , both of which are strongly Fortean in their\norientation. (1) It is worth pointing out that unlike many of his detractors\n(and for that matter unlike Schenker), he has consistently and boldly widened his scope of inquiry; his early p.c. set\ntheory work has been the point of departure for an extensive investigation of an ever-broadening repertoire that ranges\n(so far) from the Second Viennese trinity to composers such as Liszt, Debussy, Mussorgsky, Stravinsky and Charles Ives.\nIn addition, Forte has recently emerged as a major historian of the twentieth-century American popular\nsong.

                "text": "[1.3] Forte has been general editor of Yale University Press’s Composers of the Twentieth Century Series since its inception\nin the 1980s.  Given the fact that the music of the Second Viennese trinity has been a kind of theoretical and analytic\nlodestone for Forte throughout his career, the absence (until now) of a Webern volume in the series has been puzzling.  It\nis only fitting, therefore, that the master himself weigh in at long last with this nearly exhaustive study of Webern’s\natonal works, i.e. those which follow the arguably tonal Entflieht auf leichten Kähnen Op. 2 and those which precede\nthe indisputably serial Drei Volkstexte Op. 17.  The other volumes in the series bear straightforward “Music of” titles;\nthe fact that this is a study only of this one strategic slice of Webern’s output represents a significant departure\nfrom prior practice.  There are, I think, two reasons for this departure.  First, avoidance of Webern’s earliest, tonal\nworks (which receive a few mentions in the present volume insofar as they relate to Forte’s octatonic thesis, about\nwhich more below) permits Forte to avoid the analytically and conceptually “soft” topic of how and when tonality ceases to\noperate as a meaningful element in Webern’s music.  Second, although we will never know for certain, one suspects that at\nsome point prior to the publication of SAM , a sort of Great Powers agreement was concluded between Allen Forte and Milton\nBabbitt, limiting Forte’s analytical theater of operations, with a few exceptions, to non-serial\nrepertoires. (3) More to the point, of course, is the fairly recent publication of an\nimpressive study of Webern’s serial music by Kathryn Bailey, which Forte’s book complements rather well both as to the\nrepertoires surveyed and as to analytic ethos.

A major shift\nin Forte’s approach to Webern’s music is signaled by the fact that his 1994 analysis of the first of the Six Bagatelles Op.\n9 is entitled “An Octatonic Essay by Webern,” while the present volume seeks to explain the entirety of Webern’s\natonal output in terms of the field defined by the three forms of the octatonic collection.  Although set class 8-28\nrates only a few asides in SAM ,   Forte’s interest in things octatonic has grown steadily over the past few\ndecades, and the emergence of his conviction that the octatonic field is an essential part of the syntax of\ntwentieth century music apparently dates from the early or middle 1990s, thus postdating Pieter van den Toorn’s\nillumination of the role of the octatonic in Stravinsky’s music.

Following this is an introductory chapter which briefly surveys the\noften sorry state of Webern reception and influence, in which Forte presents a selection of quotes by contemporary\ncomposers, mostly active in the 1950s, assessing the importance of Webern to them.  These quotes should be re-read\nwhenever the reader tires of Forte’s unrelenting pace; one begins to see the value of American formalism when the only\nalternative is Darmstadt obscurantism. (5) Forte then\ninvestigates several of the early atonal songs (selections from opp. 3 and 4, plus the posthumously published Dehmel\nLieder of 1906–08) in his third chapter, devotes a chapter to each of the next eight opus numbers\n(opp. 5 through 12), and ends with two chapters devoted to the four sets of songs that\ncomplete Webern’s published atonal works, up to and including the Latin Canons Op. 16.  The analytical literature as a\nwhole has short-changed Webern’s songs rather shamefully; Forte, however, provides a balanced treatment which restores\nthe vocal works to their central place in Webern’s output without slighting the instrumental music.  His insightful\ntreatment of Webern’s text setting is perhaps the best thing about this book. (6)",

In the\npresent work, for instance, he tirelessly maps out the surface of several dozen individual movements by Webern, in\nmany cases relating each and every note to a matrix consisting of octatonic subsets grouped together according to\nwhich of the three forms of p.c. set class 8-28 they evoke. As often is the case with Forte, the actual analytical\ninsights are often concealed below the surface of the analyses.  Insights are here in abundance, however,\nespecially in Forte’s treatment of the later works of Webern’s atonal oeuvre ,\nopp. 12–16.  Paradoxically, it is in discussing these works that Forte makes his case for the\ncentrality of the octatonic to Webern’s music most convincingly, even though (as Forte himself admits) his\noctatonic Swiss army knife works less infallibly here than in the earlier opus numbers due to Webern’s introduction of an\nincreasing number of non-octatonic surface formations.  His treatments of opera 5 through 11, which are the most familiar\nanalyst fodder in the book, are unlikely to please most scholars with an emotional and vocational stake in Webern\nanalysis, since Forte’s octatonic re-mapping of these well-known pieces tend to ignore virtually everyone’s favorite\nnotes, favorite lines, and favorite segmentations in the service of octatonic clarity.

                "text": "[2.2] Forte’s thesis is that octatonicism governs much of Webern’s atonal music.  Other salient collections, e.g. the\ncomposer’s favorite 4-7 tetrachord, tend to appear “at junctions of distinct forms of the octatonic and through\ninterpolations.”  Forte makes it clear that by octatonicism he means octatonic cycles, i.e. deployments of significant\nsegments of each of the three distinct forms of the octatonic, labeled according to van den Toorn’s practice as\nCI, CII, and CIII.  Formations that do not themselves form subsets of the octatonic collection are often explainable as\nthe conjunction of octatonic subsets from two of the three discrete forms of the octatonic collection; Forte’s\ninsistence on the hegemony of the octatonic is most vexing when such formations already seem to be perfectly straight-ahead instantiations of chromaticism or salient p.c. set\nclasses which are not part of the octatonic system.  This text is, if nothing else, a valuable experiment in putting\none’s favorite readings of Webern on hold and approaching the music with fresh, albeit often counterintuitively tuned,\nears.

A conventional, chromatically-oriented analysis of the first seven measures\nof this movement hears the semitonally ascending line e 1 (measure 1) - f 1 (measure 3) - g ♭ 1 (measure 4) - g 1 (measure 6) as a kind of guiding progression along with a complementary descending\nline starting on the viola’s c 1 in measure 1, moving by semitone to the first violin’s a in measure 7, forming a “wedge” formation\nof the sort familiar from certain pieces by Bartok and Berg. Complications result in measure 6 from the exact coincidence of\nthe viola’s a ♭ 1 with the cello’s g 1 , which obscures the orderly ascent of the upper line (the a ♭ 1 ought to occur at\nsome point after the g 1 has sounded), and from the delayed arrival of the first violin’s a, which, if the first-species rhythm of measures 1–4 were maintained, would arrive at\nthe same moment as the viola’s a ♭ 1 in measure 6, rather than a full measure later.  Disambiguation of these complications\noccur in the second half of the piece (measures 8–13), which thus becomes an atonal analogue to continuous binary form,\nespecially since the “wedge” of measures 1–7 starts over in measure 8, this time from the single axis pitch e1 rather from the dual\nc 1 - e 1 axis of measure 1.  The problematic a ♭ 1 of measure 6 and\nthe a ♭ that would conclude the lower of the two “wedge” lines in measures 1–7 finally appear in measures 11 and 12, thus tying the\ntwo halves of the movement together and providing a type of formal closure that is easily conveyed in both analysis and\nperformance.  Closure is further ensured by the i.c. 1 Stimmentausch involving the pitch classes D and C ♯ that\nundergirds the last five measures of the piece; C ♯ is the first note of the movement’s first moving melodic line in measure 1, and D is the next note in the “wedge” formation begun in\nmeasure 8, octave displaced for emphasis (an unsounded d 1 is the point of origin of both upper and lower “wedge” lines in measures\n1–7, furthermore).",

Instead, Forte’s more inclusive understanding of octatonicism explains almost every\npassage reasonably well, but almost sets aside the issue of audibility; the fact that each of the three octatonic\ncollections is equidistant from the other two, each sharing half its membership (four p.c.s) with either of the other\ntwo, makes it hard to hear the completion of an octatonic set per se as a salient event.  Further, with all three\noctatonic collections in play at all times, the issue of falsifiability rears its head; can one imagine any complex\nchromatic music that isn’t, in Forte’s terms, octatonic?

The present volume, however, makes good use of sketch materials.  Based on his study of the latter, Forte\nseems to conclude that composing these pieces was for Webern largely a process of balancing his emerging octatonic ear\nwith (1) the need to set his chosen texts subtlely and expressively and (2) his compulsion to weave certain\ntalismanic pitch ciphers into the musical fabric. Occasionally, Forte finds Webern’s starting point to be a\ngiven pitch dyad or similar small unit; in reviewing sketches for Op. 15 No. 4, for instance, he suggests that Webern may\nhave arrived at 6-30 from CI as the only good setting of the dyad b- b ♭ 1, which he wanted to privilege for compositional\nreasons.

The sketches, furthermore, certainly\nlead to unsettling conclusions about Webern’s sanity: given the composer’s own admission that Op. 6 is in some sense\nabout his own reaction to the death of his mother, the prevalence of the A-ES or EsCHBEG ciphers, associated with\nArnold Schoenberg, is bizarre; on the other hand, after a period during which the Schoenberg cipher appears in close\nconjunction with ciphers that stand for Christ (with whom, it seems, Webern’s beloved teacher was enharmonically\nequivalent), in the religiously-oriented Opp. 15 and 16 song sets Schoenberg’s pitch ciphers start to disappear and pitch\nformulas associated with more conventional religious figures such as Christ and the Virgin Mary begin to predominate.\nForte’s presentation of these pitch ciphers is not unproblematic, however, since he seems to feel that the\nextra-musical associations of “the ubiquitous Schoenberg icon,” i.e. the pitch motto EsCHBEG, which belongs to set\nclass 6-z44, inhere to all forms of its set class, as well as to forms of its complement,\n6-z19.

(Anyone doubting the contention that Forte’s main contribution to the field of\nmusic theory has been in raising the standards of discourse need only consult, for example, the analysis by Roy Travis\nthat accompanies Forte’s in the JMT analysis symposium of 1974 on a posthumously published orchestral work of 1913;\nTravis’s analysis, which with its use of Schenkerian apparatus in the service of atonal analysis has retained its\nability to provoke, nevertheless seems a rather whimsical commentary on Forte’s.

                "text": "[6.10] In the final analysis, there can be little doubt that this book will change the terms of debate on the atonal music\nof Webern.  What it cannot do is give this repertoire a performing presence.  Like Schoenberg, Webern occupies for\nthe most part a special niche, that of a composer better known to scholars than to performers.  On the other hand,\neven three more performances of Webern’s music by major orchestras or soloists in a single year would be\nstatistically significant.  More performances would help to assemble what analysts have needed for a long time; a base-line of performance practice against which to evaluate their\nanalysis.  How do our best performers hear this music?  If Forte’s octatonic matrix provokes discussion and thought\namong even a few conductors and performers, who are, I suspect, largely ignorant of the extensive body of Webern\nanalysis by theorists and for theorists, and who will have here a tidily presented and compelling way of understanding\nthis music, perhaps Allen Forte’s most enduring legacy will be the most valuable of all—the entrance of Webern’s\natonal works into some sort of performing (as opposed to analytical) canon.",
