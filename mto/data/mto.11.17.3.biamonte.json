The session title, devised by Brad Osborn, reflects its integration of formal theory (“Form in Rock”) and performance (“Performing Rock”). The session comprised four papers exploring issues of form in popular music, with a response by Mark Spicer. As a way of reflecting the aural and performative traditions of rock music and reconnecting the practices of theory and analysis to that of music making, each presentation—including the response—incorporated live music examples, which have been replaced in this volume by audio and video excerpts. These five papers are presented here in expanded form, along with three essays concerned with aspects of form in pop-rock music not addressed in the original session.",

Formal patterns in rock often feature greater complexity than is generally realized, particularly in regard to the interactions of form with domains other than pitch, such as rhythm, texture, and timbre. This holds true even for the apparently straightforward simple and compound strophic forms that abound in the pop-rock repertoire, as well as for more intricate multipart and through-composed forms.",

Formal analyses have typically focused either on the delineation of sections through lyrics, chord patterns, texture, and key, with secondary considerations of rhythmic activity, register, dynamics, and timbre, or on the interaction of these sections with overall forms as regards repetition, ordering, thematic content and interrelationships, and rhetorical function. General discussions of formal sections and patterns include the brief definitions of basic section types in Stephenson 2002 ; a survey of the relationship of section types to larger formal patterns in Covach 2005 ; a detailed investigation of phrase, form, and function in Everett 2009 ; historic, cultural, and generic contextualizations in Middleton 1999 ; a model for the interactions of formal sections and tonal centers in Capuzzo 2009 ; and an exploration of large-scale dramatic structures in Spicer 2004 . (1) There are also many studies of idiomatic formal structures and relationships within the works of a single artist or band—or genre or era, although these are less common—and comparisons of a given song’s transformation through covers, remixes, and mashups.

To these papers we have added three essays that explore additional aspects of form through the works of a single artist or group: a broad consideration of formal structures in the music of U2 (Endrinal), a case study of phrase structure in the music of Sarah McLachlan (Attas), and a reconciliation of Schenkerian analysis with formal issues in early Beatles songs (Nobile).",

He applies the sentential SRDC model of statement, restatement or response, departure, \nand conclusion or return described in Everett 2009 to phrases (as in AABA patterns within a verse or chorus section) and to song sections (as in the bridge of a verse-chorus form), demonstrating through inductive analysis how “departure” phrases and sections coalesced into the prechorus, which intensifies expectation and desire for the climactic conclusion of the chorus. The historical emergence of the prechorus section is documented with statistics from the Billboard Annual Top 20 song charts.",

The article also defines the “breakout chorus,” which is marked in comparison to preceding musical material by contrasts in various parameters, typically some combination of dynamics, lyrics, melodic and harmonic structures, rhythmic activity, texture, timbre, and tonal center.

The article delineates a taxonomy of four formal types distinguished by the presence or absence of hierarchical grouping structure and by thematic unity or contrast, and offers some preliminary correlations of these forms with genre.

He explores the expressive connotations of open-chord versus barre-chord voicings, and the multifaceted role of the resulting transformational networks as embodied gestures that project a rich array of meanings: not only large-scale harmonic and formal relationships but also expressive connotations, stylistic tropes, and cultural commentaries. Drawing on work in cognition by Saslaw ( 1996 ) and Zbikowski ( 2002 ), he theorizes these patterns as body-derived image schemas and conceptual models.",
