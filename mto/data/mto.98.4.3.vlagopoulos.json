Athens\nand Thessaloniki offer roughly the same courses, with the\naddition of preparatory courses in Harmony and Counterpoint.\nMusic theory courses are conceived as further elaboration of\nknowledge acquired on the conservatory level one the one hand\nand, on the other, as an introduction to music analytical\nmethods, especially Schenkerian and set theory.  Most of the\npeople responsible for these courses were educated in England or\nin the United States.  Professor Theodore Antoniou, perhaps the\nmost representative example of such faculty, is an active\ncomposer and university teacher in Athens and in Boston.\nFrench-educated people, such as theorist and composer Charis\nXanthoudakis at the Ionion University, aspire to a more\nartistically imaginative, semiotically orientated teaching style.\nUnderstandably, much teaching time is devoted to the study of the\nintricate Byzantine notation and theoretical modal system.",

                "text": "[2] Until 1990, music theory was traditionally taught exclusively at\nthe conservatories, which issue diplomas in Music Theory,\nHarmony, Counterpoint, and Fugue.  All Greek composers, from\nManolis Kalomoiris (1883â€“1962), the patriarch of modern Greek\nmusic, to I.  Ioannidis and M.  Traulos, were educated at\nconservatories.  Many make a living by teaching in those\ninstitutions and are thus responsible for a generally good level\nof music theory teaching (unlike, alas, the situation of\nhistorical courses).",

This year, for example, a\nComposers Forum series was organised, in which composers of the\nolder generation, alternating with younger ones, lectured on\ntheir aesthetic and compositional orientations, influences, and\naspirations, explained their musical system, and entered in\nlively dialogue with what was mostly a public of fellow\nmusicians.  The names of the composes presented are Arghyris\nKounadis (9 March), Konstantia Gourzi (23 March), Dimitri\nDraghatakis (6 April), Minas Alexiadhis (27 April), and later\nGhiorghos Kouroupos (11 May), and the Amsterdam-based Kalliope\nTsoupaki (25 May).",
