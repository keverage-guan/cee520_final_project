These two questions will be addressed with reference to the treatiseWiener-Tonschule; oder Anweisung zum Generalbaße, zur Harmonie, zum Contrapuncte und der Fugen-lehre(1827), by the Viennese theorist Joseph Preindl (1756–1823). To answer the question “Why?”: a figured-bass treatise such as Preindl’s might have accounted for modulation as a means to facilitate improvisation of preludes or fantasies, and it might have done so under the developing influence of northern Teutonic theorists of modulation such as Gottfried Weber and Abbe Vogler. To answer the question “How?”: a figured-bass treatise might account for modulation through a pattern-based approach, but it should not do so through a pivot-chord approach, since the latter presumes an understanding of chordal root harmony that lies beyond the scope of figured bass.",

We often limit \npivot harmonies to diatonic triads or seventh chords, and sometimes extend this \nto include applied chords and ultimately such chromatic chords as the Neapolitan \nand the augmented sixth.

In essence, Preindl’s principal notion of tonal function is \ngrounded not in chordal relationship but in an older modal conception of the plagal \nversus authentic classification. He makes a rudimentary distinction between “ground” \nbass (the chordal root) and “fundamental bass” (the lowest note at the moment), \nand this allows him inversion.

Accordingly, his definition of function is not introduced \nwith chords but instead in a discussion of scales that draws upon older modal conceptions \nof function and centricity. Preindl begins by defining keys and scales in terms \nof Greek modes: The Greeks had six principal (authentic) and six secondary (plagal) modes, \n  the scales of which were distinguished by the position of two semitones. [Die Greichen hatten sechs Haupt- und sechs Nebentonarten, deren Tonleiter \n  hinsichtlich der Lage der zwey halben Töne sich unterschied.]{9} He proceeds to distinguish among the plagal modes by invoking the old solmization \nsyllables and the position of mi-fa on different scale degrees in the various modes. [2.4.2] For Preindl, the authentic and plagal forms of these modes differ functionally \nin terms of tonic [Grundton] and dominant [Unter-quart] points of reference: Authentic modes proceed from the tonic, [while] the plagals must begin with \n  the fourth below, or the dominant. [ . . . [D]ie authentische von dem Grundton (der Tonica ) ausging, mußte \n  die plagalische in deren Unter-Quart (der Dominante ) beginnen.]{11} And he underlines the importance of this older, modal conception: An understanding of these old scales is an essential fundamental to the Generalbaß performer as organist, since the church chorales of the Protestant \n  Rite, which the organist is obliged to accompany, are based upon them. These modi authentici et plagales are the foundation of our present keys. [Die Kenntniß dieser alten Tonleiter ist dem Generalbaß-Spieler, als Organisten, \n  aus dem Grunde wichtig, weil in den meisten derselben die Kirchen-Choräle des \n  protestantischen Ritus gesetzt sind, welche mit der Orgel zu begleiten ihm obliegt. \n  Diese modi authentici et plagales sind allerdings die Grundlage unserer \n  heutigen Tages gebräuchlichen Tonarten.]{12} The functional conception with which Preindl works, then, is modal in conception, \nnot out of keeping with his Viennese inheritance—Catholic or Protestant—but surely \nof limited means when dealing with a chord-based conception of modulation, as we \nshall see shortly.",

Complete chords comprise three, four, five, or more tones. \nSome of these are what we today call root position [ Grunde- or Stamm-Accorde ], \nothers are superposed or inverted [ versetzte or umgekehrte ], and all \nare, like intervals, consonant or dissonant: A chord is formed from the simultaneous sounding of several well measured and \n  mutually related intervals . . .

In principle, the Grund-Accorde are the source from which all other chords flow. They take four shapes: as complete, \nperfect, and pure triads, major or minor, or as major or minor triads with the addition \nof a minor seventh. [2.5.3] Preindl’s definition of inversion depends upon the distinction between \nwhat he calls ground and fundamental bass ( Grundbaß versus Fundamental-Baßis ). \nPreindl’s Grundbaß is what we know as root position; his Fundamental-Baßis is the lowest tone of a chord, or the Grundton : If one takes the third above the ground bass of a pure, harmonic triad as the \n  fundamental bass, then the three-six [Terzsexten] chord is produced; for example \n  instead of C in the C-major harmony, E stands as the ground tone [Grundton]. . \n  .

B. \n  anstatt C der C-dur Harmonie E als Grundton . . . ]{23} To reiterate, for the true, pure Generalbaßlehre , such a distinction is \nlargely irrelevant. Every bass note is simply a Grundton . By invoking Grundbaß , Preindl transgresses the bounds of what would be a self-standing figured-bass \nconception and moves over into the other subject in his title, Harmonielehre .",

Letter names, in and of themselves however, \ncannot express function: Here we hear all the notes of the first and fourth bars as a C harmony, and \n  those of the second bar as belonging to F, which the bass A necessitates calling \n  a sixth chord. The B of the third bar is the first inversion of the seventh chord \n  over the fundamental G, arranged as a six-five chord. [Hier gehören alle durchgehende Noten des ersten und vierten Tacts zur C-harmonie, \n  jene des zweyten in den Umfang von F, daraus der Baß A den Sext-Accord verlangt; \n  und das H im dritten Tacte ist die erste Versetzung der Septime über die Grundnote \n  G, in den Quint-Sext-Accord umgestaltet, und all Nebennoten in demselben enthalten.]{34} In the treatise, then, there is no indication of systematic functional relationship \namong these harmonies, such as a roman numeral might indicate. Since pivotal chordal \nfunctions are a presupposition in most accounts of harmony and modulation, Preindl \nmust devise other means by which to address the topic.",

                "text": "[2.7] Key relationship [2.7.1] In section 9, “On Signatures [Von der Bezifferung],” Preindl introduces \nthe issue of key relation. He does so by charting tonal spaces: chords representing \nkeys (locations in space) are linked by intervals (distances), and in particular \nby interval patterns (a well-defined space measured by regular distances). In and \nof itself, this kind of tonal space is unremarkable, a commonplace in the customary \nrepresentation of key signatures. But Preindl will put this spatial conception of \nkey-relation-through-interval-pattern to use later, when he addresses modulation. [2.7.2] Key signatures are introduced in a series of four-part progressions. \nFirst Preindl arranges chords representing keys in perfect fifth relation, as if \naround the cycle of fifths. Calling these examples “row-successions” [ Reihenfolge ], \nhe applies this cyclic presentation to show key relationship in both major and minor \nkeys. [2.7.3] In a second, supplementary four-part progression, Preindl sets up a “Changing \nSuccession” [ Wechselfolge ] that visits all major and minor keys by means \nof a different interval pattern, a series of root-position chords with basses descending \nin alternating major and minor thirds: C major – A minor – F major – D minor – B-flat major, etc. [2.7.4] These two cyclic forms of key representation, Reihenfolge and Wechselfolge , give Preindl a model or template for a patterned-bass approach \nto modulation. This approach is quite in keeping with a figured-bass conception, \nsince, in describing modulatory distance and relation, it relies only upon intervals \nexpressed in a bass melody, and not upon chordal-roots and the concept of pivot \nchords, which are extraneous to figured bass. Preindl’s other modulatory tool—the \npivot chord—has no such model or template, nor is it so comfortably at home with \nhis figured-bass conception. [2.7.5] Let us take stock of the fundamentals Preindl’s treatise has given us \nthus far: a notion of fixed relationship; an incomplete notion of scale-degree function \nin the modal sense of tonic and dominant finals; a distinction between chordal root \nand the lowest note of a chord; and another curiously incomplete notion of function \nbased upon tonic, mediant, and dominant, but no others. To this we can add key signatures \nlinked by cyclic intervals. If we compare this with the requirements for a complete, \nmodern discussion of modulation, several items are missing: a systematic and articulate \nnotion of chordal roots as expressions of particular scale degrees in a given key, \na notion of key relation based upon common elements such as pivot chords, and the \nconcepts of tonicization and applied chromatic chords in diatonic contexts. Without \nthese items, which, to reiterate, do not belong in a pure figured-bass treatise, \nPreindl seems hard pressed to elucidate modulation. But elucidate he does, with \nvarying and limited results. [3] From the Wiener-Tonschule : Modulation",

In essence, \nmodulation (and this modulatory ability) depends upon a certain harmonic propriety \n[ harmonische Richtigkeit ] that governs the movement from one key to another: In order that the ideas be beautiful and noble, the player must be self-assured \n  in modulation, which means the ability to move from one key to the others with \n  harmonic propriety.

                "text": "[3.5] Patterned basses [3.5.1] Bass in ascending fourths and descending thirds; pages 158–61; 18 progressions. \nThe bass follows a pattern of an ascending fourth followed by a descending third, \nwhile the soprano moves by ascending conjunct motion. Example 2 (click to enlarge) Example 3 (click to enlarge) [3.5.1.1] A diatonic model is established with the first, non-modulating example, \nwhich comprises five ascending fourths, with the caution (curiously not observed \nin the model) to avoid the leap of an augmented fourth: If the bass voice rises upward by leaps of a perfect fourth (which, however, \n  may not be augmented), one can accompany it with complete perfect triads . . . . [ Example 2 , {158}] [Wenn die Baßstimmen in reinen Quart-Sprüngen—welche aber nie übermäßige seyn \n  dürfen—aufwärts steigt, kann man mit lauter vollkommenen Dreyklängen begleiten . . . ]{157} Note that the model is scalar in nature: it entails a stepwise progression through \nat least a perfect fifth in all parts (the bass line embellished by leaps of a third \nafter every step). Preindl’s principal framework in this and the other bass patterns \nis the scale. [3.5.1.2] From this diatonic scalar model, two chromatic models are derived, \none adding sharps, the other flats, which take them into the desired new keys, B \nmajor and B-flat major respectively [ Example 3 , {158}]. The basses in both models comprise \nfour ascending fourths, again arranged in the manner of a scale. In these and subsequent \nexamples, the modulations are accomplished (often suddenly) by means of chromatic \nalteration. Notes of the basic diatonic scale are simply altered chromatically to \nlead into the desired key. Preindl refers to these modulations as a process of distinguishing \n[ unterscheiden ] scales by means of appropriate sharps or flats. He offers \nthe following explanation accordingly: If one wants to modulate from one major key to another, one can distinguish \n  all intervening scales through their appropriate sharps or flats; for example, \n  from C major to B major . . . or from C major to B-flat major [Example 3, {158}]. [Will man von einer Dur-Tonart in eine andere moduliren, so kann man auch alle \n  Zwischen-Scalen durch die ihnen zuständigen [sharp sign] oder [flat sign] unterschieden; \n  z. B. von C-dur nach H-dur . . . oder: von C-dur nach B-dur.]{158} The meaning of “intervening scale” is not clear, but implicit is a sense of tonal \ntopography: between C major (no sharps) and B major (5 sharps) lie intermediary \nkeys with 1, 2, 3, and 4 sharps. In modulation, presumably one adds these sharps \nand in doing so touches upon these intermediary keys. To reiterate: the frame of \nreference is the diatonic scale. No pivot-chord relationship is implied here, but \ninstead accidentals are merely added until the key signature of goal of modulation \nis attained. [3.5.1.3] In the second part of Example 3, which goes from C to B-flat major, \nPreindl overshoots his mark, seemingly, by adding A-flat (ostensibly to avoid the \ntritone): Since the key of B-flat major contains only two flats in its key signature, \n  so the continuation must go from E-flat to A-flat so as to avoid the leap of an \n  augmented fourth [E-flat to A-natural] . . . [Wiewohl die Tonart B-dur nur zwey B in der Vozeichnung enthält, so muß die \n  Forschreitung dennoch von Es nach As . . . geschehen, um den übermäßigen Quart-Sprung \n  zu vermeiden.]{158} Example 4 (click to enlarge) Example 5 (click to enlarge) Example 6 (click to enlarge) Example 7 (click to enlarge) Example 8 (click to enlarge) Example 9 (click to enlarge) [3.5.1.4] Subsequent progressions in this category make minor alteration to these \ntwo chromatic models. They truncate the model, thus making the modulations less \ndistant [ Example 4 , \n{158}]. Or they introduce their chromaticisms quickly and make their modulations \nmore remote [ Example 5 , \n{159}]. Some of them merely embellish their models with neighboring and suspension \nfigures. Others demonstrate the use of enharmonic equivalence, which, for Preindl, \nmeant the enharmonic equivalence of intervals, not merely pitches: If one wants to modulate, for example, from D-flat major (with five flats in \n  the key signature) to B-major (with five sharps), one thinks of C-sharp in lieu \n  of D-flat as the first tone and adjusts the following chord progression accordingly \n  [ Example 6 , {161}]. [Wollte man z. B. von Des-dur (mit fünf Been im Schlüßel) nach H-dur (mit fünf \n  Kreuzen) moduliren, so denke man statt des ersten Tones: Des sich Cis, und richte \n  nach der davon auslaufenden Accordenfolge die Quart-Sprünge ein . . . ]{161} In essence, the progressions in this category adapt the basic scalar model of \nthe cyclic bass pattern (and its counterpointed soprano) to various kinds of chromatic \nalteration. Preindl’s Wegweiser as signpost is economic to a fault: let the \nbass ascend by fourth then descend by third, thus forming an embellished scale fragment; \nadd chromatic alterations so as to move (slowly or rapidly) into the scale of the \ntarget key. Having illustrated major-key modulation from C to B and B-flat, Preindl \ncontinues onward systematically to apply his model in major-key modulations from \nC to A, A-flat, G, G-flat, F, E, E-flat, D, and finally D-flat. [3.5.1.5] The modulatory guidelines established with the first two models [Example \n3] \nadmit only slight alteration in Preindl’s text: for reasons of harshness it is better \nto exceed the goal of modulation and then fall back an accidental—go as far as \nB major, for example, then fall back to E major. Preindl does not speak of this \nas establishing the key of B major but rather of rising to the dominant B and establishing \nit by cadence first: In this last example, it is better and less harsh sounding if one rises up \n  by the interval of a fourth to the dominant B, and cadences there first. [ Example \n  7 , {159}]. [In diesem letzten Exempel ist es beßer, und weniger hart klingend, wenn man \n  in Quart-Sprüngen bis zur Dominant H hinauf steigt, und dort erst cadenzirt.]{159} Tonicization is implicit here, but without a more refined notion of chordal function \n(to include applied dominants, for example) Preindl must fall back upon the terms \nof his model: this is merely the addition of a redundant Quart-Sprung , which \nproduces the effect of mitigating harshness. [3.5.2] Bass in descending octave scales; pages 162–66; 15 progressions. [3.5.2.1] Bass and soprano descend an octave through a scale-based pattern of \nsuspensions, which Preindl describes as alternating 2 and harmonies. Again a \ndiatonic, non-modulating model is established in both major and minor: Further, one can accompany the complete octave scale with alternating 2 and chords . . . [ Example 8 , \n  {162}] [Ferner kann man herab den ganzen Octavengang mit abwechselnden Secunden- und \n  Quint-Sexten-Accorden begleiten . . . ]{161} [3.5.2.2] Preindl then arranges his modulating examples so as to cadence to keys \narranged in ascending order, the first one to D-flat major [ Example 9 , {162}], the second to D major, and so forth, \nuntil B major. The descending octave-scale pattern is merely truncated in the later \nexamples, with more elaborate cadences in A-flat, A, B-flat, and B major. [3.5.2.3] In these progressions, Preindl adopts the same procedure of substituting \nchromatic for diatonic pitches so as to lead the harmony to the new key. This entails \na rapid chromatic alteration of the diatonic model in scales that terminate in keys \nwith many accidentals, and a more leisurely alteration in keys with fewer inflections. \nIn extreme instances, such as Example 9, the rapid chromatic alteration implies \na concept of modulation with chromatic pivot chords (as if, for example, the downbeat \nwere a chromatic chord in the key of the second bar). But no pivot-chord relationship \nis addressed here, and the scalar frame remains the explicit point of reference. [3.5.2.4] Chromatic alteration of a patterned octave descent (a variation of \nthe time-honored “rule of the octave”) is a particularly clear modulatory guideline \nor Wegweiser . Why Preindl should choose specific embellishment patterns—such \nas 2 to —is never explained, however. Presumably the student is left to devise \nother embellishment patterns by using basic modulating scale models and adapting \npatterns of suspension and anticipation introduced earlier in the treatise. In his \nfavor, one notes again the economy of Preindl’s scale-based presentation: let the \nbass descend by step; add chromatic alterations so as to move into the scale of \nthe target key. Example 10 (click to enlarge) Example 11 (click to enlarge) Example 12 (click to enlarge) [3.5.3] Bass in ascending octave scales; pages 166–68 and page 169; 8 progressions. \nThese progressions take various patterned forms: with suspended sevenths, seconds, \nand ninths; with the bass in conjunct motion or broken with a pattern of leaping \nthirds; or simply as alternating root-position and first-inversion chords. Several \nmodels are presented [one of which is Example 10 {167}]. Again, in some rapid chromatic alterations \nchromatic pivot chords are implicit, as in the first measure of a modulation to \nA major, where Preindl adds a gratuitous C-sharp in the bass on beat 3 (gratuitous \nsince the pattern established on the third beats of subsequent bars does not call \nfor this alteration) [ Example 11 , \n{168}]. The scalar frame, however, remains the patent frame of reference. [3.5.4] Bass in ascending fifths and descending fourths; pages 168–69; 2 progressions. \nThe bass follows a pattern of an ascending fifth followed by a descending fourth, \nwhile the upper voices move largely by descending conjunct motion, with suspended \nfourths. [3.5.5] Bass in descending thirds and ascending seconds; pages 170–71; 6 progressions. \nAs Preindl describes the model: If the bass voice falls by the leap of a third, then one can put a root-position \n  triad on every downbeat and a or chord on the upbeat. [Wenn die Grundstimme in Terz-Sprüngen herabsteigt, so kann man auf jedem Niederstreich \n  einen reinen Dreyklang, im Auftact aber reinen Terz-Sexten, oder Quint-Sexten-Accord \n  anbringen.]{169–70} To his diatonic model he adds a variation with suspended ninths resolving over \nthe change of harmony [ Example 12 , \n{171}]. [3.5.6] Bass in descending octave scales; pages 171–72; 2 progressions. Bass and \nsoprano descend an octave through a pattern of 7-6 suspensions. [3.5.7] Bass in descending fifths and ascending fourths; page 172; 2 progressions. \nPaired suspensions in upper voices produce a chain of sevenths. [3.5.8] In summary (to answer our first question “How should a figured-bass treatise \naccount for modulation?”), the first part of Preindl’s chapter on modulation offers \na set of bass patterns, formulaic figured-bass progressions. Their model or template \nforms are built of diatonic scales. Their modulating forms introduce accidentals \ninto the diatonic models so as to lead to the keys of the modulations. These chromatic \nscalar patterns can be altered further through extension or truncation to suit the \nneeds of an individual modulation. As modulatory guideposts, they accord with the \ninterval patterns introduced earlier in the treatise in the discussion of key signatures. \nMoreover, their framework is in keeping with the figured-bass aspect of Preindl’s \ntreatise, since the treatise introduces nothing essentially new into the figured-bass \nformulation and yet remains relatively complete and self-sufficient. In essence, \nPreindl’s patterned-bass signposts work, without leaving us wondering about the \ncompleteness of their formulation. The same cannot be said about his second approach.",

                "text": "[3.6] Chromatic pivot-chord modulations [3.6.1] The modulations appearing now in the treatise mark a sudden change in \nPreindl’s conception, away from modulatory bass patterns to single chromatic chords \noperating like pivots. Of these, two general categories can be discerned. Example 13 (click to enlarge) [3.6.2] The bass moves up by half step; pages 172–73; 3 progressions. Preindl describes \nthe rising half-step modulation as follows: If the bass rises by a half step, then one can proceed directly to the next \n  key a whole step above by means of a chord [see Example 13 , {172}]. [Wenn der Baß um einen halben Ton steigt, so kann man mit einem Quint-Sext-Accorde \n  unmittelbar in die nächste Tonart der großen Secunde gelangen.]{172} For a theorist equipped with the modern tools of pivot chords, this example is \nbreathtaking. Gone are the lengthy scale-patterned models of the previous examples, \nto be replaced with a simple pivot-chord formulation. The lengthy (and thus clumsy) \nframework of the scale framework is jettisoned for a compact pivot conception. [3.6.3] Entirely missing, however, is an explanation of the familiar pivot-chord \nprinciple at work here. Preindl’s examples are merely instances; they are not exhaustive \nor self-contained but rather the single outcomes of a larger overarching conception \nconspicuously absent from his treatise. A true Harmonielehre would explain \nthe implicit logic behind this example: that the chord in question is the inversion \nof an applied chord in the old key and is treated as a dominant chord in the new \nkey. It would, for instance, be noted that the same direct progression to the next \nkey [ unmittelbar in die nächste Tonart ] could be established with the chord \nin root position, rather than the , or in any other inversion. Preindl’s emphasis, \nhowever, is on the pattern. A Harmonielehre would subordinate the pattern \nto a logic of chordal-root relation. Preindl, however, teaches only patterns and \nthen leaves the student to extrapolate from these guideposts. Without the supplement \nof a Harmonielehre , that would be a difficult task. [3.6.4] Preindl’s second category of chromatic pivot-chord modulations involve \na stationary bass, and he describes three such models: Example 14 (click to enlarge) Example 15 (click to enlarge) Example 16 (click to enlarge) [3.6.4.1] The bass remains stationary to become the fifth of a 6/4/3 chord; page \n173; 3 progressions. In modern terms the chord in question is the V of the new \nkey, which prepares a modulation down a major second [ Example 14 , {173}]. [3.6.4.2] The bass remains stationary to become the third of a 6/5/3 chord; page \n173; 6 progressions. The modulatory chord is V , which prepares a modulation up \na minor second [ Example 15 , {173}]. [3.6.4.3] The bass remains stationary and above it are added a minor third, an \naugmented fourth, and a major sixth; page 175; 4 progressions. The modulatory chord \nis a diminished , which is approached and resolved with a complexity not seen \nbefore in the treatise. Preindl explains it as follows, and illustrates with a progression \nthat modulates from C major to B major: Through the dissonant 6 chord, with a minor third and augmented fourth, one \n  can fall a half tone, but the chord that follows immediately must be held out \n  so as to emphasize the new root and to render the ear sensitive to the new and \n  unexpected harmony [ Example 16 , {175}]. [Durch den dissonirenden Sext-Accord, mit der kleinen Terz und übermäßigen \n  Quarte kann man um einen halben ton herabsteigen; jedoch muß der nächstfolgende \n  Accord verlängert werden, um den neuen Grundton vorzubereiten, und das Gehör für \n  den unerwarteten Harmonie-Wechsel empfänglich zu machen.]{174–5} The modulation relies upon an initial spelling of the 6/4/3 chord as a diminished \nseventh applied to the chord of ♭ VI in the new key of B major (C, E-flat, F-sharp, \nA). By moving the bass down a semitone and respelling E-flat enharmonically, Preindl \ntransforms this into an altered I chord, with seventh added to become V 7 /IV (with \nquite remarkable voice leading between tenor and soprano). Implicit is the Mehrdeutigkeit of the diminished seventh chord as dominant seventh, but Preindl makes no mention \nof this principle. Curious as well is the fact that he refers to the new Grundton , \nthe bass note, whereas he might have made matters clearer had he drawn attention \nto a new Grundbaß , or the chordal root. [3.6.5] Unlike the patterned-bass approach, this second, implicitly pivot-chord \napproach seems dramatically incomplete, lacking the explanatory concept of a chordal \nroot capable of registration through Mehrdeutigkeit in two keys. Admittedly \nthe bias we bring—that of the Harmonielehre —may prejudice our appraisal \nunfairly. But given the compact formulation of this second category of examples, \nand the apparent lack of a precedent in figured-bass practice, this second approach \nseems anomalous, both in terms of Preindl’s first approach and figured-bass practice \nin general.

The benefit of Preindl’s scalar \nbass patterns to the student, especially the student faced with creating “preambles” \nand “fantasies,” is clear: learning to improvise a few patterns of this sort, like \nlearning to read a figured bass, is a finite skill, to be applied where requisite. \nBut why did Preindl include pivot-chord like modulations, especially in such an \nincomplete manner? No doubt individual pivot patterns, like bass patterns, can be \nplugged in as needed. It would be far more useful, however, to teach the principle \nof chromatic pivots, and then let the student create the patterns, since the applications \nare manifold. Did he really think of pivot-chord modulation in a patterned way? \nOr was he was only just coming to know the work of his northern counterparts, such \nas Vogler or Weber and could not countenance completely the mind shift—from pattern \nto formula—that the northern theory entailed? Do we read in Preindl’s treatise, \nthen, an incomplete coming to terms with this new conception? The question “why \nmodulation in a figured-bass treatise?” in this regard is not so easily answered \n(especially when asked in the Viennese context of Schenkerian theory). (9)",

From examining Preindl’s \ntreatise, however, we might say that a figured-bass treatise should not aim to teach \nmodulation through the use of short pivot-chord patterns. It should not do so, at \nleast, without some supplementary explanation of chordal roots and pivotal relationships \nin two keys, which would begin to make it more a Harmonielehre than a Generalbaßlehre . Which is why and how Preindl’s anomalous treatise—with its Anweisung both zum Generalbaße and zur Harmonie —is curiously \nincomplete when it comes to modulation. (10)",
