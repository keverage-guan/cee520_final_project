                "text": "[1] In light of the number of articles on \ntransformational harmony appearing recently in scholarly journals, one might \nexpect a book of this title to be a full-blown study in what has come to be \ncalled “neo-Riemannian” theory. Instead, however, it is a view of harmony based \non a transformational system of the author’s own invention. And while he \nacknowledges some indebtedness to the work of other theorists, David Kopp’s \nspecific goal is to account for and incorporate chromatic mediant relations \nwithin a functional system that is applicable to nineteenth-century harmonic \npractice. His notion of “functional” does not rely on traditional categories of \ntonic, dominant and subdominant chords and their syntactic roles within harmonic \nprogressions; nor does he focus on diatonic scale degrees and the harmonies \nbuilt on them, as in Roman-numeral analysis. Rather, Kopp defines functions as \ntransformations between chords sharing one or more common tones. In these \nrespects, his work is distinctive. [2] In the book’s first chapter, which follows a thoughtful \nforward by Ian Bent, Kopp identifies the common-tone relationships that comprise \nhis transformational system and examines in particular the role of chromatic \nmediants. Unlike definitions in other sources, which often include third-related \ntriads that share no pitch classes (e.g., C major and E flat minor), Kopp \nappropriately limits his “chromatic mediant” designation to those with one \ncommon tone. The second chapter illustrates and discusses the use of chromatic \nmediants in three pieces by Schubert, and is the first of several such \npresentations that contribute to the book’s cogency by presenting the author’s \nviews in relevant musical contexts. [3] The next four chapters examine the treatment of third \nrelations by theorists from Rameau through the twentieth century, with the \nheaviest emphasis on the work of Hugo Riemann. Although this material is \nimpressive in scope as well as in attention to detail, it also seems a largely \nunnecessary and overly long digression from the author’s primary objective. This \nforay into the often-quirky quagmire of the history of theory makes up nearly \nforty percent of the book and forms a kind of barrier between the presentation \nof ideas in the opening chapters and their subsequent development. Here, most \nreaders would likely prefer one or two chapters that focus more specifically on \nways in which contemporary theoretical approaches (i.e., functional, \nSchenkerian, and neo-Riemannian) deal with chromatic mediants, and that point to \nthe need for a more musically enlightened alternative. Table 1 . Kopp’s Triadic Transformation Types (click to enlarge) [4] In Chapter 7, Kopp returns to his own ideas of harmonic \nprogression defined as triadic transformations, and presents a system based on \nthe common-tone relationships identified in Chapter 1. Table 1 lists these \nthirteen transformations, which are characterized according to root movement and \nwhether triad quality (i.e., major or minor mode) is retained or changed. \nChapter 8 explores, through the use of brief examples from the \nnineteenth-century repertoire, occurrences of these transformations as harmonic \nmechanisms and examines their roles in various musical situations. This chapter \nuses score notation with transformations labeled, as well as network diagrams, \nto address in detail what Kopp sees as the “functional” nature of these \nprogressions. The processes defined here serve the same general purpose as \nfunctional designations in traditional, diatonically oriented approaches to \nharmonic syntax in that they attempt to convey information about the relatedness \nof chords and the musical effect of different types of progressions. The final \nchapter presents five analyses that apply the transformational system and \nmechanisms explored in Chapters 7 and 8 to complete pieces. Because Chapters 7–9 \ncarry the essential content of the study, I will consider them more carefully \nhere. [5] Readers familiar with transformational theory will recognize \nsome important similarities and differences between Kopp’s transformations and \nthose of other theorists inspired by Riemann’s prevenient efforts, notably David \nLewin, Brian Hyer, and Richard Cohn. (Since the relevant studies are well \ndocumented by Kopp, I will omit specific citations here.) The P transformation is common to all these systems. S is from Lewin. The R transformation is the same as Riemann’s L ( Leittonwechsel ), which \nis retained by Cohn and other neo-Riemannian theorists, whereas Riemann’s R (Relative) becomes a lower-case r in Kopp’s system. D is a \nRiemannian function discussed also by Hyer, but eschewed by Cohn because it can \nbe expressed as a compound of what he considers to be more basic functions, R plus L . These differences point up the most distinctive feature of Kopp’s \nsystem, which is its consistent expression of connections between chords sharing \nat least one common tone as unary transformations. Neo-Riemannian theory, by \ncontrast, favors a smaller number of transformation types, and uses compound \nexpressions more freely. [6] The primacy of common-tone connections in Kopp’s system is \ntied to his ideas about chord functions, in particular with regard to the role \nof chromatic mediants ( M and m ). In the more traditional view of \nharmonic function, a direct chromatic-mediant juxtaposition is normally regarded \nas a non-functional, or tonally disruptive, event. In Schenkerian theory, such \nprogressions must be absorbed into a larger harmonic motion, usually toward the \ndominant, and the chromatic mediant chord, instead of being understood as a \nharmony in its own right, is explained as an inflection of some diatonic \nharmony. And as important as chromatic mediant relationships are in \nneo-Riemannian theory, here too they lack independent standing in that they are \ninterpreted, like D , as compound transformations ( PL or RP for roots descending a major or minor third, respectively). The principal \nadvantage of Kopp’s approach, then, is the treatment of these characteristic \nnineteenth-century harmonic events as completely intelligible and coherent tonal \nrelationships that deserve to be on equal footing with other common-tone \nprogressions, diatonic or chromatic, such as D , F , R and r . Many of the musical examples discussed in Chapter 8 make a strong and \nconvincing case for this argument; thus for anyone sensitive to the special role \nof chromatic mediant progressions in this repertoire, Kopp’s ideas are likely to \nhave considerable intuitive appeal. Example 1 . Common-tone augmented sixth and diminished seventh chords (click to enlarge) [7] As successful as Kopp is in legitimizing chromatic mediants \nas tonally functional entities, his transformational system nevertheless fails \nto address a number of issues. If in fact he proposes that common-tone functions \nrepresent a more-or-less self-sufficient means for conducting meaningful \nharmonic analysis, there are some nagging questions that need answers. Foremost \namong the issues that confront all transformational harmonic theory is the \nchoice of objects, or chord types, that make up the system. Kopp’s system is \nbased on consonant (major and minor) triads. (This was also the case in \nneo-Riemannian theory at first, but more recent studies have begun to \nconcentrate on seventh chords as well.) It cannot account for diminished or \naugmented triads, despite the larger role these sonorities assume in \nnineteenth-century music. Because Kopp treats sevenths as appendages to triads, \nseventh chords have no independent standing, and only those containing a \nconsonant triad (especially the dominant seventh) are included. The system does \nnot deal with diminished sevenths at all, and one is left to wonder whether, for \nexample, a half-diminished seventh might be considered as a minor triad with a \nRameau-esque “subposed” root. There are not compelling musical reasons why \ncertain chords have a place in the system, whereas chords of similar \nconstruction or usage do not. The German augmented sixth, for instance, is in, \nbecause it has the same pitch-class content as a dominant seventh, but the \nFrench sixth is out. The dominant seventh with raised fifth is also out, even \nthough its resolution is typically similar to that of the dominant seventh. \nConsider especially the relationship between the two situations given in Example 1 , the so-called “common-tone augmented sixth” and “common-tone diminished \nseventh.” In terms of voice leading, they represent only slightly different \nversions of the same phenomenon; but again, only the former one has a place in \nKopp’s chromatic system, and indeed figures prominently in his analysis of \nWolf’s In der Frühe , as the progression that connects the two contrasting \nhalves of the song. [8] Another set of issues pertains to the application of the \nsystem in an analytic method that identifies transformations both in direct \nsuccessions and in long-range harmonic relationships. Kopp’s analyses sometimes \nprioritize chord-to-chord movement, and at other times focus on larger-scale \nharmonic designs. In the latter case, his analysis of Chopin’s Mazurka, Op. 56 \nNo. 1 (pages 235–40) is extraordinary in its revelation of an overall scheme in \nwhich a number of distantly-related tonalities are organized around the tonic as \na symmetrical network of transformations. It is unlikely that any other approach \ncould express this design more efficiently. At other times (e.g., the analysis \nof Liszt’s Consolation No. 3, pages 240–6), Kopp considers different views of \nharmonic structure based on different chord groupings. His multi-level thinking \nimparts analytical flexibility, but since there are no rules within the model \nitself that help to determine which relationships hold greater import or \nprimacy, he is left to justify his choices somewhat informally, in terms of \nmusical context. [9] Kopp’s inherently musical perspective and intimate knowledge of the \nrepertoire contribute as much to the success of the analyses as his \ntransformational system, suggesting that the system is perhaps of greatest \nbenefit when it can be incorporated into a multi-faceted view of musical \nstructure. Wherever the analyses fall short, it is attributable to the fact that \na hegemonistic harmonic orientation drives the analysis, consigning factors like \nmelody and voice leading to a subsidiary role. As an illustration, consider \nSchubert’s Die junge Nonne, which is the final work examined in Chapter 9 (pages 254–63). The harmonic design of this song is remarkable in several respects, and \nKopp’s claim that “notions of mediant function help to clarify the nature of \nharmony and musical meaning” (page 254) is correct as far as it goes. I propose, \nhowever, that in this work harmony and melody are equal partners in the musical \nstructure and in the formation of relationships between music and text. [10] Kopp divides the song into an introduction (mm. 1-8) and four stanzas (measures 9–34, 34–50, 51–61, and 62–92). Although he does not give an overview of the \ntext (by Craigher), it would be helpful to the discussion. The young nun begins \nby describing a storm raging outside her window in the first stanza; then in \nstanza two she compares the storm to her life at an earlier time. In the third \nstanza she speaks of her recently acquired peace and spiritual freedom. The \nclimax comes at the beginning of stanza four, where she calls for Christ to come \nand “take his bride.” The tension abates thereafter, and the song concludes with \na serene “Alleluja” passage. [11] In Schubert’s setting, the first two stanzas are similar, beginning and \nending in F minor. The last two are in F major, reflecting the text’s change of \nmood. More striking harmonic relationships exist within the stanzas, especially \nin the tonal scheme. The first two stanzas move from F minor to F sharp minor \nbefore returning to the home key; the third stanza introduces some direct \nchromatic mediant progressions (C7 to A and A to F7), but the next strong \ntonicization is D flat major at the beginning of stanza four. Kopp’s analysis \nconcentrates on the shift from R and D progressions in the first part of the \nsong to chromatic third relations that emerge in the F major portion, \nculminating in a climactic M transformation from F to D flat (measure 63). His \ndiscussion includes correspondences between harmonic progressions and ideas in \nthe text, and concludes by exploring how various melodic progressions in the \nvocal line directed toward high F operate within the harmonic structure. Example 2 . Melodic-harmonic cross-references in Schubert’s Die junge Nonne (click to enlarge) [12] Example 2 offers what I believe is a useful expansion of Kopp’s view of \nthis song. The first graph (Example 2a) shows the opening vocal line (measures 10–11) \nmoving from F to its first melodic goal, D flat, that arrives with the first \nchange of harmony. The voice’s next entrance is a sequential restatement (measures 18–19) in F sharp minor that pushes the D flat up to D natural before the \ntonality returns to F minor at the end of the stanza. The second graph (Example \n2b) is the vocal phrase at the beginning of the fourth stanza, where Schubert \nsets the climactic words “take your bride” with an ascent to the melodic zenith \nof the song (G flat) that is the seventh of V7 and that resolves to F \nconcomitantly with the authentic cadence on D flat. The example indicates \nconspicuous cross-references between melodic details and larger harmonic \nrelationships that link the beginning of the song with its climax. The initial \nmove from F to D flat in the voice is expressed also by the harmonic shift from \nF to D flat in measure 63 and the cadence in measure 65; also at this \ncadence-point, the pitch classes of the tonal scheme in the opening of the song \nappear as a melodic gesture emphasizing the high G flat. This exchange of \nmelodic and harmonic events suggests that both carry equivalent weight as \ndeterminants of structure in the song, but Kopp’s harmonically-privileged \napproach cannot fully engage these important tonal processes. Another such \nmelodic-harmonic process involves the conflict Schubert sets up between the two \nforms of the submediant, D flat and D natural. Both pitch classes occur in \nvarious contexts throughout the song (beginning with their functions in the keys \nof F minor and F sharp minor, as shown in Example 2a), but there is a \nlarge-scale conversion of D natural from the lowered submediant in F sharp to \nthe diatonic submediant in F major within the “Alleluja” at the end, which \nparallels the progression of ideas in the text. [13] The book is written in an intelligent and straightforward style, and the \nlayout, including tables and illustrations, is clear and legible. The text is \nhighly accurate, but there are problems with a few of the illustrations. Figure \n1.6 (page 12) for instance, incorrectly identifies C major to B flat minor as a \nmediant relationship; Example 2.1b (page 19) is not the score excerpt to which the \ndiscussion refers; the clef and key signature for Figure 8.3 (page 197) are \nincorrect; and the climactic G flat in Die junge Nonne (measure 65) discussed above \nis shown as a G natural in Figure 9.12 (page 257). [14] Kopp’s Chromatic Transformations is an ambitious study, particularly \neffective in its treatment of chromatic mediant relations. It successfully \nbuilds a new transformational system from Riemannian roots, yet offers an \nintriguing alternative to current neo-Riemannian theory. Despite certain \nlimitations associated with the analytic method, Kopp’s system proves to be \nuseful in elucidating aspects of harmonic structure. The book stands as an \nimportant contribution to the study of nineteenth-century harmony from a \ntransformational perspective.",
