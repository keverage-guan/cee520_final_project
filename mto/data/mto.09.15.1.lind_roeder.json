    "abstract": "Berg’s “Schlafend trägt man mich,” the second song of his Vier Lieder Op. 2, is often understood to reflect the transition between the composer’s tonal and free atonal periods. This paper summarizes previous analyses that treat voice leading, transpositional invariance, and the behavior of the “French 6th” chords in the piece. It then shows how to unify those observations in the context of a particular transformational space that provides additional insights into the form and process of the song. Animations illustrate how the song’s themes of distance and return are manifested by the progression of the music through this space.",

Situated at the intersection of Berg’s tonal and free atonal periods ( Simms 1992 , 490; Straus 2005 , 125), the work eschews functional tonality but does not yet incorporate the twelve-tone methods that characterize his later music. Op. 2 as a whole is considered by many to reflect this stylistic transition because the first song is in a tonal idiom, and each subsequent song progressively incorporates more atonal elements ( Headlam 1996 , 33–34). Thus “Schlafend trägt man mich” has been of particular interest to theorists; substantial analyses that informed the present analysis include writings by Ayrey ( 1982 ), Kett ( 1989 ), Simms ( 1992 ), Headlam ( 1996 ), Gauldin ( 1999 ), and most recently Straus ( 2005 ).",

Several key analytical points will be illustrated via animation, a medium that has the advantage of presenting an analysis temporally as a conjunction of aural and spatial sequences. Given the song’s textual emphasis on the ideas of distance and motion, this medium is especially appropriate, since it can manifest these metaphors visually. New perspectives on the work’s text/music relationships, chord progressions, harmonic rhythm, and voice leadings derive from a consideration of the divergences and convergences of transformational paths in the space.

Clearly, “much of the second song . . . is concerned with exploiting the structural and cyclic possibilities inherent in the French 6th chord” ( Jarman 2001 , 314). We will henceforth refer to it by its set-class name, 0268, rather than as a “French Sixth,” since the opening of the work conspicuously lacks the major or minor chords, traditional chord progressions, and normative resolutions of the French \nSixths that could denote functional tonality. (As will become clear shortly, however, we do think it is significant that most instances of 0268 in this song preserve the major third above the bass that is characteristic of the French Sixth.) (1) The presence or absence of 0268 helps to define formal sections, creating an ABA' form ( Headlam 1996 , 41): measures 1–8 present the first progression featuring 0268, measures 9–12 present contrasting material alluding to other tonal chords, and measures 13–18 reprise the initial 0268 progression.

The A section divides into two subsections, the first corresponding to the opening vocal phrase (measures 1–4), and the second to the piano transition between this and the next line of text (measures 4–8). In the first vocal phrase, a series of 0268 tetrachords alternate between the two whole-tone collections, starting and ending on the same pc set, {B , D, E, A } ( Straus 2005 , 125–127). Also important are the voice leadings of the upper and lower parts: the bass moves by interval class (ic) 5, while motion by ic1 is prominent in the upper voices ( Ayrey 1982 , 190 and 197–199; Simms 1992 , 494; Headlam 1996 , 33–34; Gauldin 1999 , 34–36.). The piano transition retrogrades the opening chord progression ( Jarman 2001 , 314) beginning in measure 4, concluding the opening ascending motion on a second instance of the initial pc set {B , D, E, A }. Ic1 and ic5 voice leadings continue in this subsection ( Ayrey 1982 , 192–193; Headlam 1996 , 41), and the bass is now doubled at the major third above. The 0268 chords and their associated voice leading are abandoned at the end of the piano transition (measure 8).",

We can also use the same criteria of repetition to determine which transformations are characteristic of the music.  In the first phrase, the pitch-class intervals 5 and 1, \nwhich repeatedly connect members of these tetrachords in the bass and upper voices, respectively, can be represented transformationally as the transpositions T 5 and T 11 , and accordingly, the retrograde progression of the second phrase presents the transpositions T 7 and T 1 in the voice leading. The transpositions featured in upper and lower voices are indicated above and below the slurs on Figure 3 , a reduction of the A and A' sections (based on Gauldin 1999 , 35). (2)",

The space surveyed from two sides in Figures 4a and 4b incorporates these objects and transformations (note that 7e15 on the right side of the front view is the same node as that on the left of the rear view, and vice-versa with 157e).  Its 24 nodes represent a doubling of the 12 distinct partially ordered 0268 objects described in [3.2], an interpretive decision that will be rationalized below. Each node is located at the intersection of two axes, which represent the transpositions T 5 /T 7 ( red ; \ncounterclockwise and clockwise, respectively) and T 11 /T 1 ( blue ; also \ncounterclockwise and clockwise, respectively). From any node, one can move by T 5 , T 7 , T 11 , and T 1 .  We will use color in the text when referring to these transformations to clarify their association with the colored paths in the figures. The toroidal shape of the space expresses the fact that ( T 5 ) 12 = ( T 11 ) 12 = T 0 , cyclically generating all 12 partially ordered objects, and the multiple intersecting paths account for the fact that ( T 5 ) 2 = ( T 11 ) 2 = T 10 (the divergence of paths accounts for the fact that T 5 and T 11 produce different results when applied only once). Black and red arrows on the figures orient the viewer respectively to one particular node, \nlabeled t248, and to another node, labeled with the T 6 transposition 48t2, that is also located on the top of the torus but in the rear, across its major axis.

Sometimes the voice leading is uniform. Chord-changes in which all voices move by the same interval, such as at the end of the first system of Figure 3, measures 7–8, correspond to motion from one node to another along just one axis, in this case from t248 \ncounterclockwise and downward along the blue axis to 9137.  But other voice leadings are more complicated and so give rise to more complex representations of chords. For example, from the opening tetrachord t248, the bass voice changes by T 5 , while the upper parts change by T 11 . The resulting chord can therefore be conceived both as T 5 and as T 11 of t248, that is as both 3791 and 9137. Accordingly, we conceive of the second chord as represented by both nodes immediately \ncounterclockwise (to the right in Figure 4a) from t248; the node 3791 is gained by following the red T 5 path, and the node 9137 is gained by following the blue T 11 path.

Recall, however, that the two motions are representing different voices in the counterpoint. To be consistent, we should read the 9137 chord achieved by the bass voice leading as changing again by T 5 , once more representing the bass motion.  It does not change simultaneously by T 11 . Similarly, we should read the 3791 chord achieved by the upper-part voice leading as changing again by T 11 , once more representing the upper-part motion.  It does not change simultaneously by T 5 . These two paths ( T 5 from 9137 and T 11 from 3719) converge on 2680, which we therefore adopt as the sole representative of the third chord.

Each move has direction and speed , helping to identify reversals, rhythmically regular points of synchronization, and changes in harmonic rhythm. The circularity of the torus suggests a possible return to the beginning by completing a progression (of twelve moves in the same direction along each axis). Also, as Figure 5 shows, the six partially-ordered tetrachords that lie at the intersections of the outer blue and top red paths, {48t2, 6t04, 8026, t248, 046t, 2680}, all belong to the same whole-tone collection, {02468t}. Similarly, the six tetrachords at the intersections of the outer blue and bottom red axes belong to the other whole-tone collection.

By asserting completion so soon, it makes it difficult to explain what motivates the continuation of the song. Instead, we hear the repeated voice-leading in measures 1–4 to suggest the possibility of continuing the same pattern six more times back to its start, t248. And when that process is disrupted by the change of voice leading in measure 4, we hear the promise of completion—and thus the possibility of more music—still open.  The presence of two 48t2 nodes in the 24-node space, one of which is visually distant from the opening t248, makes it possible to represent that openness vividly. Another feature of the music that the 12-node space obscures is audible association of chords that belong to the same whole-tone collection, through, for instance, the agogic and metrical emphasis mentioned above.  It is difficult to see on the 12-node space how the opening progression alternates between the two whole-tone scales. In contrast, the 24-node space makes the whole-tone collections visually apparent; these whole-tone collections provide an orientation that we have found to be helpful for understanding some of the events in the piece.

During its first chord change in measure 4, the piano breaks the established pattern of T 5 motion in the bass, as the E2 slides up chromatically to F2 (this surprising T 1 motion is marked on Figure 3 ). With some rearrangement of register, the other voices can also be heard to change by T 1 . (6) Therefore, the animation of this progression shows the 48t2 chord progressing along only by T 1 , downwards and clockwise to 59e3, with no simultaneous change by T 7 . From 59e3 (starting at 0:22), the piano retrogrades the opening pc-set progression, arranging the chords in register and time such that we can again hear both ic 1 and ic 5 motion in the bass. \nSo the animation resumes showing the chord changes along both axes, directed clockwise back towards the starting chord. Note, however, that it touches upon two versions of each chord from the even-pc whole-tone collection—exactly the opposite of how the original chord progression behaved, so that the nodes that were avoided in the first vocal phrase are now visited by the piano. (7) It is as if these new chords make possible the undoing of the opening progression.  Accordingly, when the opening 0268 collection is regained at the downbeat of measure 7 (at 0:30), its bass note is not the original B , but E, a long-range consequence of the disruptive T 1 shift in measure 4. The T 7 even pushes the piano’s progression one point beyond the starting chord, venturing into the half of the space not yet explored by the music.",

Nevertheless, it does recall the common transformations, intervals, and melodic motives from measures 1–8.  For example, in measures 9–10, the voice sings a melody \nwhich was first heard as the upper line of the accompaniment in measures 1–3, and immediately sequences it by T 11 (a characteristic transformation among 0268 tetrachords in the A section) during measures 11–12. This is indicated on Figure 7. The piano accompaniment of measures 8–12 echoes this melody in its inner voices, but also incorporates materials from the opening vocal phrase ( Headlam 1996 , 43). \nTwo transpositions of this material are identified on Figure 7: the right hand of measure 9 is transposed by T 3 to produce the right hand of measure 11 (indicated in black), and the right hand of measure 10 is transposed by T 4 to produce the right hand of measure 12 (indicated in gray). Although these transformations are not those heard between tetrachords in Animation 1 , T 4 does nonetheless occur prominently in several ways: it generates the left-hand melodic dyads in measures 4–6, and also the left-hand simultaneous dyads in measures 7–8, which continue in measures 8–12.

The prominence of T 4 suggests constructing another transformational system in which the 12 ordered 04 dyads are the objects.

Thus, the B section reprises transformational motions that are characteristic of the A and A' sections, but applies them to different objects. By observing these transpositions in this particular space, we can also recognize allusions to the larger harmonic structures of the outer sections.  For example, 48 and t2, which appear as the third and fifth dyads in the first progression of six, are aligned with each other laterally on the torus (that is, the 48 appears at the crest of a T 11 wave on the outside of the torus and t2 appears at the trough of the corresponding T 11 wave on the inside of the torus).

Also—and unlike in the B section—only the characteristic T 11 / T 1 and T 5 / T 7 moves are executed in the A and A' dyad spaces. In this sense, we might understand the piano accompaniment to be the agent that is “bearing” the singer towards her homeland. At first, the dyad and tetrachord motions can be heard as consistent and identical at each moment. Later, however, this is not the case. For instance, at the beginning of the A' section, from beat 2 to beat 3 in measure 14, a tetrachord changes by T 11 into the next, but the voice’s dyad transforms by T 7 to the next. Perhaps this “departure” from synchronization indicates some resistance on the singer’s part. Thereafter, however, the song ends with a rhythmic and transformational synchronization of the two object types: in the final three measures (16–18), both the piano (featuring 0268 tetrachords) and the voice (featuring 04 dyads) are transposed by T 11 , following a single blue path along the torus in each animation.  This resynchronization enacts another kind of “return.” Conclusion",

They distinguish within Berg’s song two types of characteristic objects, 0268 tetrachords and 04 dyads. Of course, the two object types are related, since 0268 can be understood as the union of two 04 dyads. But the contrast between them helps articulate the formal boundaries between the A and B sections, as dyads take over the musical surface. On the other hand, the animations show that the contrast is not stark. The whole-tone intervals in the tetrachord objects become the transformations between the dyad objects, and the dyads progress through the toroidal space in a way that alludes to 0268s, suggesting hidden connections between the two types of material.",

It also shows in what specific sense we might hear the progression, in the absence of tonality, to evoke “distance.” Animation 2 of the B section shows an interesting contrast in this respect. It begins with a somewhat static progression that alternates among a small number of nodes. This dramatizes the contradiction between distance and return embodied in the text: the A sections traverse a considerable distance within the space, but the B section returns to previously explored areas.
