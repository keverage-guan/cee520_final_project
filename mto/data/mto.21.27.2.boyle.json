    "abstract": "Repetition in the music of pianist/composer Craig Taborn engenders diverse temporal experiences at both local and global scales. At the local level, distinctive repetitions that I termflexible ostinatishare significant features with the cyclic materials often observed in groove-based musics: they comprise a repetitive, omnipresent stream within the overall texture, provide a rapid isochronous pulse, and imply higher-level metric levels. However, they differ from strict ostinati or the repetitions that Anne Danielsen (2006) terms “basic groove units” in their flexibility at the rhythmic/metric level of temporal experience. This flexibility manifests in two ways: in the material domain, flexible ostinati are often varied significantly across repetitions, while in the interpretive domain, they simultaneously suggest multiple possibilities for pulse, meter, or cyclic beginning/ending. Following Danielsen, who describes groove as emerging from interactions between sounding rhythm and a reference structure, I examine the potential reference structures (meter and cycle) suggested by Taborn’s flexible ostinati. These structures are never fixed, but instead must be constantly negotiated, resulting in engaging grooves that draw the listener into the music’s temporal matrix. I analyze three pieces from Taborn’s 2011 solo album,Avenging Angel,to demonstrate how, across longer stretches of time, diverse forms grow out of these ostinati: “The Broad Day King” layers a surface-level flexible ostinato against slower background cycles that gradually reveal themselves; “Avenging Angel” is structured by the juxtaposition of two contrasting ostinati; and a brief passage in “Neverland” features an elusive groove that dissolves almost as soon as it materializes.",

On (2), Danielsen ( 2006 , 192) writes, “There is no distancing from the musical events: one is continuously engaged in the coproduction of gestures; there is a total presence in the groove. Time dissolves. Repetition never becomes repetitive.” Keil’s ( [1966] 1994 ; [1987] 1994 ) foundational theorization of groove emphasizes musical performance over notation, and the idea that groove involves expert performance is common to the use of the term by jazz musicians, as in the testimonials in Monson ( [1996] 2009 ).",

In an update to Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s rule system, Temperley ( 2001 , 358) adds a rule (his MPR 6) that aligns beat onsets with harmonic changes. While meter and grouping are normally understood as two separate (if interconnected) ways of segmenting musical time, the two processes are difficult to disentangle when listening to Ostinato 2. See Lerdahl and Jackendoff ( [1983] 1996 , 12–35) on the difference between meter and grouping, and Berry ( 1987 , 317–18) for an alternative view of meter as grouping. In the case of Ostinato 2, the potential collapse of grouping and meter into a single perceptual category is supported by its avoidance of conventional means of articulating meter, as well as by its strict repetition, which aids in making its complex rhythms entrainable. Butler ( 2006 , 129) describes a similar blurring of the boundary between meter and grouping in the case of repeating grooves in electronic dance music.",

More recent collaborative work by London, Rainer Polak, and others ( Polak and London 2014 ; Polak 2018 ) suggests that these constraints may not be universal; among other things, they identify in some repertoire NI cycles at multiple hierarchical levels and NI cycles at the subtactus level which are not defined by simple integer ratios.

                "text": "[1.1] Recently, music scholarship has shown a renewed interest in repetition (e.g., Margulis 2014 ; Butler 2014 ). One burgeoning area is the analysis of how popular music’s “grooves”—short cyclic materials that repeat continuously throughout a piece or section—create a song’s unique temporal feel and participate in or subvert larger formal processes and structures ( Hughes 2003 ; Danielsen 2006 ; Butler 2006 ; Attas 2015 ; Danielsen 2018 ). Research on rhythmic feel or “groove” in jazz has traditionally focused more on microrhythmic analysis and/or player interaction than on overt pattern repetition, but cyclic and quasi-cyclic repetition can play as important a role in jazz as it does in other African-American genres such as funk ( Logan 1984 ). The music of contemporary jazz pianist/composer Craig Taborn provides many examples. Below I analyze three pieces from Taborn’s 2011 solo album, Avenging Angel, to show how distinctive repetitions, which I term flexible ostinati, engender diverse groove experiences and underscore larger formal processes. Definitions and Context Craig Taborn, Avenging Angel , and Analysis of Improvised Music [2.1.1] Craig Taborn (b. 1970) is a pianist, composer, and improviser who has performed on more than one hundred albums. Like many artists considered “jazz” musicians by audiences and media, Taborn finds the genre label limiting: he prefers the term “Black improvisational tradition” ( Shatz 2017 , [6]). Avenging Angel, Taborn’s only solo album, is expansive in range; the excerpts I discuss below represent only a small subset of its stylistic references, techniques, and moods. The album, which was recorded in a single session in 2010 and released in 2011, consists of thirteen improvised tracks. Unlike many improvisations based on an underlying composition, these do not exist in any other studio versions, nor have I found any live recordings that seem to share significant source material with any of the three pieces I discuss in this essay. (1) For this reason, I treat the album’s recorded tracks as autonomous objects of analysis. [2.1.2] The act of analyzing musical improvisations—and particularly the decision to treat an improvised jazz performance as a musical “work”—has been criticized ( Brownell 1994 ; Monson [1996] 2009 ). Detractors often cite the distinction between product , the traditional object of musical analysis, and process , the creative and social act by which that product comes to be, and which is foregrounded in improvisational arts. (2) In extreme cases, such perspectives may deny the relevance of structure and organization (properties of musical works that are the traditional concern of analysis) to the aesthetic value of improvised music, despite significant evidence that musicians themselves see these domains as one side of a productive dialectic between constraint and freedom. (3) For instance, in a revealing conversation with collaborator Camille Norment ( 2020 , ¶ 23), Taborn states, “as much as there is this will toward controlling and structuring things in the music-making improvisational act, I try to allow certain elements their own sort of informational life.” Elsewhere, describing a revelation he had upon listening to a recording of a freely improvised concert, Taborn says, “the improvised performances sounded as organized as any of my composed pieces, and they had so much more life” ( Shatz 2017 , ¶ 29). Both of these comments reveal Taborn’s desire for a balance between structure/organization and the unexpected or spontaneous elements that can give an improvisation “life.” (4) Frustrations with reductive views of improvisation may be behind some artists’ wish to distance themselves from the term. For instance, Taborn remarks (referencing conversations with Vijay Iyer and alluding to the perspective of Wadada Leo Smith), “there is a certain crew of musicians who are done with the term improvisation . . . . Invoking that term brings with it this weight of associations that distance it from other practices, and I don’t think that really functions today” ( Norment and Taborn 2020 , [28]) [2.1.3] Two substantive concerns with the analysis of music from the Black improvisational tradition should be noted and addressed. First, academic musical analysis has traditionally foregrounded Eurocentric romantic and modernist aesthetic ideals of unity and coherence, and its discourse has often presented analytical readings as authoritative and fixed ( Monson [1996] 2009 , 134–39). Even as North American music theory is moving away from these outdated models, (5) analysts should remain vigilant in trying to avoid such pitfalls. While my analyses do highlight aspects of unity or coherence I hear in the music, they argue more fundamentally that multiplicity—a refusal of fixity—is essential to its character. For this and other reasons to be elaborated on below, I do not claim them to be authoritative. [2.1.4] Second, “work-based” analyses tend to privilege the temporal level of the single piece or performance, which in the case of some African diasporic improvised music may be an artificial construction that is less relevant than shorter or longer time spans. As Vijay Iyer writes: The story that an improvisor tells does not unfold merely in the overall form of a “coherent” solo, nor simply in antiphonal structures, but also in the microscopic musical details, as well as in the inherent structure of the performance itself. The story dwells not just in one solo at a time, but also in a single note, and equally in an entire lifetime of improvisations ( Iyer 2004 , 295). Analysts of groove have developed methods that attend effectively to shorter time spans; some of these are described in the next section. The absence of a larger context, however, can be more problematic. Iyer argues that improvisers are more interested in “making improvisations relate to each other” than creating coherence within a particular improvisation. And as several musicologists have noted, analysts who remain laser focused on an individual performance or musician may fail to recognize elements of a broader musical style, not to mention the construction of social and cultural meaning ( Wilson 1990 ; Walser 1993 ; Floyd 1996 ; Givan 2014 ). Any analysis of individual improvisations such as those I provide below, then, should be considered only one piece of a larger puzzle. Our understanding of Taborn’s music will be enhanced by further analytical encounters with his own music, as well as that of his contemporary jazz peers and collaborators (for instance, pianists such as Vijay Iyer and Kris Davis) and influences (such as Sun Ra or Wadada Leo Smith). [2.1.5] Regardless of their broader context, Taborn’s pieces may be experienced as standalone musical works. One can listen to the album’s tracks individually and return to them again and again for further listening and study; this is indeed how I encountered and grew to know the music addressed in this essay. My analyses are written from the perspective of a devoted record listener, not a performer or live concert attendee, and thus represent only one potential analytical angle. I was, however, able to interview Taborn during the late stages of this project. (6) While our discussion took place too late to shape my analysis, I include some of Taborn’s remarks on his creative process to counterbalance my “outsider” perspective. [2.1.6] One final point bears emphasis: although I use transcriptions to illustrate points throughout this essay, the object of my analysis is the recording , and I do not intend to claim any notation as definitive. All my transcriptions should be read as analytical acts, each of which conveys only one potential hearing of an infinitely richer sounding music ( Stanyek et al. 2014 ; Rusch, Salley, and Stover 2016 ). Theorizing Groove [2.2.1] The term “groove” has long been used by jazz musicians to describe an essential yet elusive aspect of their performances. (7) In her landmark ethnographic study, Ingrid Monson ( Monson [1996] 2009 ) identifies two meanings for it. The first, a noun, denotes the “rhythmic feel” of a performance or “swing”; (8) what Monson’s interviewee Jerome Harris calls a “rhythm matrix” (67). The second meaning is typically constructed as a verb or a gerund (groov ing) and refers to “a rhythmic relation or feeling that exists between two or more parts or individuals”; musicians interviewed by Monson describe it as a “euphoria” (Don Byron) or a “trance” (Michael Carvin). Monson emphasizes that this aspect of groove is “emotional and interpersonal” (68) and is often described with social metaphors (93). Similarly, Paul Berliner defines “striking a groove” as the “negotiation of a shared sense of beat” or as “defining and maintaining a solid rhythmic ground for . . .  musical explorations” ( 1994 , 349, 389). Other definitions of groove, intended to encompass African-American music genres beyond jazz, identify more specific rhythmic features. Iyer ( 2002 , 397) defines groove as “a steady, virtually isochronous pulse that is established collectively by an interlocking composite of rhythmic entities and is either intended for or derived from dance.” (9) [2.2.2] Much of the research on groove in jazz music has been inspired by Charles Keil’s ( [1987] 1994 ) theory of participatory discrepancies (PDs) and has focused on microrhythmic features such as swing ratios and asynchrony between parts or band members ( Rose 1989 ; Ellis 1991 ; Prögler 1995 ; Collier and Collier 2002 ; Benadon 2006 ; Honing and de Haas 2008 ).  Under this approach, researchers typically work with precise timing data captured with the assistance of software. They then often highlight the interactive and collective strategies emphasized by Monson, Iyer, and Berliner (Doffman 2009a ; 2009b ). (10) [2.2.3] Matthew Butterfield notes that “Keil and other PD theorists have tended to discount the effect of syntactical pattern— by which I mean only the specific ostinato pattern that makes up a given rhythmic groove—for the production of engendered feeling in jazz and other groove-based musics” ( 2006 , ¶ 4). (11) Butterfield’s categories of “syntactical” and “sub-syntactical” could also be termed “rhythmic/metric” and “microrhythmic,” invoking Justin London’s proposed threshold of ~100 ms as a rough boundary. For London, this duration is “the shortest interval that we can hear or perform as an element of a rhythmic figure” and thus the lower limit for meter ( 2012 , 27). Butterfield notes that dismissing the relevancy of the syntactical (rhythmic/metric) level for groove counterintuitively implies that the types of rhythmic patterns that distinguish specific genres—which themselves “offer different potentials for expressive movement, and. . .  for participatory discrepancies”—are irrelevant. In a recent literature survey on groove, Schmidt Câmara and Danielsen ( 2018 ) identify five rhythmic features associated with groove, four of which (regular beat, subdivision of the beat, counter-rhythm, and syncopation) are at the rhythmic/metric level. (12) [2.2.4] More consistent attention has been given to the rhythmic/metric level in pop music groove scholarship, in which groove is often linked explicitly with cyclic repetition at that level. In an influential and wide-ranging study on the music of Stevie Wonder, Timothy Hughes ( 2003 ), in addition to providing microrhythmic data, describes features ranging from local syncopations and “autotelic” grooves to cyclic phrase structures. Hughes clarifies that “a figure is not a groove unless it is designed to be repeated ” ( 2003 , 14). For Hughes, such repetitions stimulate an aesthetic experience he terms “flow.” In his book on electronic dance music, Mark Butler offers two definitions of groove that roughly correlate with Hughes’s “groove” and “flow”: “1. a short configuration of bass line and percussion that unfolds in continuously repeating cycles. 2. the way in which the rhythmic essence of a piece of music flows or unfolds” ( 2006 , 326). Butler describes common rhythmic features of repeating loops, such as “diatonic rhythms”—maximally even, nonisochronous patterns—and their role in a metric experience that rewards active listener participation ( 2006 , 98–116). Anne Danielsen ( 2006 ), in analyses of funk grooves by James Brown and Parliament, devotes equal time to microrhythmic and rhythmic/metric features. One example of the latter is a technique she terms “counter-rhythm”: a careful balance between syncopation and full cross-rhythm ( 2006 , 70). Robin Attas ( 2015 ), in a study of groove in buildup introductions, focuses exclusively on the rhythmic/metric level, identifying features such as “metric polyphony” and “anacrustic cueing.” Danielsen and Attas, like Hughes and Butler, identify both material and experiential components of groove. [2.2.5] We might understand the role of music analysis as a mediation between the two sides of the groove coin: an attempt, in other words, to describe how repetitive musical material gives rise to particular rhythmic or affective experiences such as Byron’s “euphoria” or Carvin’s “trance.” Much of the literature on groove seeks to further tease out and name these elusive subjective aspects. Of the many associations discussed, I find two particularly relevant to the music I discuss in this essay: (1) the pleasurable urge to embody musical rhythm and/or move to music, and (2) a present-focused temporal experience grounded in the in-time experience of expert performance. (13) In our conversation, Taborn spoke of associating “groove” with repetition that is “static, but moving.” (14) The foundational importance of motion or dance is common to many definitions of groove (e.g., Iyer 2002 , 397), while Monson’s description of groove-as-verb—an action in progress—locates this embodied meaning in ongoing temporality. Other aspects of groove, such as the interactions among ensemble members emphasized by Monson, Hughes, and Iyer, are less pertinent to my listener-based analysis of Taborn’s solo piano music. (15) Example 1 . The ostinato in “Bodies We Come Out Of” (Craig Taborn, Light Made Lighter), with two possible higher-level grouping interpretations (click to enlarge and listen) [2.2.6] Contemporary jazz often features repetitions at the rhythmic/metric level that resemble the groove materials discussed by pop scholars. For instance, in the track “Bodies We Came Out Of” from Taborn’s 2001 trio album Light Made Lighter (with Gerald Cleaver and Chris Lightcap) , the piano ostinato shown in Example 1 cycles continuously for the entire five-minute track. The groove is fleshed out by the drums, which initially clarify the eighth-note subdivisions and 2+3 grouping before becoming more independent, and the bass, which sometimes accompanies the ostinato. The ostinato’s features are essential to the groove’s rhythmic character: it creates a distinctive lilt, bouncing off each shorter/lower tone to land and suspend momentarily on a higher/longer tone. Meanwhile, its pitch patterns lend themselves to multiple higher-level interpretations, as illustrated in the example. Ascending lines in the lower pitches of each pair create two-measure groups, suggesting a sentence-like 2+2+4 phrase structure. Alternatively, hearing the recurring F2–D3 pair in mm. 1, 4, and 7 as a group onset brings out a 3+3+2 pattern that cuts against the duple interpretation (lower set of brackets). This multiplicity of temporal structures calls to mind the experiential effects described by the pop scholars above. [2.2.7] Inspired by the explicit ostinato-like repetitions in Taborn’s music and their metric effects, my analyses below attend to the rhythmic/metric level, and I understand the grooves to have both material and experiential components. In adopting this outlook, I do not deny the potential relevance of other analytical methods or perspectives on groove. Rather, in that much contemporary jazz features repetitive cycles that resemble pop grooves, I hope that my analysis might help to close the distance between the two fields by bringing analysis of groove across genres into closer dialogue.

                "text": "[2.3] Writers on groove and swing have often linked their rhythmic qualities to a tension between novel events and some kind of reference structure, whether the latter be pulse, meter, a recurring riff or ostinato, or even a musical quotation or topic. Samuel Floyd, evoking Henry Louis Gates’s ( 1988 ) concept of “Signifyin(g),” (16) writes, “When sound-events Signify against the time-line, against the flow of its pulse, making the pulse itself lilt freely—swing has been effected” ( Floyd [1991] 2002 , 57). Central to Floyd’s concept is a kind of give-and-take: rhythmic events do not only push “against” the underlying time-line or pulse, they also fundamentally change it. More recently, Guilherme Schmidt Câmara and Anne Danielsen have written: Rhythm as experienced always represents an interaction between virtual reference structures and actual sounding rhythmic events. This interaction works in two directions: a groove always generates some form of reference structure, and reference structures are always applied to a groove. It evokes the relationship between meter and rhythm as described by London ( 2012 ), who understands meter as all or some aspects of the structure provided by endogenous processes in the perception of rhythm, and rhythm as the exogenous, sounding aspect of this interaction ( Schmidt Câmara and Danielsen 2018 , 273). In other words, the playful dialogue between sound events and the time-line described by Floyd may resemble (if not map precisely onto) the relationship between rhythm and meter, so long as meter is understood to be flexible and generated by musical events, rather than rigid and pre-determined. Many theorists consider metric experience key to the groove aesthetic ( Pressing 2002 ; Butler 2006 ; Butterfield 2006 ; Butterfield 2010 ; Attas 2015 ). In accordance with this, my analyses probe the production and experience of meter, viewing this as a continuous and dynamic process of negotiation. For this purpose, I understand “meter” to be a hierarchy of beat levels to which a listener entrains based on periodic or roughly periodic events, as proposed by theorists such as Maury Yeston ( 1976 ), Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff ( [1983] 1996 ), and Justin London ( 2012 ). (17) More recently, theorists such as Danuta Mirka ( 2009 ), Nancy Murphy ( 2015 ), and Kristina Knowles ( 2016 ) have combined aspects of these models with elements from Christopher Hasty’s ( 1997 ) processive theory of meter in order to highlight the experience of finding and maintaining meter as an essential and rewarding part of a listener’s rhythmic experience. Meter is one (although not the only) potential “reference structure” in Schmidt Câmara and Danielsen’s sense: it is generated by the sounding rhythms, yet also determines how those rhythms are perceived. (18) Flexible Ostinati [2.4.1] The grooves analyzed in the remainder of this essay all feature repetitive materials that I term flexible ostinati . These repetitions are characterized by significant flexibility at the rhythmic/metric level in either or both of the material and experiential domains, or “what is played” (Taborn’s performance) and “what is heard/felt” (a listener’s interpretation). (19) Although a true distinction between these domains is impossible, the loose categories are useful for explanatory purposes. In the material/performance domain, Taborn often varies repetitions significantly and continuously, sometimes to the point where the repetition does not create a distinct unit with clear boundaries. In the experiential/interpretation domain, due to rhythmic complexity or variation, these repetitions often do not articulate a single clear meter. These features distinguish flexible ostinati from basic cyclic repetitions (recall Example 1), in which a “basic groove unit” ( Danielsen 2006 ) with unambiguous meter repeats more-or-less exactly. [2.4.2] Nevertheless, flexible ostinati groove in a way that rewards attention to the rhythmic/metric level and to both meter and cyclic material as potential reference structures.  Three essential features of flexible ostinati establish this groove: They comprise a repetitive, omnipresent stream within the overall texture of a passage or piece. Their durations imply an unambiguous, isochronous, metronomic fastest pulse layer, known as the “density referent.” (20) Features such as repetition and accent act as higher-level grouping mechanisms within the ostinato, suggesting cycle and/or meter, even if varied or irregular. The first feature renders the ostinato foundational to a passage’s overall aesthetic, allowing for Iyer’s “interlocking of rhythmic entities” to arise between the ostinato and the other parts. The second promotes entrainment, essential for an embodied experience of musical rhythm, and creates an unbroken continuity that is key to groove’s temporal presence. (21) The third feature hints at the kind of cyclic groove unit familiar from instances like Example 1, and also suggests possible metric interpretations. In combination, these characteristics invite listeners to search continuously for meter or something resembling a “basic groove unit” as potential reference structures.

Danielsen ( 2018 , 46–47) describes the typical “dramaturgy” of groove-based music, with “consecration” and “winding down” phases surrounding a long exposition of the groove itself. Not all repetition-based forms are predicated on processes of intensity change, however. Recent analyses of variable cycles by John Roeder and Michael Tenzer, in music from wide-ranging cultures, demonstrate an array of formal procedures. For instance, Roeder ( 2019 ) shows how cyclic duet partners vary their respective repetitions in response to one another, creating formal contrast, broad trajectories, and rhythmic processes that point beyond the repeating cycle. Roeder and Tenzer ( 2014 ) analyze how large-scale formal processes emerge in ostinato-based music, including through transformation of the ostinato itself. My analyses demonstrate similar variety in Taborn’s groove-based music, showing how larger forms and processes arise through variation in a flexible ostinato, through the juxtaposition of two contrasting grooves, or through the layering of flexible cycles at different time scales.",

By eschewing preconceived formal designs, he hoped to avoid being “led to the same places all the time.” In this sense, the large-scale processes I describe in my analysis can be viewed as growing organically out of the materials themselves, perhaps in unexpected and spontaneous ways.

Example 2 shows a transcription of the beginning with the ostinato on the upper staff. (The transcription adds rehearsal numbers for reference purposes; other notational decisions will be discussed shortly.) Taborn settles into a consistent texture, in which the onsets of sustained chords align with ostinato pitches, at rehearsal 1. The rhythm of the ostinato in this excerpt is typical of the piece: it freely combines durations of eighth, quarter, and dotted quarter notes, with longer durations sounding only infrequently. Without any regular grouping or repeated pattern, the ostinato’s metric implications are ambiguous: it provides a clear density referent (the eighth), two options for a tactus duration (the quarter or dotted quarter), and no higher-level grouping. The airy ostinato seems to float above the music rather than ground it, a sensation supported by its high register. The repetition lacks the defining feature of a typical ostinato: there is no precisely repeated melodic or rhythmic pattern, no identifiable cycle with a beginning and an end.

The bar lines and implied tactus values of Example 2 convey one kind of hearing: that of a listener open to flexible tactus lengths and inclined to hear the harmonic arrivals that begin at rehearsal 1 as “downbeats,” as indicated by the solid bar lines that precede them. (The dashed bar lines respond loosely to features such as rhythmic parallelisms and durational accents in the ostinato, but are intended primarily to aid readability and convey a general sense of “measuredness,” not to advocate strongly for a particular interpretation.) The transcription notably does not convey the slight, persistent sense of syncopation that results from an attempt to hear a continuous isochronous pulse in either quarter or dotted-quarter values. My own hearing hovers somewhere in between these two temporal listening strategies. The unpredictability of the ostinato’s onsets registers as something like a gentle syncopation, perhaps felt against a simple quarter-note pulse; however, if asked to identify the phase of that pulse—i.e., to decide which notes are onbeats and which offbeats—I would struggle to settle on an interpretation. To demonstrate, Example 3 and Example 4 renotate the music starting just before rehearsal 1 to suggest two possible phases of a continuous quarter-note pulse. In the figures, bar lines have been removed and all syncopations against the quarter-note pulse are indicated with tied eighth notes. While my hearing aligns more closely with Example 3, in which most of the chordal onsets are interpreted as occurring on beats, I can also entertain the more syncopated orientation of Example 4, in which the ostinato consists primarily of gentle, stylistic offbeats. (23) Although the majority of my transcriptions maintain the notational style of Example 2, which is somewhat easier to read, they should be taken to represent only one aspect of the music’s multifaceted metric implications.",

Nearly all of the track’s melodic and harmonic content derives from the simultaneous presentation of two interval cycles, which produces a sequence of dyads (see, e.g., Perle 1977 ).  Two separate interval cycle pairings result in what I refer to as “primary” and “secondary” dyad series.

This sensation, however, is disrupted near the end of the third presentation (twelfth measure of Example 10), when the ostinato resumes its earlier, irregular rhythmic style. Here the regular offbeats are replaced by a free mix of durations, illustrated in simplified form above the staff. Although the fourth presentation of the dyads states a varied repetition of the earlier four-bar rhythm, the missing downbeat now obscures the hypermetric relationship. Without the consistent ostinato offbeats, I find it difficult to maintain feeling 4 4 even at the lower levels. The ostinato has regained its flexibility—the music will never again settle into a predictable grid.

If the notes of the ostinato were earlier heard as tactus-level “beats” in an unpredictable but meter-like flow, the high Es now add another hierarchical level to this flexible temporal structure. Meanwhile, the primary dyad series returns, gaining intensity through six successive presentations. (Only the first three are shown in Example 12).

Like many minimalist works, much of the joy of “The Broad Day King” resides in its dynamic metric sensations, which allow constant reinterpretation of its recurring pitch materials. Critically, Taborn avoids strict repetition and predictable process, treating the ostinato and the two series of dyads flexibly. While Taborn’s “kernel” materials (see pargraph 2.6 above) themselves intimate cyclic reference structures, his performance avoids the clear beginnings, endings, and periodicities that would articulate those structures definitively. Only in the final section does the primary dyad series emerge as continuous and regular, exposing the cyclic nature of this improvisational seed while creating a final escalation of energy. The ostinato, on the other hand, never succumbs to straightforward cyclicity. With its shifting rhythms, deceptive simplicity, and delicate articulation, it floats freely above the texture, compelling entrainment to possible pulse streams while refusing to be pinned down by a single metric interpretation. “Avenging Angel”",

                "text": "[4.0] While “The Broad Day King” embeds its repeating cycles within a relatively conventional ABA' form, flexible ostinati in “Avenging Angel” play a more dynamic role in its formal process. The track is structured around two contrasting ostinati that compete for dominance. I begin my discussion with an account of their individual qualities and the reference structures each suggests, giving special attention to potential metric interpretations of the second ostinato. I then proceed with an overview of the entire track, showing how the two ostinati unfold and interact over the course of Taborn’s performance. Two Contrasting Ostinati Example 13 . Ostinato 1 as presented at the opening (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.1] The piece opens with ominous, low-register material that I call “Ostinato 1.” Ostinato 1 strongly projects a simple quadruple meter ( Example 13 ). Its relatively conventional syncopated rhythm is directed toward downbeat events that function simultaneously as beginning and ending, a feature of many grooves that Timothy Hughes ( 2003 , 15) calls “autotelicism.” This one-bar rhythm is initially repeated at two pitch levels, suggesting an oscillation between tonic and dominant that also generates autotelicism at the two-bar level. Once established, Ostinato 1 begins to slowly transform, suggesting that the piece will have a linear form driven by continuous development rather than a strict cycle. The ostinato is materially flexible (its repetitions vary), but relatively fixed in its metric interpretation. As examples in the next section will demonstrate, the variations on Ostinato 1 that dominate the first few minutes of the piece suggest new harmonies, linear progressions, and formal articulations even as its characteristic rhythmic and textural features are retained. [4.1.2] The second ostinato contrasts with the first in almost every way. Rather than the rumbling chordal repetition of Ostinato 1, Ostinato 2 takes the form of a complex, freewheeling bass line. Its prominent dyadic thirds, fifths, and sixths suggest tertian chords that interlock in a flexible manner—a loose cycle of overlapping harmonies. (26) Once presented in full for the first time, the cycle is almost never varied. While its material identity is fixed, its ambiguous beginning, slippery tonality, and complex metric structure render it highly flexible in interpretation. In the passage that ends the track (4:05–6:49), Ostinato 2 cycles continuously, providing ample opportunities to embody its rhythms and repetitions. This affords contemplation of the ostinato as an external reference structure—one that exists in the mind of the listener, apart from any specific instance, but that is also under constant negotiation due to its flexibility. For a listener, constructing this abstraction and experiencing its multiple metric potentialities is a highly engaging aspect of the passage’s groove. Further, the familiarity gained from repeat listenings to “Avenging Angel” allows one to detect subtle allusions to Ostinato 2 that precede its complete unveiling in the track’s denouement. In the remainder of this section, I discuss interpretation of the ostinato as an abstract entity, returning to analysis of its in-time presentations in the following section. Audio Example 1 . “Avenging Angel,” 5:17–5:40 Example 14 . “Avenging Angel,” Ostinato 2 (two alternate orientations) (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.3] Because any single transcription will conceal elements of Ostinato 2’s interpretive malleability, I recommend listening to it before looking at the notated examples. The excerpt in Audio Example 1, drawn from the ending passage mentioned above, fades in mid-cycle and fades out again after approximately three cycles. (27) In moving to assemble a visual representation, one must remain cognizant of notational biases: these include the choice of a starting place (which may not be perceived as such while the ostinato is cycling), enharmonic pitch spellings (which can convey specific harmonic and grouping interpretations), and rhythms (which can imply a particular metric interpretation). Example 14 provides two transcriptions that differ only in their starting place. (28) (Support for hearing each orientation will be discussed below.) Given the ostinato’s range of harmonic potentialities, I have opted for pitch spellings that preserve as many stacked tertian intervals as possible; any grouping or larger tonal implications of these spellings is unintended. Regarding rhythms, Ostinato 2’s two unequal durations are in a two-to-three ratio that is confirmed by the faster notes of Taborn’s melodic lines. In my transcriptions, these isochronous subdivisions are understood to be sixteenth-note pulses, such that the pitches of Ostinato 2 are notated as a string of eighth and dotted eighth notes (for now, without beaming). The gray time signatures provided in this and future examples serve primarily to indicate total duration and should not be taken to carry all the metric connotations that typically accompany time signatures. Example 15 . Repetition splits Ostinato 2 (shown in Orientation 1) into two halves related by transposition (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.4] As was the case for Ostinato 1, repetition splits Ostinato 2 into two parts; see top and bottom portions of Example 15 . In contrast to the tonal relationship between Ostinato 1’s halves, these two are related by semitone transposition. The dashed boxes in the figure highlight two exceptions to the strict transposition and the arrow points to the sole note transposed by 11 semitones rather than 1. This single octave displacement keeps the ostinato’s ambitus within a single octave (C2 to B2) in which all twelve pitch classes are sounded. The rhythms are partially altered across the ostinato’s two halves, although each features a middle zone in which the rhythm and contour are identical (see boxed area in the example.) Despite this significant overlap, the repetition can be difficult to perceive. Slight alterations—the changed durations, the missing/extra note, the octave displacement—significantly mask the melody’s transposed recurrence. This is due not only to the collective impact of all the minor alterations of pitch-class and rhythm, but also to the fact that they occur mostly at the starting and ending edges of each line. (29) As I will argue below, the concealed nature of the repetition allows potential lower-level metric structures to arise which conflict with this apparent upper-level organization. [4.1.5] Although most conceptions of Ostinato 2 as a fixed abstraction would require it to have a definitive beginning and ending, “Avenging Angel” affords hearing the two halves shown in Example 15 in either order. “Orientation 1” begins with the upper staff material (the “G transposition”), while “Orientation 2” begins with the lower staff material (the “ G ♭ transposition”). Prominent formal divisions near the end of the track support hearing Orientation 1: Taborn starts the final section with the G transposition, and employs textural changes in his soloing to align with the boundaries of Orientation 1 (e.g., see Example 23). However, there are also good reasons to hear Orientation 2. The G ♭ on which it starts sounds accented for several reasons: it is preceded by a double neighbor figure that suggests it begins a new harmony, it is of contextually long duration, and it initiates a contour change. (30) The G that starts Orientation 1 has none of these accentuating features. Additionally, the earliest partial statements of the ostinato—discussed further in the next section—usually include the beginning of the G ♭ transposition, but not the beginning of the G transposition. As I discuss below, the question of Ostinato 2’s orientation not only impacts its identity as a reference structure, but becomes entwined with metric interpretation of the ostinato and its groove. Example 16 . Two interpretations of tactus-level beat groups, shown by beams, within Ostinato 2 (Orientation 2) (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.6] Metric perception generally begins with the search for a tactus, a primary beat level occurring at a moderate tempo that encourages entrainment. (31) In passages dominated by Ostinato 2, the tactus is not obvious. The ostinato’s eighth and dotted-eighth durations present one option, albeit a relatively fast one. The two durations in a 2:3 proportion resemble those of the asymmetric-yet-maximally-even rhythmic cycles often found in repeating grooves, such as the loops of electronic dance music ( Butler 2006 , 82–85), but the four dotted eighths are unevenly distributed within the fifty-sixteenth cycle. Because of the tempo and length of the cycle, I find myself grouping the eighth and dotted-eighth notes into slower beats as I listen. I gravitate toward the grouping shown by beams in Example 16 , interpretation (a), which points toward Orientation 2. Although I arrived at this hearing intuitively, it follows several logical “preference rules.” All of the dotted-quarter onsets (contextually long durations) and local pitch nadirs initiate beats, the contour never changes within a beat, passing tones do not initiate beats (i.e., are in a metrically weak position), and all ascending perfect fifths—which strongly imply harmonic continuation—occur within the same beat. The last two “rules” reflect an assumption that the ostinato implies tertian harmonies. In addition, the grouping responds to two prominent parallelisms of rhythm and contour at the beginning, shown with green and blue brackets. (32) [4.1.7] The “preference rules” that guide my interpretation (a) necessarily leave others unfulfilled. Significantly, the beat-groups of interpretation (a) range from four to seven sixteenths in duration, thus violating conventional metric expectations for strict periodicity ( Lerdahl and Jackendoff [1983] 1996 , 69) or maximal evenness within a non-isochronous beat cycle ( London 2012 , 128–29). (33) (In practice, the principle of maximal evenness limits the number of distinct beat types to two, “short” and “long.”) Indeed, tapping along to interpretation (a), some of the continuity of pulse I normally experience when I entrain to a tactus becomes attenuated towards the end. This suggests to me an alternate interpretation, shown in part (b) of Example 16. This version makes a slight adjustment to the second half, such that the ostinato is partitioned into a series of beat-groups with only two durations: five sixteenths and six sixteenths. Interpretation (b) preserves the parallelism and other features of (a) in the first half of the ostinato, while violating grouping conventions in the second half (34) in order to prioritize similarity of duration. (35) I find interpretation (b) quite easy to feel, and even a bit more engaging than (a). When I attend primarily to the ostinato itself rather than Taborn’s soloing, I can experience the beat durations as nominally isochronous at a moderate tempo in the range of 68–82 bpm. With more focus, I can hear the two durations as “short” and “long” beats within a non-isochronous cycle, although not one that is maximally even. (36) When I attune to interpretation (b), the accented passing tone, offbeat long note, and lack of parallelism give the second half a pleasantly off-kilter, “syncopated” feel that enhances the sense of arrival on the G ♭ , where the tension between equality of duration and other grouping preference rules is resolved. This oscillation between stability and instability resembles more conventional autotelic grooves, such as that in Ostinato 1 (Example 13). Example 17 . An interpretation of tactus-level beat-groups, shown by beams, within Ostinato 2 (Orientation 1) (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.8] While interpretations (a) and (b) each provide a compelling entrainable tactus, both are incompatible with the higher-level grouping suggested by the transposed repetition. The arrows in Example 16 show where that repetition begins: in the middle of a tactus beat-group. Thus, a listener committed to (a) or (b) cannot simultaneously experience the two-part division, which requires hearing a strong beginning on this G. Moreover, both (a) and (b) are incompatible with Orientation 1. A commitment to Orientation 1 requires a complete reworking of these mid-level beat-groups, and it is no longer possible to prioritize all of the grouping preference rules previously noted. Interpretation (c) in Example 17 shows what is, to my ears, the best solution, only sacrificing the preference rule for pitch nadirs at the very end. This grouping lacks the low-level rhythmic parallelisms of (a) and (b) highlighted in Example 16 and employs a wider range of beat durations throughout. Indeed, it is impossible to group the events of the ostinato under Orientation 1 such that consecutive groups differ by only a sixteenth, as in interpretation (b). For these reasons, I find interpretation (c) significantly less “catchy” than either (a) or (b). When I listen for the high-level repetition or orient myself to the G beginning, I become considerably more ambivalent about lower-level grouping. Example 18 . Ostinato 2, interpretation (d) (click to enlarge and listen) [4.1.9] At least one alternative tactus option remains: a steady quarter-note pulse of around 102 bpm, against which many of the ostinato’s events are syncopated, with a single interpolated dotted-quarter beat. Interpretation (d), shown in both orientations in Example 18 , follows a different set of preference rules than (a) through (c). Isochrony is now prioritized, while alignment of beats with event onsets is only a second-level concern. Interpretation (d) has a solid grounding in the style of groove-based music, in which bass line ostinati are often syncopated against a steady pulse. At the same time, other features of most such music that aid a listener’s metric interpretation—including conventional genre signifiers pointing to a specific metric type, regularity in another part, clear harmonic rhythm, or prominent mid-level rhythmic repetitions—are absent here. (37) Perceiving interpretation (d) thus requires some work on the listener’s part, but it offers rewards at higher levels. The interpretation highlights the two-part structure created by the transposed repetition, with each half of the ostinato following a path from stability to instability and back. The single elongated beat at the end of the G transposition creates a slight disruption which, in combination with the rising steady eighth notes, heightens the sense of arrival and resolution of tension at the start of the G ♭ transposition. Interpretation (d) allows for either orientation, although the lengthened anacrusis leading into the G ♭ transposition tilts my hearing toward Orientation 2. Example 19 . Mid- and upper-level metric possibilities for tactus interpretations (a) and (d), both shown in Orientation 2 (click to enlarge) [4.1.10] The flexibility in tactus choice extends to the next highest metric level—that is, to a metric layer that might be notated as the measure or half-measure, and which is often phenomenally prominent in groove-based music. (For instance, consider the measure-length rhythmic repetition present in Ostinato 1 or in the “Bodies We Come Out Of” ostinato shown in Example 1.) For Ostinato 2, I can entertain any of the options shown in Example 19 , which depicts two of my possible tactus interpretations, (b) and (d), under Orientation 2 for easy comparison. Interpretation (b), in my hearing, leads to relatively unambiguous higher levels: an essentially duple framework punctuated by the rhythmic surprise of a single beat extension. Naturally, it continues to conflict with the two-part division suggested by the transposed repetition at these higher levels. By contrast, the two halves of interpretation (d), each of which contain six tactus beats, can just as easily be grouped into twos (supported by the strong on-beat arrival on the third of these groups) or threes (supported by the overall contour of the two halves). [4.1.11] The point of this discussion is not to argue that any of the above metric interpretations is the “correct” one. Rather, it is to demonstrate that Ostinato 2 not only allows a variety of interpretations, but practically demands that a listener experiment with them. Various features of the ostinato compel one to listen metrically. Its strict cyclic repetition encourages an embodied response to its recurring rhythms, the density referent provides a metronomic and omnipresent pulse, and its two durations resemble those of familiar non-isochronous rhythmic and metric cycles. Parallelisms, harmonic implications, and contour all suggest higher-level beat-groups which might serve as a comfortable tactus. At the same time, Ostinato 2 offers no simple solution to the “problem” of finding an entrainable tactus or a hierarchy of beat levels, because any metric interpretation challenges listeners to ignore a contradictory hearing that illuminates some other compelling aspect of the music. Some of these tensions might be understood as a conflict between bottom-up and top-down decision-making. Interpretation (b), for instance, begins with an accessible tactus and builds upon it a multi-tiered metric hierarchy, yet it conceals a fundamental aspect of the ostinato’s pitch organization (the transposed repetition). Interpretation (d), by contrast, prioritizes upper-level structures and sweeping isochrony at the expense of a clearly articulated tactus and unambiguous mid-level groupings. [4.1.12] Taborn’s own comments about meter suggest that he often thinks in an additive and polyrhythmic way which might resemble some combination of the above interpretations or something entirely different still. In one interview given a few years after Avenging Angel was released, he says, “I deal a lot with multiples; multiple meters that make up even larger groupings. It’s more about doing things modularly. . . . A patterned, grid-like way of playing complicated stuff is too diagrammatic for me” ( Whitehead 2013 , in response to the prompt “You do like higher metrical games. . . ”) When I asked Taborn how he generally thinks about or feels meter while improvising, his answer was complex. “I tend to organize things in my thinking around larger chunks of rhythm,” he explained, describing midlevel polyrhythmic structures divided into “a big two” (or three) as a kind of “tentpole.” “I’ve internalized pulse rate and rhythmic groove information inside, and then I play with. . .  whatever is going on in that piece. Even if it’s something like an eleven-beat thing, I’ll switch the six and five back and forth. . . . It gets very nested and tuplet-y, but it’s really based on the stronger sense of the larger chunks underneath.” When working with polyrhythms, he likes to avoid the kind of rhythmic “problem-solving” in which “the meaning, the multiplicity of the groove, that kind of African feel gets lost and everything gets flattened out—I like to keep the identity of the different layers.” These comments suggest to me that Taborn himself values the kind of temporal multiplicity modeled by my approach, although he may feel it quite differently than I do. [4.1.13] The particular metric tensions that underlie Ostinato 2 are brought out by the formal and energetic trajectory of the track as a whole. Fragments of the ostinato that appear early in the piece obscure its larger design and promote hearing beat-groups such as those in (a) or (b), which privilege Orientation 2. But in the last section, when the ostinato is finally heard in full, contextual cues and the now-complete transposed repetition support Orientation 1, which conflicts with those earlier interpretations. The incompatibility of these levels rewards a listening strategy that refuses to choose, and instead toggles continuously between interpretations, remaining open to the divergent ways that they color the groove’s events and thus finding novelty and difference in its repetitions. (38) [4.1.14] The dynamic tension between different grouping criteria and between incompatible lower- and higher-level interpretations resembles the characteristic play between sounding rhythm and external reference structures described by Floyd ( [1991] 2002 ) and Schmidt Câmara and Danielsen ( 2018 ). While listening to Ostinato 2, the listener is invited to experiment with different hearings and participate actively and continuously in the creation of meter. Mark Butler describes a similar aesthetic in his work on electronic dance music grooves, writing that metric ambiguity encourages one to “ construe the meter actively rather than absorb metric information passively” ( 2006 , 137, emphasis original). Strict repetition, he notes, offers plenty of time for listeners to experiment with different interpretations (127). In the following section, I describe how “Avenging Angel” builds to a conclusion that features extended strict repetition of Ostinato 2, thus culminating in a celebration of its cyclicity and interpretive flexibility. Formal Process [4.2.1] Taborn’s six-minute performance of “Avenging Angel” is structured around the steady emergence of and ultimate takeover by Ostinato 2. This dynamic process can be roughly divided into three phases. The first, spanning 0:00–1:30, is based entirely on Ostinato 1. In the second phase, 1:30–4:05, increasingly prominent fragments of Ostinato 2 begin to intrude, blending with and destabilizing Ostinato 1’s groove. In the final phase, 4:05–6:49, Ostinato 2 emerges as dominant, cycling continuously without variation. Example 20 . “Avenging Angel,” first phase (0:00–1:30), based solely in Ostinato 1 (click to enlarge, see the rest, and listen) [4.2.2] The first phase ( Example 20 ) introduces and expands on the ideas of Ostinato 1. After an eight-bar exposition in which the ostinato’s repeating chords are heard alone, the ostinato begins (at rehearsal A in the transcription) to support simple melodic content and to slowly transform. Initially, only slight rhythmic variations occur. Soon, though, melodic chromaticism destabilizes the opening C ♯ -minor tonality and the pitches of the ostinato itself begin to change, now favoring low-register cluster chords moving in slow chromatic lines (e.g., the inner voices at the transcription’s rehearsal B). [4.2.3] Near rehearsal B, Ostinato 1 abandons the pitch/harmonic repetition that distinguished its first and second measures and is thus transformed into a one-bar structure defined only by rhythm, texture, and the flat contour of its repeated chords. Nevertheless, throughout this opening phase, Ostinato 1’s metric regularity extends to the level of four- and eight-bar phrases. The only notable exceptions to this pure-duple hierarchy are a six-beat transitional phrase extension (going into rehearsal B) and a single six-bar phrase (at B). Example 21 . “Avenging Angel,” start of second phase (1:30–2:15) (click to enlarge, see the rest, and listen) [4.2.4] Soon, this regularity is challenged. During the piece’s middle phase, elements of Ostinato 2 begin to intrude, disrupting and distorting Ostinato 1’s groove without ever gaining the upper hand. Example 21 shows an annotated transcription of the passage that begins this phase. A detailed discussion of this representative excerpt will show how the two grooves compete for dominance during this middle phase. Four melodic entrances are numbered ① through ④ above the staff, and prominent occurrences of Ostinato 1’s characteristic rhythm and texture are marked “O1.1”, “O1.2”, etc., for reference. For clarity and simplicity, Example 21 only shows rhythmic notation for most of the left-hand part and for the Ostinato 1 interruptions. [4.2.5] Following two bars of the default Ostinato 1 rhythm (O1.1), the melodic entrance at ① triggers the first subtle hints of Ostinato 2. First, the accompaniment part begins to play groups of five (2+3) sixteenths. This rhythm anticipates the bass line durations of Ostinato 2—as well as a cycle near the end of phase 3 in which Taborn’s soloing features the same 2+3 pattern—and obscures the 4 4 meter. The regular 2+3 grouping soon dissolves into an unpredictable mixture of eighth and dotted-eighth durations in the accompaniment, as the melody intimates a short-lived dotted-eighth cross-pulse. Melody and accompaniment briefly seem to lose their metric grounding, but a sudden emphatic return of Ostinato 1’s original rhythm (O1.2) wrenches us back to a strict 4 4 . [4.2.6] Over the rest of the passage, allusions to Ostinato 2 become increasingly more overt. The next two melodic entrances at ② and ③ outline a series of Ostinato 2’s pitches, as shown above the staff in the Example. (39) The final melodic entrance at ④ culminates in an exact fragment of Ostinato 2, doubled at the octave for a powerful and memorable impact. Each of these melodic segments, however, is interrupted by a return of Ostinato 1’s original rhythm and texture (O1.3–5) that reorients us to its basic groove. These entrances seem to come in the nick of time, each one pulling us back from a precipitous cliff edge. Finally, after the most prominent intrusion of Ostinato 2 in the final segment, O1.5 introduces a more extended return to Ostinato 1, in a ruminative passage that resembles the longer transition at the end of Example 20. [4.2.7] Two larger points about the music shown in Example 21 are worth noting. First, its rhythms can always be understood to continue Ostinato 1’s basic quarter-note pulse, even when perception of that pulse is momentarily challenged, and nearly the entire excerpt can be understood in 4 4 . The passage even features a quasi-duple phrase structure (four subphrases, each roughly 3–4 bars), which resembles the sectional architecture of the opening more than the continuous cyclicity of Ostinato 2 in the piece’s final phase. These global rhythmic features contribute to the continued dominance of Ostinato 1’s groove even as it faces a wide variety of intrusions. Second, both the allusion to Ostinato 2 spread across the second and third melodic segments and the explicit reference in the fourth segment emphasize an arrival on the G ♭ that initiates Orientation 2—the first by placing it on a downbeat and the second through sudden octave doubling. This is characteristic of the Ostinato 2 fragments that occur throughout the middle phase, priming a listener to hear the G ♭ as a beginning before Ostinato 2 ever sounds in full. [4.2.8] Over the next few minutes, uprisings of melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic content reminiscent of Ostinato 2 are continually quashed by returns of Ostinato 1’s basic rhythm and its variations. The conflict plays out in a stunning variety of manners at the local level; here I will only give a sense of the broad sweep. The passage from approximately 2:20 to 2:50 traces a trajectory of intensification resembling that of Example 21 but with increasingly irregular phrase structure. The material that follows (beginning around 2:50) features less blending and more of an alternation between the two grooves, giving Ostinato 2 more autonomy without allowing it to fully blossom. Across all of these passages, tension ratchets up as increasingly longer and more prominent fragments of Ostinato 2 intrude. The middle phase culminates in a kind of sequencing of Ostinato-2-like materials (3:40 to 4:05), ending in a final statement of Ostinato 1 and a brief pause that clears sonic space for the start of the final phase of the piece. Example 22 . “Avenging Angel,” beginning of final phase, first two cycles of Ostinato 2 (click to enlarge and listen) [4.2.9] Ostinato 2 begins the final phase at 4:05 on the initial G of Orientation 1. Example 22 shows the first two cycles of Taborn’s solo. For listeners conditioned by the ostinato’s structure and by its partial earlier entrances to hear Orientation 2, this new phase seems to start in medias res , almost as if the ostinato had been cycling all along and we have only just tuned in. This impression is reinforced by its soft entrance, which emerges out of the resonance of a crashing chord. [4.2.10] Ostinato 2 loops continuously without variation for nearly three minutes as Taborn solos over it. (40) Its unchanging repetitions give listeners plenty of time to explore various metric interpretations and experience its differences from Ostinato 1. Ostinato 1 was flexible in its material identity, developing and changing throughout the first and middle phases. Those changes facilitated the creation of larger formal trajectories and phrase structures with clear beginnings and endings. Ostinato 2, in contrast, is entirely fixed in its material identity, creating no hierarchical phrase structures and at times obscuring the sense that it has a beginning at all. Yet it is almost infinitely flexible in its interpretation, rewarding a listener’s continued attention to the sounding music’s interaction with a kaleidoscopic array of potential reference structures. Example 23 . Final phase, last four cycles (6:16–end). The ostinato is shown beamed here according to interpretation (c). (click to enlarge and listen) [4.2.11] Although Ostinato 2 itself is unchanging, Taborn’s soloing builds in intensity over it. Factors that contribute to the build include a gradual increase in loudness and rhythmic density, registral expansion and ascent, and eventually, the introduction of chords and rhythmic features such as cross-pulse. While most of the final phase features fluid melodies like those in Example 22, Taborn uses the last few cycles to focus exclusively on the groove’s rhythmic possibilities through repeated articulations ( Example 23 ). In the nineteenth and twentieth cycles, Taborn combines the ostinato with a repeated-note pattern. Although this five-sixteenth recurring rhythm could have fit evenly into the full fifty-sixteenth cycle, Taborn instead introduces a hiccup so that the rhythm aligns differently with the two consecutive cycles. In the twenty-first (penultimate) cycle, the ostinato is paired with chords that alternate inter-onset intervals of five and six sixteenths, finally providing the maximally even division of fifty pulses into nine beats that the ostinato itself declined to offer. The repeated chords in the right hand, which escalate in intensity in the final cycle, recall the earlier repetitions of Ostinato 1. The performance thus ends with a final allusion to the dialectic that has structured its unfolding. “Neverland”",

In this case, the three phases are distinguished by markedly different textures, and each of the latter two involve their own flexible ostinati. The track opens with a bouncy contrapuntal texture in which two voices pass off short motifs. (41) This gives way at about 1:10 to a dreamy passage initially underpinned by a simple triple-time ostinato. This ostinato quickly begins to vary, losing its metric stability and clear basic unit before its recurring fragments fade away entirely. (42) This middle phase is characterized by the slow traversal of a registral arch, a relatively high tessitura, and a texture that primarily combines right-hand melodic material with gentle left-hand accompanimental figurations. Toward the end of the middle phase’s descent, starting around 2:30, Taborn’s left hand begins to pluck out detached low-register pitches that slowly coalesce into a more continuous bass line. As the right hand transitions to playing sustained chords for the first time in the piece (around 2:54), marking the start of the third phase, this new bass line gains energy and begins to convey a more continuous and entrainable pulse.

The quarter pulse presents itself as a likely tactus, but its two possible phases are each plausible at different moments. Neither results in a parallel interpretation of events across iterations. Taborn avoids repetition of patterns that might suggest a familiar metric type such as 4 4 . The sustained chords throughout this section are also irregular in duration ( Example 25 ). Their onsets typically occur on an eighth-note beat during which the bass line rests, creating a syncopation-like effect—although whether it is the chord or the bass line that is syncopated remains open to interpretation.",

For instance, the A2–D2 descending fifth that concludes Iterations 1, 3, and 5 also occurs, in approximately the same position, transposed down one and two semitones in Iterations 4 and 6. There is another descending fifth earlier in the paradigmatic pitch series, and other transpositions occur that are less clearly tethered to the series. The five-note ending gesture (red box) from Iterations 1 and 3 occurs up a fourth in Iteration 5, where it does not function as an ending, and a fragment of this version repeats in Iteration 6. Finally, the mid-cycle sequence of pitches D3–G2–G3 that occurs in Iterations 7 and 9 as a variant of the paradigmatic D3–G2–A3 is an exact transposition of an earlier gesture (in Iteration 4) not drawn from the series; ascending octave leaps on their own are also common throughout the ostinato. (43) These details suggest that the series and its iterations as portrayed in the diagram do not tell the entire “varied repetition” story: some of the pitch content and ordering is fuzzy, and smaller gestures (defined by rhythm, contour, and intervallic pattern as well as pitch) also play a role in our perception of repetition and continuity.",

Thus, while the quantitative data in Examples 27–29 is useful for demonstrating variation and overall trends, the tables’ specificity is misleading in that they presume the existence of nine precisely defined iterations. The problem goes beyond the fact that exact cyclic boundaries are difficult to locate, and even that the tables imply segmented-ness rather than flow. More profoundly, the numbers reflect only one interpretation at the expense of others. They show the flexibility in the ostinato’s material form, but not in our experience of it.",
