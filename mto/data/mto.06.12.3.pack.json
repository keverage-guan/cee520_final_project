    "abstract": "The third volume ofSyntagma musicumby Michael Praetorius is one of the most important treatises on musical forms, terminology, and performance practices of the early seventeenth century; it is also one of the earliest sources to discuss thoroughbass theory. Due to the complexity of its prose, which incorporates German, Latin, and Greek, more than three centuries passed before the first English translation was completed. Jeffery Kite-Powell successfully confronts Praetorius’s highly technical and intricate language and in so doing makesSyntagma musicumIIItangible to a wider audience of performers, students, and educators.",

                "text": "[1] The third volume of Michael Praetorius’s Syntagma musicum (1619) provides a wealth of information on musical forms, notation, terminology, and practices of the early seventeenth century and contains one of the earliest discussions of thoroughbass theory. The first twelve chapters of the treatise focus on sacred and secular vocal music and cover a wide range of genres, including motets, madrigals, arias, and quodlibets. Praetorius also describes several instrumental genres, such as fantasias, fugues, sonatas, toccatas, and various dance forms, including the galliard, courante, and allemande.\nIn the second part of Syntagma musicum III, Praetorius defines and explains principles of notation, such as ligatures, coloration, and proportions in duple and triple meters. His guidelines for recognizing the mode of a composition are influenced by Glarean and Calvisius; he gives the range of all twelve modes and reorders them to begin with C-Ionian. In the last chapter of part two, which concerns the use of unisons and octaves, Praetorius stipulates that the bass is “the foundation of all parts,” and he says that it\n  “must be more clearly and convincingly heard than the other parts.” (1)",

Relying on compositions and remarks of Ludovico Viadana and Agostino Agazzari, Praetorius states that thoroughbass is the principal part, because it contains within itself the entire composition. (2) Unlike some later discussions on thoroughbass, Praetorius’s discussion includes instructions for both keyboardists and musicians who play plucked instruments; he says that the rules are the same for both groups of musicians, except that plucked instruments should not play thoroughbass when used for melody. Another topic preoccupying later thoroughbass theorists is unfigured bass lines; evidently, this was a problem even in the early seventeenth century, because Praetorius specifies that\n“it is absolutely essential that signs be notated above the notes.” (3) He adds that this rule applies to untrained and experienced musicians alike.",

(7) Although he has edited the original text by correcting errors and simplifying complex sentences and terms, Kite-Powell explains that his most challenging objective was to make SMIII a useful, accessible source in our time while preserving the meaning behind Praetorius’s discourse. By focusing on the original text rather than digressing into discussions of instruments and performance practice, analyses of pieces mentioned in the treatise, and lists of authors and composers cited by Praetorius, Kite-Powell avoids\n“cluttering the text” with material that is widely available in reference sources. He refers his readers to nine sources that provide information on performance practice and five other sources that give information on the life and music of Praetorius. Although footnotes elaborating on definitions and names mentioned in the treatise are not included, the edition does contain an index of authors along with their dates.",

Streamlining Praetorius’s use of Greek, Latin, and German has been one of the most daunting tasks and most likely explains why only one English translation had been attempted prior to Kite-Powell’s edition. In order to let his readers know which language Praetorius uses throughout the treatise, Kite-Powell uses italics to indicate Latin phrases and words originally written in a plain roman font. Greek words in chapter headings are retained, transliterated, and translated, whereas Greek terms in the body of the treatise are translated and written in italics. (8) German words originally written in Fraktur are rendered in plain roman font. In addition, the editor briefly explains Praetorius’s reasons for using multiple languages. Passages covering complex issues targeted for scholars are in Latin and Greek; those intended for wider audiences are in German.",

Including the original text would have made the edition much longer and more expensive and thus possibly less accessible.

Examples are transcribed into modern notation, but the figures are not. Again, showing the original text with examples and figures alongside of the translation with transcribed examples and figures would have been more helpful to readers. Also, rendering the original C-clefs as F- and G-clefs would allow readers to interpret the examples more efficiently. In chapter 6, figures 2.1 through 2.5 would be clearer if transcribed into modern notation with a footnote clarifying Praetorius’s distinction between common and new Italian views of the modes.

Moreover, Praetorius’s discussion of the Italian approach to proportions in chapter seven would have been clearer had his table been preserved instead of having its contents incorporated into the paragraph.

Using\n“Γ” instead of a customized graphic would make these clefs much easier to interpret. Moreover, some of the gamma clefs are placed on the wrong line; in Example 3.20, the gamma clef should be on line two instead of line three. (16) Example 3.18 has a CC-clef, which should be positioned on the first line, not on the ledger line below the staff.
