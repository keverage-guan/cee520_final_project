An articulate conservative political philosopher\nclosely associated with Margaret Thatcher, Scruton is also an amateur composer, who\nobviously cares deeply about music and is much concerned with diagnosing the reasons for\nthe decline of musical culture in recent years. Scruton’s aesthetics draws heavily\non German idealism, which he couples with a thorough knowledge of analytic philosophy and\na surprisingly firm grasp of contemporary music theory (Schenker, Lerdahl and Jackendoff).\n The result is a rare thing: a book on music aesthetics where both philosophical and\nmusical issues are handled deftly and thoughtfully.",

                "text": "[2] Following the tradition of idealist aesthetics, Scruton grounds his thinking about\n\nmusic on a distinction between sound and tone. Without tone, he says, music cannot\nexist. Tone, moreover, cannot be reduced to sound; instead tone arises from\nsomething we hear in sound when we hear it as music. “A tone is a sound which\nexists within a musical ‘field of force.’ This field of force is something we hear,\nwhen hearing tones” (page 17). Scruton is surely correct to emphasize that music,\nunlike sound, is an “intentional object of musical perception” (page 78). \nConsequently when discussing music, we must, Scruton argues, be careful not to commit the\nerror of mistaking sound for music, that is, the material substrate for the ideal object,\neven though the temptation will be great given the material substantiality of sound.\n“When we hear music, we do not hear sound only; we hear something in sound, something\nwhich moves with a force of its own” (pages 19–20). What precisely is this something?",

                "text": "[3] Tone, according to Scruton, is wholly the product of imagination; it seems to\noccupy a place in some imaginary musical space. Tone is not material, then, but\nidea. Scruton argues that precisely when we must imagine a representational excess\nover the material world, “metaphors seem indispensable . . . because we are using\nthem to describe something other than the material world; in particular because we are\nattempting to describe how the world seems, from the point of view of active\nimagination” (page 91). The experience of sound as music depends radically on our\nimagining the sound as something other than mere sound. “Perception is a\nnatural epistemological power of the organism, which depends on no social context for its\nexercise. The musical experience, however, is not merely perceptual. It is\nfounded in metaphor, arising when unreal movement is heard in imaginary space. Such\nan experience occurs only within a musical culture, in which traditions of performance and\nlistening shape our expectations” (page 239). Metaphor is essential rather than\ncontingent to musical experience, for it is the means of discursively mapping an imaginary\nmusical space. The metaphor cannot be eliminated because music is not a natural\ntype, not wholly contained in the material object. “The indispensable metaphor\noccurs when the way the world seems depends upon an imaginative involvement with it,\nrather than on our ordinary cognitive goals. And this is the case when we listen to\nmusic” (page 92). Music then is something radically human, “the intentional\nobject of an experience that only rational beings can have” (page 96). Sound\nitself is always marked by a deficiency that only the metaphors of music can redeem.\n “It is true that the terms used to describe music refer to material sounds.\n But they refer to them under a description that no material sound can satisfy.\n Sounds do not move as music moves . . . Nor are they organized in a spatial\nway, nor do they rise and fall. Yet this is how we hear them when we hear them as\nmusic” (page 93). This means that “metaphor cannot be eliminated from the\ndescription of music, because it defines the intentional object of the musical\nexperience. Take the metaphor away, and you cease to describe the experience of\nmusic” (page 92).  Consequently, forging metaphorical descriptions of music is\nnever an extra-musical activity but a fundamental aspect of understanding sound as music:\nwithout metaphor there can be no musical descriptions but only descriptions of\nsound. “Metaphor,” Scruton insists, “describes exactly what we hear,\nwhen we hear sounds as music” (page 96).",

                "text": "[4] The central metaphor for describing our experience of music, Scruton argues, is\ntonality. Tonality is the name we give the fictional world of music, the\nmetaphorical order we hear in sound when we hear sound as music. One reason the metaphors\nof tonality are so crucial, Scruton says, is that they permit us to experience music\nspatially. “Tonal harmony enables us to hear simultaneous musical events as\nsimilar or varied; as moving together through a common intentional space; as creating\ntension and resolution, attraction and repulsion; as answering, commenting upon, and\nquestioning each other; as moving with the force and logic of gestures which are mutually\naware, and mutually accommodating. Triadic tonality is not a system of conventions,\narbitrarily devised and imposed by fiat; it is the life-giving air which the voices\nbreathe, and through which they move in dance-like discipline” (page 271). \nTonality permits us to experience music as a “journey through tonal space” (page\n286). Music that lacks tonality, he says, also lacks the “paradigm of musical\norganization” that is tonality. Non-tonal music, in other words, suffers from a\npoverty of organizing metaphors, and Scruton holds this lack more responsible for the\ndifficulties nontonal music has had in finding and sustaining an audience than anything in\nthe actual sound of the music. Moreover, he notes that “attempts to depart from\ntonality, or to discard it entirely, seem only to confirm its authority over the musical\near” (page 239). To the extent that nontonal music remains indebted to tonal\nmetaphors, its organization will seem anti-tonal, that is, a nihilistic negation of\ntonality, whose impulses will continue to be acutely felt as tonal absences.",

                "text": "[5] Scruton directs his critique of nontonal music primarily against serialism, which,\nhe says, determines the sonic order of pitches rather than the musical order of tones.\n Serialism, in other words, orders sound rather than tones, which means that\nserialism is fundamentally incapable of displacing the centrality of the tonal metaphor.\n Serialism in this view becomes a kind of musical utopia that cannot succeed because\nin its enthusiasm to order the material properties of sound, it forgets about tone, which\nconsequently has only an accidental appearance in the music. What is heard in a serial\npiece, Scruton asserts, is often anything but the serial organization. Serial music\noften “[elicits] the ghost of tonal order” (page 296), and we are often\n“hearing against the intellectual structure, and incorporating what we hear into\ntonal or quasi-tonal categories” (page 94). Scruton is no doubt correct that the serial\norganization is often of little apparent musical import, though he perhaps indicts\nserialism too quickly on this count. For Scruton, the lack of connection between\nmusical and intellectual organization of serial music counts as a fatal flaw because it\nsuggests that serialism’s utopian project, a complete transformation of musical listening,\nhas failed. “The purpose of serial organization was precisely to replace the\norder of tonality with an order which, by treating the twelve tones permutationally, would\nconfer equality on each of them. In other words, it was to endow the musical surface with\na new heard order.” (page 296). But this statement of the utopian intentions of\nnontonal composition is not quite persuasive, for it ignores the crucial critical function\nof this utopia as an image of the not-yet, of what might be otherwise.  Equally\nplausibly, it could be asserted that the purpose of serial organization was not so much to\nassert a novel organization of the musical surface as to endow the musical surface with a\nsystemic resistance to tonal order. When Boulez polemically declared that Schoenberg\nwas dead, he did not emphasize the extension of serial procedures as opening up a new\norder of hearing. Rather he argued that total serialism offered a means to avoid\nuncritically reproducing and affirming the old musical order. Boulez, in other words,\nconceived total serialism as the ultimate extension of the critique of tonality that\nSchoenberg had, in Boulez’s opinion, rather too timidly initiated.",

                "text": "[6] By withholding the organizing metaphors tonality grants to music, nontonal music\nregisters a self-reflective ambivalence toward images of social order implicit in\ntonality. Scruton, too, unwittingly concurs with this line of argument: “Atonal\nmusic in the theatre expresses states of mind that are always partly negative: every\nlyrical passage is shot through with anxiety; each loving gesture is also a gesture of\nbetrayal; there is no affirmation of life that does not mask a will to destroy it. \nIt as though anxiety were programmed into this music and can never be wholly\neliminated” (page 306). What Scruton especially disproves is the ambivalence, the\nlack of clear affirmation. Nontonal musics asks, as it were, whether social order is\npossible without coercion. Unlike tonality, which calls forth an image of social harmony,\nas though it were actually present in the world, nontonal music does not affirm this\nimage. In this way, nontonal music understood as a critique of tonality reveals a\nmoment of ideological delusion in tonality, that is, tonality as false utopia. \nScruton cannot acknowledge this possibility except obliquely, when he hears in Berg or\nStravinsky, for instance, “a reading of serialism against itself, so that each\nharmony and motif contains a kind of pointer towards a distant tonal center” (page\n307). Even in these instances he transmutes this effective serialism into a kind of\nnostalgia for a lost tonal order rather than interpreting it as a more determined critique\nof tonal thinking. Yet such music gains its musical power precisely through a\ncritical orientation toward tonality, not because it returns to tonality nostalgically and\nunproblematically.",

                "text": "[7] If Scruton remains unconvinced by the product of nontonal composition, he finds the\nproducts of mass culture equally troubling, and he directs especially nasty barbs at REM,\nNirvana, and heavy metal. Repeating a tired motif of cultural criticism, he\nridicules the substitution of rhythm by beat in popular music and bemoans the\n“decline of popular culture” (page 157), which he understands as having devolved\nfrom the cheerfulness of jazz at the beginning of the century to the nihilistic despair of\nheavy metal and grunge today. “Music soothes, cheers, pacifies; it threatens\nthe power of the monsters, who live by violence and lawlessness. Those lonely,\nantinomian beings are astounded by music, which speaks of another order of being . . . It is\nthis very order that is threatened by the monsters of popular culture. Much modern\npop is cheerless, and meant to be cheerless. But much of it is also a kind of negation of\nmusic, a dehumanizing of the spirit of song” (page 504). Such complaints about\npopular culture are not confined to political conservatives, of course, and Scruton is\naware that his perspective on mass culture is not far removed from Adorno, from whom he\nremains curiously anxious to distance himself. Thus, Scruton claims a qualitative\ndifference between Adorno’s mass culture and the mass culture of today and detects\n“something hasty and undiscriminating in [Adorno’s] dismissal of an entire\nsubculture, as though we could not distinguish the cheerful and life-enhancing sound of\nLouis Armstrong from the monsters of Heavy Metal” (page 480). Yet Scruton too\nhardly prove capable of making distinctions in mass culture today—it is all\n“sentimental and idolatrous” (page 506).",

                "text": "[8] Scruton is more convincing when attempting to refute “the idea of mass culture\nas a ‘bourgeois’ product, and of modernism as the only available answer to it” (page\n469). His intriguing thesis here is that mass culture is not the product of the\nbourgeoisie but of democratic culture. “If you ask yourself seriously, when the\ntransformation of popular music began, the answer would surely be in the twentieth\ncentury, with the reduction of the jazz and blues tradition to a set of repeatable melodic\nand harmonic formulae, held together by a continuous ‘beat.’ This was not a\nbourgeois phenomenon at all, and had less to do with the triumph of capitalism than with\nthe triumph of democracy” (pages 469–70). Scruton, as usual, draws too fine a\ndistinction here, for it is simply implausible that “the masses themselves produced\nthis music” (page 470), as if the productive capacities paid for by the bourgeoisie\nplayed no mediating role in the shift to a consumer-oriented culture. Without the\nphonograph, radio, film and, later, television—all reproductive technologies requiring\ncapital investment far beyond the means (and so control) of the masses, no matter what the\nextent of their representation within the images—mass culture could not exist. And one of\nthe characteristics of mass reproductive media is that they supply not only a product but\nalso help create demand for it. “Spontaneous” artistic production does not\ngenerally occur in mass culture because there is simply too much money at stake. The\nmaxim of the swing band—no practicing on the bandstand—is the general condition of\ncultural production in the era of mechanical reproduction.",

And Scruton, no less than Adorno,\nis forced into cultural retreat if not actual hibernation in the face of consumer\ncapitalism. “High culture,” Scruton writes, “is now the province of a\nminority,” as if this has not always been the case; “those with ears must guard\nthem from the white noise of modern life; and exercise them only in private, or among\nthose like-minded listeners whom they encounter in the concert hall” (page 470). \nCulture, Scruton argues, is in decline because the bourgeoisie are in decline. \n“It is only in certain cultural conditions—those which the bourgeois order most\nreadily promotes, by promoting the prosperity which is the root of leisure—that this\nflowering of the aesthetic impulse can occur” (page 478). Scruton’s nostalgia for\nthe old cultural order blocks critical reflection on it, something Adorno, for all his\nhostility toward mass culture and his reverence for traditional bourgeois culture, never\nforgets: namely, what are the conditions of possibility of leisure time? Or, to put\nit more bluntly, Who pays for it?",

                "text": "[10] Yet it is more productive to read Scruton charitably here as trying to open a\nspace between the two dominant elements of modernist culture, and, to his great credit, he\nstruggles mightily against a mandarin impulse to write off all of democratic culture.\n Mass culture in his view is essentially a product of American cultural hegemony.\n Consequently, he is inclined to treat it as a somewhat unruly step-child of\nEuropean bourgeois culture. The category of taste serves to distinguish these cultures:\n“Democratic culture presses us to accept every taste that does no obvious damage.\n A teacher who criticizes the music of his pupils, or who tries to cultivate, in the\nplace of it, a love for the classics, will be attacked as ‘judgmental.’ In matters\nof aesthetic taste, no adverse judgement is permitted, save judgement of the adverse\njudge. This attitude has helped America to survive and flourish in a world of\nchange. An aristocratic culture has an instinctive aversion to what is vulgar,\nsentimental, or commonplace; not so a democratic culture, which sacrifices good taste to\npopularity, and places no obstacles whatsoever before the ordinary citizen in his quest\nfor a taste of his own” (page 497). Although his sympathies clearly lie on the\nside of bourgeois, aristocratic taste, Scruton does occasionally describe democratic\nculture in almost heroic terms, as the triumph of freedom, though his celebratory tone in\nsuch instances is always tempered: democratic freedom is not a freedom he himself can\nfully embrace, nor really even comprehend: “What I have described is not the\ndecadence of popular music, but its final freedom—its breaking-loose from the channel of\ntaste, into the great ocean of equality, where the writ of taste no longer runs. The\npostmodern world denatures music only because it denatures everything, in order that each\nindividual might have his chance to buy and sell. Popular music ceases to be music,\njust as sexual love ceases to be love: nothing less than this is required by the new form\nof life—the fear, inadequacy, and anger that attend the attempt to live without the\nblessing of the dead—is itself expressed by the popular culture and reabsorbed by it.\n The cheerlessness of so much pop music is therapeutic: an acknowledgement that we\nlive outside society, that we too, in granting equality to every human type, have become\nmonsters, and that a monster is an OK thing to be” (pages 504–5). Scruton, of course,\ncannot sustain this thought and I suspect he stated it even here with tongue placed firmly\nin cheek. For Scruton’s larger purpose is to fight for the soul of American culture,\nto instill in it an image of culture as something better than what is, and to promote\ntaste as something worth having. This goal helps make sense of the strange ending of\nthe book where instead of resolution we find a piling up of difficult problems that follow\nfrom the collapse of high modernist culture.",

                "text": "[11] The difficulty of Scruton’s conclusion can perhaps be best seen in his discussion\nof sentimentality. Sentimentality, he writes, “is a vice. Not only does\nit place someone at a distance from reality; it also involves an overvaluation of the self\nat the cost of others. The other person enters the orbit of the sentimentalist as an\nexcuse for emotion, rather than an object of it. The other is deprived of his\nobjectivity as a person, and absorbed into the subjectivity of the sentimentalist. \nThe other becomes, in a very real sense, a means to emotion, rather than an end in\nhimself” (page 486). The problem with sentimentality, then, is that it\ninstrumentalizes the other. To his credit, Scruton realizes that popular and high\nart are both often sentimental. “We are all to some extent\nsentimentalists” (page 488). Sentimentality in Scruton’s reading turns out to be a kind\nof defense against the (post)modern world. It allows us to surmount intractable\ndifficulties by saying: “let us pretend” (page 488). Yet his account of\nsentimentality leaves him in something of a quandary. On the one hand, he cannot\nreally wish directly for the restoration of bourgeois culture without lapsing into\nsentimental nostalgia for the lost order. But on the other hand, he cannot endorse\nthe “faint sarcastic smile” (page 492), the cynical reason, the return to\n“‘tonality’ in inverted commas” (page 490) in neo-romanticism because in the\nawareness that comes with quotation, a crucial element of innocence is lost. \nComposition in inverted commas, he says, instrumentalizes emotion, becomes another\ninstantiation of sentimentality. Tonality is no longer possible when it is heard as\n“tonality.” “The fact that an innocent stance towards the world is\nunavailable, makes music uncomposable. That which music expresses has gone from the world;\nand so music too must go” (page 491). Scruton attributes this “death”\nof music to the triumph of democratic culture and the leveling of taste that goes with it,\nbut it is equally possible that such loss of faith, as it might be called, has as much to\ndo with a general reflection of democratic culture on its own conditions of possibility.\n “Tonality” registers, as it were, the necessity and impossibility of our\nexperience of the modern world: that we must negotiate that world using organizing\nmetaphors that we know at some level to be ideologically suspect and false, but that also\nremain useful and at some level even indispensable.",

He claims to\ndetect signs that “a new bourgeois order is emerging—one which does not feel the\nforce of modernism’s bleak alternatives. It is a fragile audience: its ears muddied\nby pop music, its body starved of rhythm, its soul untutored in religious hope.

                "text": "[13] This brings me to a final point and that has to do with the critical\ninterpretation of music, something about which Scruton offers many important insights.\n While Scruton is largely dismissive of authors such as Adorno and McClary who seek\namong other things to understand the way ideology becomes manifest as music, their\ncomplaints against the narrowness and the illusion of “value-free” analysis are\nlargely accepted by Scruton. Indeed, for Scruton, hearing music as music requires the\n“background assumption” of musical value. Consequently, Scruton has as\nlittle patience for a “value-free” analysis of music as has Adorno or McClary:\n“A willed neutrality is a kind of judgement, and critics with a political judgement\nare rightly suspicious of scholarship which forbids us to ask the pressing\nquestions—questions concerning meaning and value—which trouble our listening\nhabits” (page 365). Like Adorno or McClary, Scruton pushes description into\nevaluation, suggesting that the language with which we describe music cannot be separated\nfrom our evaluation of it because the whole point of musical description is to get the\nreader to hear the music as the author does. “Aesthetic description is an immovable\npart of critical practice, and can be distinguished from aesthetic evaluation only with\ndifficulty, and only at the risk of isolating the evaluative judgement and emptying it of\ncontent. The good critic is not the one who ranks works of music in an order of\nmerit, or assigns credit marks to each, but the one who alters our perception of the thing\nwe hear, so as to persuade us of his judgement” (pages 372–3). In terms of\nanalysis, Scruton recommends seeking out not deep structures, which explain surface\nstructures, but latent structures, which actually form part of the surface. Such\nstructures, Scruton argues, “are structures we can be brought to hear in the surface,\nas we broaden our musical understanding, and begin to notice relations that are more\nsubtle than those which immediately strike the ear. An analysis of latent structure\nis also a piece of music criticism. For it aims to bring into salience what is\nimportant in the music, and to lead us to hear with greater understanding. It\neffects an adjustment in the intentional object—and could indeed be compared to the work\nof psychoanalysis, in bringing into consciousness the full matter of the musical\nresponse” (page 425). The convergence between critics such as Adorno or McClary, whose\npolitics he despises, and his own position, is nowhere stronger than in his attempt to\nsharpen the critical dimension of analysis: “Analysis makes sense, therefore,\nonly as a prelude to criticism. Criticism begins and ends in an elaborate act of\nostention. The critic asks us to notice certain things, and to hear them\ndifferently” (page 428). Ideological critics, Scruton says, act responsibly to\nthe extent that they seek to transform our hearing, to the extent that they make us hear\ndifferently rather than simply imposing an ideological reading on the material whether it\nfits or not. Yet Scruton’s complaint really amounts to nothing more than pointing\nout that poor ideological criticism exists—certainly nothing to be surprised about.",

If Scruton finds Marxian accounts of history implausible, as having\nbeen left in the dustbin of history, then it is also true that his own ideologically\nconservative historiography is equally bankrupt. What then are we to make of this\nsituation? A pervasive skepticism towards the ultimate truth of the large organizing\nmetanarratives that drive thought defines the peculiar quality of the postmodern\ncondition, a kind of living in quotation marks: it is difficult to accept any grand theory\nas anything more than a working hypothesis that is evaluated pragmatically, less in terms\nof its general truth than in the particular insights that it allows. If Scruton\nstands on no firmer intellectual ground than those he labels Marxists, then this perhaps\naccounts for why the careful reasoning and measured tone he otherwise employs in the book\nalways gives way to invective whenever he confronts political criticism with which he\ndisagrees. “Some of ‘culture’ is the unintended by-product of social order; but\nmuch of it, including art, is freely intended. And that which is freely intended is\nalways more than ideology, even if it is also ideology. A work of art may express\nand endorse the social conditions which gave rise to it; but it may also question\nthem” (page 430). Few ideological critics would disagree with Scruton’s truism so\nfar as it goes, certainly not Adorno, the implied target. Indeed, the idea of a\ncritical function for art, the questioning of social conditions through artistic autonomy,\nis at the heart of Adorno’s defense of great art. But Scruton continues: \n“and if it is a great work of art, it will transcend [the social conditions] entirely\nto see into the human heart. Its meaning as ideology may be what interests us least,\nwhen we see it as a work of art” (page 430). Even granting that ideology is\nindeed what interests us least when we hear music as music, it might still prove\ninstructive to inquire into this disinterest—its conditions of possibility, say—to\nunderstand how music can be heard as music in the first place, and to measure the social\ninterest of hearing with disinterest. Art, too, bears a social cost. Leisure,\nas Scruton knows, lies near the heart of the matter, but he remains blind to the full\nramifications of the category, in particular, that the distribution of leisure time is not\nequitable.",

                "text": "[15] Here, then, we return to Scruton’s initial premise, the division of tone and\nsound, which had at first seemed so plausible and intuitively correct. In fact, this\ndivision is not so innocent, which does not mean that we can do without it. While\nproblematic, the premise remains absolutely indispensable. Scruton is certainly\nright that music does not exist without tone; when we listen to sound as music, we all\nnecessarily become idealists. Yet just because we must hear tone in sound if we are\nto hear sound as music does not mean that we should take the separation of sound and tone\nas an unproblematic given. Instead, the aesthetics of music needs to be pushed to\nself-reflection on the point so that the irreducible idealism of hearing music in sound is\ndisenchanted. With self-reflection, idealism turns into its opposite, revealing the\nsocial conditions that sustain it, indeed that make it possible in the first place.",
