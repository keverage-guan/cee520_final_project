    "abstract": "This paper investigates a fairly common but seldom-studied rhythmic notation in the nineteenth-century piano literature, in which duplets in one voice occur against triplets in another, and the second duplet shares its notehead with the third triplet—a logical impossibility, as the former note should theoretically fall halfway through the beat, the latter two-thirds of the way. Examples are given from the works of several composers, especially Brahms, who employed such notations throughout his career. Several alternative realizations are discussed and demonstrated in audio examples; the most appropriate performance strategy is seen to vary from one example to another. Impossibilities of type1⁄2=2⁄3,as described above, are the most common, but many other types occur. Connections between such rhythmic impossibilities and the controversy surrounding assimilation of dotted rhythms and triplets are considered; the two phenomena are related, but typically arise in different repertoires. A few other types of impossible notations are shown, concluding with an example from Scriabin’s Prelude in C Major, op. 11, no. 1, in which triplets and quintuplets occur in complex superposition. The notation implies several features of alignment that cannot all be realized at once; recorded examples illustrate that a variety of realizations are viable in performance.",

A few other differences between the two editions are worth mentioning, though they bear less significantly, if at all, on the analysis here. In the Simrock, the left-hand triplets are beamed in groups of nine, spanning an entire measure, rather than in groups of three as in Breitkopf. (Nine-measure phrases with nine notes to the bar, as in the triplet voice in this variation, are an extraordinarily rare circumstance.) In some measures Simrock reverses the stem directions in the left hand, stemming the triplets upward and the duplets downward. In measure 5, Simrock gives the 32 nd -note subtriplet to the triplet voice while in Breitkopf it belongs to the duplet voice. (This subtriplet imitates the grace notes of measure 3, though not in inversion.) After measure 11 Simrock abandons the left hand’s duplet beams entirely, but even after that point the third triplets nearly align with the right hand’s duplets. Finally, the Breitkopf score shows an incorrect placement of the first ending in the variation’s final system; this has been corrected in Example 1 to match Simrock.",

In the absence of other cues, Western-enculturated listeners are known to show a preference for binary metric groupings ( Huron 2006 , 195–96), so that a note placement that is mathematically closer to a triplet may nevertheless be perceived as a duplet.",

London reports the results of studies showing that “the lower limit for meter, that is, the shortest interval that we can hear or perform as an element of a rhythmic figure, is about 100 milliseconds” (0.1 seconds)—approximately the length of the 32 nd notes in Example 18—but that separate tones can be discerned, and variation in interonset intervals between two sounds can be discriminated, with much finer precision, heavily dependent on musical context London 2004 , 27). Friberg and Sundberg 1995 show that in the context of a steady stream of pulses, the jnd is about 2.5 percent of the interonset interval between pulses, down to a minimum jnd of about 6 milliseconds (0.006 seconds). A listener hearing one performance at a time cannot directly judge an offset between attack points in two separate performances of an excerpt such as Example 18, but the variation in the lengths of triplets performed in a 3:2:3 ratio as in Example 19b, even at the rapid tempo of this example, is significant enough to be perceived with little difficulty.",

When a mathematician says that something is impossible, it means the thing involves some inherent logical contradiction. Adding two even numbers and getting an odd number, for example, is impossible, no matter how much one practices one’s addition. This paper, accordingly, is not about rhythms that are merely very difficult , as might be encountered in the music of Elliott Carter or Brian Ferneyhough. Rather, it is about rhythms with the curious property that, no matter how faultless a performer’s mental metronome and digital dexterity may be, it is logically, mathematically, absolutely impossible to play exactly what the composer wrote.

One voice, written with stems up, moves in sixteenth notes, duple subdivisions of the beat in the moderately slow 8 3 meter. The other voice, with stems down, moves in sixteenth-note triplets —triple subdivisions of the same beat. Two-against-three polyrhythms are commonplace in Brahms, and generally there is nothing impossible about them. But a predicament arises here because the two voices share many noteheads, as shown more abstractly in Example 2 . No harm is done when the first duplet coincides with the first triplet, as those two notes should be struck at the same moment anyhow. There could perhaps be a question about how long this doubled initial note should be sustained, but that question is not my concern here, and at any rate it pales in comparison with the dilemma that rears its head upon the arrival of the third note. When the third triplet shares its notehead with the second duplet, as it does repeatedly throughout this variation, something is amiss, because these two notes should theoretically be articulated at two different times. The numbers in Example 2 indicate points on a time axis (not durations); time is measured in eighth notes from the most recent downbeat, in both voices independently. The second duplet should theoretically fall on the half-beat, while the third triplet should not be struck until two-thirds of the way through the beat—so Brahms’s notation implies that a single articulation somehow occurs at two different temporal positions, as represented by the mathematical impossibility 1 ⁄ 2 = 2 ⁄ 3 .",

The added keystroke is pianistically ungraceful at best, and the audio example should be sufficient to convince the reader that 3a is not what Brahms intended, and not a realistic option in performance. The example is nevertheless instructive as a sort of unrealizable ideal, a paradigm of the two-against-three polyrhythm implied by the notation. If the final notes of the duplet and triplet groups did not coincide—if, say, the third triplet were B instead of E—then a strict polyrhythmic performance analogous to Example 3a would be unproblematic; it would, in fact, be the only rhythmically “correct” way to play the passage.

At 3c the middle triplet is positioned midway between the first and third, so it too arrives early. At 3d the middle triplet is restored to its proper triplet position, creating an incomplete triplet in counterpoint with the duplet. Example 3d thus resembles 3a, but lacks the rearticulation of the duplicated note. Aurally, the incomplete triplet in 3d may be difficult to perceive as a triplet; this attack rhythm is perhaps more likely to be perceived as shown in 3d′, where a 32 nd -note triplet subdivision within the first duplet implies a sixfold subdivision of the beat.",

Above all, it is reasonable to ask what a pianist should do when playing this variation. On the evidence of op. 21, no. 1’s modest discographic record, the path of least resistance seems to be that of Example 3b: take the fastest notes—the triplets—at face value, letting the duplets fall where they may. As justification for this reading, one might say that the duplet notation is to be read not as a strict metrical prescription, but only as an indication of grouping or voice leading involving a subset of the triplets. Furthermore, because the right hand plays only duplets, it could be argued that the left hand must project the triplets accurately in order for the basic two-against-three conflict to be heard. Some might suggest also that instead of reading too much into Brahms’s choice of note values we should be reading the visual alignment of the score: in Example 1 the second duplet in each right-hand pair, rather than aligning with the second duplet (third triplet) in the left hand, typically falls instead between the second and third triplets, consistent with a triplet-priority performance of the left-hand rhythm. Indeed, of the alternatives in Example 3, it is 3b that most closely approximates the way this rhythm is played in every recorded performance of which I am aware. Wilhelm Backhaus’s 1935 performance, sans repeats, is offered as an example (listen to Audio Example 1a ). Audio Example 1 .

First, as Brahms tells us, the variation is a canone in moto contrario , a canon in inversion, and it is the left hand’s duplets, not the triplets, that imitate the subject in the right hand (which also moves in duplets). Occasionally, as in measure 4, the canonic voices proceed in parallel tenths, and so presumably should move in the same note values. Scrutiny of Simrock’s 1861 first edition of the work, shown in Example 8 , is revealing. Although essentially the same impossible notation appears in the Simrock as in the more recent Breitkopf edition of Example 1, the alignment of the notes is distinctly different: in most cases Simrock’s right-hand duplets align closely with the left-hand duplets (and therefore with the third triplet in each group) rather than falling between the triplets as in Example 1.

Structurally, the two voices in the left hand are not the lines indicated by the stems and beams at all: rather, the duplets form one voice, and the other is the bass line, consisting of the middle triplets only, as accompaniment to the canon. (Reading the duplets and triplets as independent voices results in a great number of dubious parallel unisons.) Backhaus’s performance, like most others, accentuates the right-hand melody over a continuous carpet of relatively undifferentiated triplets. In practice, the more one wishes to bring out the imitating voice in the canon (the upper voice in the left hand), the more one would like to hear that voice moving in a rhythm of equal duplets.",

The repeats, in contrast, give prominence to the imitating voice in the canon, now played in duplets. In the repeats the placement of the middle triplets approximately as in Example 3d highlights the independence of this third voice and forces the bass notes to be short, perhaps conjuring the image of a pizzicato cello accompanying the canon.

Studies of performance practice such as Rosenblum 1988 and Brown 1999 , meanwhile, have much to tell us about historically appropriate interpretations of various notational conventions, rhythmic and otherwise. The literally impossible nature of a notation such as that in Example 1, however, seems to have escaped scholarly attention. This neglect is perhaps attributable in part to the admittedly fussy nature of the subject, which may appear to depend on a literal-minded reading of notation at the most microscopic scale. The conundrum for the performer is nevertheless a real one—literal-minded or not, one must somehow decide what to play—and the general disregard for the question becomes more remarkable with the realization of just how common such notations actually are in the Romantic piano literature. A rather cursory scan through this repertoire turned up examples of impossible rhythms in works by Schubert, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Robert and Clara Schumann, Liszt, Franck, Brahms, Fauré, MacDowell, Debussy, Sibelius, Amy Beach, Rachmaninov, Ravel, Ernő Dohnányi, Nicolas Medtner, and Karol Szymanowski.

One can, of course, play a note that is neither halfway through a beat nor two-thirds of the way, but somewhere in between; it may be possible for listeners to hear such a note as either a duplet or a triplet depending on various contextual and cognitive considerations, in a sort of auditory illusion comparable to many well-known optical illusions that can be perceived in two distinct ways.

As an illustration, consider the single impossible notation in measure 24 of Example 12 , which occurs at the cadence marking the end of the first section of a ternary-form composition, where an expressive ritard is appropriate. In the \naccompanying audio example, the listener who attends to the triplets may hear the C ♯ as a triplet, arriving nearly in tempo, but by attending instead to the eighth-note duplets, one may hear the same note as a duplet with a modest ritard . The listener may therefore experience at least the illusion of the ideal two-against-three polyrhythm, an illusion that is perhaps exactly the intent of Brahms’s notation.

In each five-note group the last duplet coincides with the last triplet, forming a 1 ⁄ 2 = 2 ⁄ 3 impossibility like the previous examples. But the first duplet in each group falls on the second half-beat following the rest, where it coincides not with the third but with the second triplet of the beat, creating a different species of impossibility, 1 ⁄ 2 = 1 ⁄ 3 . The two types of conflict occur in pairs a total of fourteen times in measures 51–59 of this song.

A similar sort of melodic displacement arises in Example 16, where again many melody notes seem to fall a sixth of a beat late. Here, however, Schumann notates the rhythm of the melody without contradiction, the more exact notation perhaps necessitated by the slower tempo, which makes the sixth-beat discrepancies more apparent.

Another distinctive feature of Example 22, found occasionally in Chopin and some other composers, is the proliferation of extra stems and beams indicating fragmentary inner voices. Often the note values in these surplus voices do not add up to whole beats in any coherent way. It seems clear that the purpose of the extra beams is to underline the transitory voices, not to show precise metrical positioning, so the note values must not be read too literally—an observation that could have some bearing on some other impossible-rhythm examples as well.

The alignment of the notes in Chopin’s well-known autograph of the E-major Prelude, shown in part in Example 23 , has led many people to conclude that Chopin expected the dotted rhythms to be assimilated to the triplets. Close examination of this autograph shows that some noteheads are double-stemmed, shared between the two conflicting rhythms, thus qualifying them as impossible rhythms of the 2 ⁄ 3 = 3 ⁄ 4 type, comparable to Example 20. Elsewhere, though, assimilation is implied only by vertical alignment. About this alignment there is substantial disagreement among the various published editions of the Prelude; most editions eliminate Chopin’s double-stemming entirely. (13)",

Assimilators claim support for their position in the very existence of notations such as that in Example 24 , where the 2 ⁄ 3 = 3 ⁄ 4 notation at measure 81 requires assimilation. Shared-note impossibilities of this sort are rare in Schubert, however. The assimilation question arises far more often in situations like Example 25 , where performers may choose to assimilate or not. As in the Chopin example, editors are forced to take sides, as the two editions of “Wasserflut” in Example 26 demonstrate. The non-assimilatory notation in the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe elicited a critical rejoinder from Paul Badura-Skoda ( 1992 ), a longtime advocate of assimilation. (15)",

Noteheads shared between two voices played by a single musician are an essential feature of these examples, essentially limiting their scope to music for the keyboard, and indeed, the repertoires in which the two problems arise are nearly complementary. The assimilation problem is generally supposed by those on all sides of the controversy essentially to end with Schubert, excepting only an occasional slightly later example such as the Chopin Prelude. Brown gives several examples intended to show that later composers such as Mendelssohn, Schumann, Berlioz, and Brahms differentiated their note values more scrupulously ( Brown 1999 , 616–21). Impossible rhythms of the shared-notehead variety, on the other hand, really pick up steam only after the time of Schubert. As the examples above suggest, I have found more such notations in the music of Brahms than in any other composer, spanning his career from the Sonata, op. 1, to the very last page of the Vier ernste Gesänge , op. 121. Some of the characteristics for which Brahms is celebrated seem ideally suited to the formation of impossible rhythms: he was fond of polyrhythms and contrapuntal textures, and often wrote multiple voices on one staff. Brahms’s scores might be described as being denser in information content than those of many other composers of his time, and an impossible rhythm is essentially a case of too much information—so much, in fact, that some of it becomes contradictory. Notational complexity is hardly surprising in an era when rhythmic notation bears greater burdens than ever before, but it is remarkable in this climate of notational “precision” that this complexity so often produces instructions whose precise observance is theoretically unattainable.

Evidently these two notes, like those that follow, are intended to sound in octave doubling, played by both hands in the same rhythm. But this alignment is at odds with Franck’s note values: the sixteenth notes in the left hand, as part of a larger triplet, are theoretically shorter than those in the right. The alignment implies the impossible equations 1 ⁄ 2 = 2 ⁄ 3 and 3 ⁄ 4 = 5 ⁄ 6 . The previous note is also problematic: the positioning of the left hand’s chord before the right hand’s D ♭ erroneously implies that 1 ⁄ 3 is smaller than 1 ⁄ 4 . Example 27b corrects the alignment to match the given note values (which are unchanged)—but it seems highly doubtful that this revised alignment reflects Franck’s intentions. The suggested revision in Example 27c restores the alignment of the sixteenth notes by unshackling them from the triplets, although the alignment at the previous note remains different from the published score.

The meter change here is from 8 7 to 8 5 , one 8 5 bar in the winds occupying the time of a 4 2 bar in the rest of the orchestra. The problem is that eighth notes at five-in-the-time-of-four are of necessity slightly faster than the previous seven-in-the-time-of-six. If the note values are to stay the same in the 4 3 parts, therefore, the note values in the piccolo and oboes cannot stay the same as instructed, but must speed up slightly. A further quickening, to eight-in-the-time-of-six, is implied in the 8 8 bar two measures later (where the woodwind melody is joined for the first time by a trumpet). The changes to this point might be absorbed into the general poco a poco accelerando marked at measure 30, but the subsequent reversion to 8 7 implies that the woodwind eighth notes get slower again before cycling irregularly through all three configurations in the following measures. Although the 7:6 and 5:4 polyrhythms are unlikely to be heard clearly at this tempo, the required variation in the length of the woodwinds’ eighth notes is significant enough that the players must be aware of it—even if it cannot be deduced from the music in front of them. To the listener, this fluctuation is especially evident in measures 32 and 33, because the eight melody notes in the former measure occupy the same span of time as seven in the latter (a constant 4 3 measure in the rest of the orchestra: only the piccolo, oboe, and trumpet parts show a meter change at measure 33).

Consequently the first triplet in each group must fall at the 3 ⁄ 5 point.

The half-note beats are projected with some clarity in the right hand, reinforced by details such as the tenuto marks near the beginning of the piece and octave doublings near the end. In measure 20 and again in measure 22, a prominent 4–3 inner-voice resolution in the left hand seems to warrant a position of metric strength; this inner-voice motion has been heard since measure 2, where the same F and E, embedded in the left-hand quintuplets, fell clearly on the beats. The low C in the final measure of the piece will be heard as a downbeat no matter what, but this is simply the next quarter note in line, so if it falls on a beat, presumably other notes in corresponding locations should be similarly positioned. Finally, the misalignment of the triplet and quintuplet groups (“not X”) in Example 35 is defensible: the slight delay between the right- and left-hand attacks represents the most common kind of asynchrony in piano performance (called a “melody lead” in Palmer 1996 ), and allows the player a little more time to negotiate the large leaps in the left hand at the end of measures 18, 19, and 21 without disrupting the flow of quintuplets in the right.",

An impossible rhythm was described earlier as a case of too much information. From the performer’s point of view, paradoxically, too much information is very like too little information: it means that one has to make a choice. Or, perhaps better, one gets to make a choice. At the outset I adopted the stance of a mathematician, but it is as a performer faced with making practical decisions about every detail of a score that I find myself most tantalized by impossible rhythms. Performers are accustomed to making choices about many things, but the basic meaning of rhythmic notation is not usually among them. This exceptional freedom of interpretive choice is one of the things that I find appealing about these rhythms, and ultimately it may be the best answer to the question of what they mean.",
