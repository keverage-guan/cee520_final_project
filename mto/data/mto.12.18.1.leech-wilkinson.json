    "abstract": "The standard model of musical transmission, in which composers embody their intentions in works which they encode in scores which performers (and scholars in their imagination) decode as accurately as possible for audiences, is unpicked in the light of the evidence of recorded performance. It is replaced with a model that recognizes the large extent to which performances trigger the generation of musical meaning in the minds of listeners, and the extent to which changes in performance style cause those meanings to change. Some implications for thought about music are considered.",

The sense that a performance worked (for us today, that is) generates a sense of entering into the composer’s mental world (which may, in fact, have felt very different). A rich example, including the notion of a disc as a vehicle for spiritual transport, comes from a record review by Rob Cowan: “Every now and again the flames that lick at the heart of Beethoven’s late quartets need to be rekindled. The Takacs Quartet meet that need. They probe, ponder and play; attend to the letter but the spirit always comes first—you can hear how in the sensitivity of their phrasing, the vitality of their attack, their humility in the face of the music’s abundant mystery. Were I to tempt new listeners out of the everyday into Beethoven’s exalted world, the Takacs would be my preferred digital carriers” ( Cowan 2005 ). The attitude can be seen permeating many of the nineteenth-century quotations included in Hunter 2005 . The longevity of the notion simply emphasizes that to feel this sense of reaching the composer’s understanding of her/his score supplies a significant psychological need.",

I say “still” because there has been a lot of research, and a fair number of publications over the past two decades, that raise doubts about that easy assumption, yet none of it seems to have made much difference to the way scores are taught, analyzed, or discussed. Studies of specific instances of musical affect frequently treat the composer as if s/he were the principal agent of meaning. “Schubert lingers affectively on this glimpse of bucolic happiness, though without slackening the pace of the song” ( Kramer 1998 , 129). “Beethoven hurls forth the P 0 module, Allegro vivace , in a set of three impetuous, downward-cast precipitations, measures 1–8” ( Hepokoski 2010 , 11). Clearly the composer, in this idealized world in which musicologists and music theorists often imagine music, is also already the performer. The writer tells us how the piece should sound—“should” because the conception is attributed to the composer as performer.  However far we may think we have come from the days when composers’ intentions drove critical commentary, the model in which performance, at its best, realizes composers’ conceptions specified in scores ( Figure 1a ) seems remarkably resilient, a meme that happily reproduces in the minds of successive generations of teachers, students and listeners.",

One might expect them to be only too happy to take more credit for their own creative contribution. But in fact the psychological advantages of being able to justify their choices by attributing them to the composer—treating the score as divine law (soli Deo gloria)—seem far to outweigh the uncertain likelihood of critical praise that might or might not accrue to them were there no higher authority to whom they could look for support. When a performance seems particularly persuasive the tendency remains to assume a particularly successful match of performer’s choice and composer’s intention: the performer, we suppose, has penetrated deep into the true nature of the work. (1) When there is debate about the realization of a particular passage, it typically becomes debate about what the composer intends there. (The present tense, so commonly used in that debate, only emphasizes the unreality of it, given that the composer is usually long gone.) Yet every performer who has worked with living composers knows that more often than not they are delighted to be offered interpretations that they had not intended but that, when they hear them, they rather like, or even prefer to their own (if they had one). (2) Dead composers, however, become saints, and their visions become sure as a result: we just need to commune with them with a pure heart and the right sounds will emerge. (3)",

Only the elderly could recall that performances had once behaved very differently. (4) For over a century now, (5) however, the virus of recordings has been reproducing quietly in the background, worming its way into our musical lives by apparently bringing innumerable benefits, economic and artistic, which far outweigh minor local damage (a declining willingness to read scores, for example). Only now, when there are so many recordings that a long past of performance practice has been realistically exposed to us for the first time, are we faced with the real damage that recordings are going to—must—do to existing notions of the nature of musical compositions. For what we now see, beyond any question, is that while the notes may remain the same, the music made from them changes: over long periods of time it changes more than even our most progressive current thinking about compositions and their contexts encourages us to suppose.

When Hofmann, Marx, Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner were writing about Beethoven, were they really hearing the same musical sounds, or hearing musical sounds in the same way, still less hearing them as Schenker, Adorno, Kerman, or McClary were variously to hear them, as ways of playing Beethoven changed significantly for each of their generations?

I have tried previously to show how, in both Schubert and Boulez performance, radical changes in the sound of scores, leading to a different set of impressions for listeners, were followed decades later by changes in the way those scores were written about ( Leech-Wilkinson 2009b ). In the Schubert case the Second World War—perhaps not coincidentally—marks a watershed between a naïve lyricist whose songs faithfully depict the stories told in their texts and a troubled man with dark longings whose music depicts far more than the texts seem to say. Here Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was a key figure whose recordings presented layers of meaning unknown to his predecessors, which writers, after many years of assimilation, began to explore. The Boulez case is more complex, for his development as a composer and a conductor are intertwined, both moving away from pointillism to lyricism: it remains to be shown, but seems distinctly possible, that Boulez the performer led the way. A similar case to these two could very possibly be made for many other composers and repertoires. Consider, for example, the reception of French Baroque music before and after Les Arts Florissants and their successors; Machaut before and after Gothic Voices; Mahler before and after Bernstein and Haitink; Bach before and after Harnoncourt. These are not the same composers as before. Figure 2 (click to enlarge)",

Performers generally read less about music than writers hear of it, (9) but while that may be another reason why performers lead the way, we might be wise now to reconsider the extent to which scores tell us anything at all about what is inherent to a particular composition beyond the approximate pitches and durations that its composer was able to abstract from what s/he imagined.

Because as soon as we start to think about the relationships between notes we have to imagine those notes sounding. And as soon as we imagine music sounding we imagine it in a particular performance style, the performance style current around us, more particularly, I suggest, the style current around us when our ideas about what is ideally musical became fully formed, which for many musicians will be in their twenties.

Experimental studies of music imagining or “audiation” are at an early stage, but a shared finding is that imagining music engages, in experienced musicians, neural networks also involved in performance ( Brodsky et al. 2008 ; Langheim et al. 2002 ), hardly a surprising finding but one that emphasizes the strong link between imagining music and real music-making. While in imagining scores it is possible to stretch out or compress passages that engage our attention to differing extents, this kind of selective focus, while useful for analytical purposes, has limited ecological value except in so far as rubato on a much narrower scale can be applied to produce expressive performance. The better we are at imagining sound as performed, the more realistic will be our judgments about the functional and meaningful relationships between notes. Many score readers are very good indeed (think of the aural imagination acquired by an experienced conductor).",

With all our upbringing stressing that this is so, it will seem only natural to agree with Michael Spitzer that “one may surely concede that musical materials and processes—perhaps even when they are disposed in a “work”—can have emotional properties in themselves” ( Spitzer 2010 , 2). But how, and to what extent? Gabrielsson and Lindström ( 2010 ) review over 100 studies that relate musical materials and expressive response. Most involve responding to human performances, so the test materials are not unmediated by performance expression; but the enormous weight of evidence that different styles of musical materials trigger different expressive associations and responses leaves little doubt that relationships between notes do some of the expressive work. Some of the findings concern cross-cultural tests in which members of one culture were able to discern something of the intended expression in music of another ( Fritz et al. 2009 ). We can add to this the evidence of lullabies, which have musical features in common across many world cultures ( Unyk et al. 1992 ; Trehub et al. 1993 ). But there too performance style is a major contributing factor: lullabies share not just “compositional” features (higher average pitch than in most songs, melodic simplicity and repetitiveness, fewer changes in pitch direction, more descending intervals) but also pitch-glides (portamenti) and stronger lower harmonics in their singing ( Trehub et al. 1997 ; Leech-Wilkinson 2006 ).",

Moreover experiments by several groups have been highly successful in showing that different manners of performance of the same musical material can trigger very different (and accurate) assessments by listeners of the intended emotional expression ( Juslin and Timmers 2010 ).

There are strong traditions in the performing of particular scores, it is assumed that these represent the composer’s intentions which are believed to be of overriding importance, and thus there is a strong moral imperative not to perform scores non-traditionally. Small adjustments to norms are sought after by young players seeking to be noticed, but anything obvious is counterproductive: performers who dared to offer a radically different view would be slapped down by performance police (teachers, critics, bloggers) and spurned by potential employers (agents, conductors, ensembles, venue managers, record and radio producers).

Nothing makes this clearer than the gulf between early twentieth-century treatises and recordings by their authors, for example Lilli Lehmann’s ( 1902 ), Leopold Auer’s ( 1921 ), or Carl Flesch’s ( 1924 ). Once we can hear the manner of performance a treatise attempts to describe it becomes obvious that even highly detailed teaching texts (and these are much more detailed than their eighteenth-century counterparts) come nowhere near specifying a performance style: nothing Lehmann tells us in How to Sing , or Auer in Violin Playing as I Teach It , prepares us for the (by modern standards) extraordinary sounds they make on disc. This underlines the impossibility of arriving, from reading texts, even from playing the instruments, at anything remotely like Bach’s performance stylistic world, however much students of “historical” (i.e., imagined, pre-recording) performance practice may assert the opposite. (13) But we live within a tradition of performing the “Crucifixus” a particular way, and, whatever the status they allow historical evidence, it is hard to imagine a circumstance in which performers today would feel able to confound an audience’s expectations of such a sacred text by making it sound radically different. So here, as in the vast majority of the classical canon, we are simply not being given a chance to find out how differently notes could communicate meanings to us. Beyond the hints offered by early recordings, we do not know what is possible. And so long as we do not know we (scholars) should be much more wary of making assumptions about what scores mean. Of course I have taken an emotive example. But how much truer must this be of music without a regulatory text, for example a fugue or a sonata movement?",

In principle there is a simple way to test the extent to which the expressive content of scores (unmediated by performance) can be identified; that is to play them in a plain MIDI encoding without variation in pitch, loudness, timbre, or timing. But even here there are several contaminating factors. It is unavoidable to choose a playback speed, which can make a big difference to one’s assumptions about musical meaning, so several speeds would need to be tried, including speeds outside current norms. Participants would be likely to bring a sense of expressivity to scores they know, hearing the MIDI as if it were an expressive performance, so an unknown score would be a better choice. Even so, knowledge of current performance practice in similar scores is likely to inflect responses. You would need a lot of participants in order to assess the expressive character(s) of the piece with some confidence in the findings. In designing the experiment you would need to choose between forced choice and open responses, the latter preferable but harder to analyze. What emerged might, despite these qualifications, be very interesting. It would inevitably be influenced by the current performance tradition of similar scores, so there is no escaping performance style entirely. But it would be a better test than none. A sensible hypothesis, since it accords with all assumptions to date, would be that the pitch and duration information in the score does afford a constrained range of moods, emotions or associations. But the findings are far from guaranteed.",

( 2008 ) came closest in using fifty-six especially composed fragments intended to represent specific emotions and to “convey emotions by virtue of their musical structure and not their musical expressivity” (724). They were played to fifty-nine students, thirty-two of whom had no musical training, via a MIDI sequencer set to piano sound and without any variation in loudness or tempo. A large majority of participants had no difficulty in distinguishing and recognizing the emotions represented. Although they did not try an inexpressive control, Bresin and Friberg ( 1999 ), examining the other side of the coin, showed that listeners were very successful at recognizing six different emotional states modeled by different (synthesized) performances of the same (contrasting) melodies (see also Bresin and Friberg 2000 ; Juslin 1997 ). We can draw two useful, if provisional conclusions from these studies; first that compositional structure is indeed capable of conveying specific emotional states without performance expression; and secondly that, nonetheless, if performers were allowed to play the same score in very different ways, listeners would find that score taking on very different meanings.",

Leibowitz’s and Stadlen’s recordings show how differently Webern’s music must have sounded when young, how much more in keeping with the emotional writer recently contextualized by Brown ( 2011 ). Since the early “avant-garde” recordings of Craft and Boulez the sound of Webern has changed again, not least in their own re-recordings ( Quick 2010 , esp. pp. 75–82). Who is Webern?",

In his online study of Grieg’s playing, which accompanies his re-creation and extension of Grieg’s recordings on CD, (14) Sigurd Slåttebrekk (with Tony Harrison, 2011 ) discusses and illustrates instances in which the notorious four-squareness of Grieg’s paper musical structures dissolves in Grieg’s performances, revealing Grieg as a musician for whom ambiguity and asymmetry were aesthetic priorities. (15) Clearly his compositions have not been correctly understood using modern assumptions about how notes become sound. In these cases analytical facts derived from the score’s patterning are not facts about the music: the music exists in our response to what Grieg played, and our response is probably (given our period- and educational-subservience to score patterning) a lot more patterned than Grieg’s was. So even here, with the sounds surviving, Grieg’s solution is still only partially available to us. The whole Slåttebrekk/Harrison website, with its detailed analyses of Grieg’s playing and numerous sound examples, as well as the CD it supports, is highly interesting and revealing on this whole set of questions.",

And W. R. Anderson in The Gramophone used the same adjective in his review (February of the same year): It is shapely, well-knit music, conservative in idiom, expressive, dignified . . .

Nicholas Cook ( 2011 ) has recently shown how Eugen d’Albert’s playing, particularly admired by Schenker (of which more in a moment), privileged the unexpected over the structural; indeed, almost all the earliest recorded musicians privileged irregularity in ways that we would condemn in a modern performer as willful, mannered, and self-indulgent, even though, as for example in the case of Alfred Cortot, their thinking about performance might be rooted in an insistent concern for the composer’s context and intentions ( Thieffry 1937 , 16–20).

While it recognizes that performance practices changed, and that music sounded and felt different in the past, its solution is to get back to it and tie it permanently to the score, in other words to outlaw change in interpretation and meaning. If anything is clear from the recent history of recorded performance it is that HIP has changed a great deal, and does not know what it thinks it knows about earlier performance styles. Or if it does, then somehow, and without anyone commenting on it at the time, performance style underwent a revolution somewhere between Robert Schumann (whom HIP thinks it can now deal with, moving coherently on from its Classicized Beethoven) and the pupils of Clara Schumann (whom we know from records and who sound inconceivably different). In any case, contrary to the claim that pieces work best in their “original” performance style (the truth of which we can test only by listening to recordings of twentieth-century scores), recordings show us that they work in an amazing range of performance styles, which again strongly suggests that their notes limit the possible meanings far less than we have supposed.",

Much has already been written on what follows for theorists (both music- and critical-) from taking performance seriously ( Cook 2001a , 2001b , and 2003 ). An important strand in my argument here is that the extent of performance style change, startlingly obvious when one takes the evidence of recordings seriously, raises major questions about what theory theorizes. To put it very simply, what a piece of music is and what it means depend on when and where it is made by performers and experienced by listeners (as Dusman 1994 , 131, began to suggest). Performance, then, is not simply a reproduction, a performance of something, but a process , experienced in a particular cultural context, created by performers (using the notation) and mentally constructed (uniquely and temporarily) by each listener. Meaning is generated from moment to moment during performances, and traces of meaning remain in the memory of the listener (or score reader), inflecting their sense of the nature of the piece. The piece (which as a term may, in its insubstantiality, be preferable to the over-concrete “work”) is imagined as being represented in the score but, insofar as it exists at all, is in fact constructed by thinking about what might lie behind remembered or (currently) conceivable performances. The piece, in a further delusion, gets mapped onto the composition, the musical conception that was composed, to which in fact we have no access but which we can best think of as the (or a) performance imagined by the composer. In this typology it is the piece that is the subject of analytical and critical study, the composition that is the focus of historical musicology. The whole process is modulated at each and every step by that step’s own period performance style.",

In other words, the lessons of performance style change are highly pertinent to music theory ( Cook 2007 , 307). Likewise, the failure of HIP to arrive at historically correct performances once recorded evidence becomes available (witness Norrington’s Elgar, and (again) the pupils of Clara Schumann) only underlines the futility of supposing that HIT could arrive at anything like a historically correct reading of a theory text. (20) But it may be premature to rule out the possibility of fruitful studies of the relationship between performance and theory at particular places and times: we may not know what they meant, but if these two modes of musicking are related (as seems possible, perhaps probable) there might be links to be found even in our misunderstandings of them.

Both men were formalists in theory, yet in practice both strongly preferred the old rhetorical, vitalist style of performance, a style evolved to respond to content rather than form. It may be that neither was able to reconcile these conflicting views and neither was able to construct a coherent book as a consequence.

It is only when thinking more deeply about what drives one’s theory and one’s experience that the situation becomes problematic. For Schenker that larger difficulty may have lain in reconciling his personal tastes in performance style, which focused on local features above all, with his analytical emphasis on long-term structure: only one of these attitudes could continue his notion of the true tradition.

This only emphasizes the extent to which musical response operates locally, as the oldest performers a century ago assumed.

( 1996 —also Cross et al. 1996 ) have shown how listeners presented with eight segments of a sixteen-measure piece are relatively successful at correctly ordering segments into pairs (musicians more so than non-musicians) but much less successful at ordering pairs back into the original composition (in fact only one participant succeeded and he thought he had failed).",

All this indicates what in all honesty we know very well, that music is controlled and perceived from moment to moment: long-term structures are theoretical, useful for composers, an invitation from analysts to imagine music in a particular way, but apparently not perceptible (save in the vaguest outline via memory).

Rather, musical communication is effected between performer and listener at the level of the musical surface as it changes in sound and character from moment to moment. How that communication works, how character is represented in or suggested by sound, what performers do with notes to generate meaning, are the most pertinent questions for those who wish to understand music.

Figure 3 aims in this respect to improve on Figures 1 and 2. The composer, as both input to and output from an optional process of formal construction, imagines sounding music, and notates as much of it as s/he thinks necessary, given the performances s/he expects (i.e., given current performance style). For all but living composers that is the end of their involvement. The notation, to composers, means the sounds they imagined, but not to anyone else. Given performers contemporary with the composer and local to them (especially given performers they know) there is a fair chance that the sounds emerging from a performance will be physically like those imagined, and that their meaning will be perceived in a somewhat similar way by listeners. But for most Western music that is not the case. When a performer picks up the notation s/he is essentially starting from scratch, with no aural knowledge of performances contemporary with the composer, and with a radically different set of assumptions about what is musical (determined by their very different performance-stylistic education and more general communicative context, their culture indeed). What emerges from those notes is very different from what might have emerged early on in the life of the score.",

Although, as I have said, elderly musicians would have become aware of recent change, no one, until recordings began to accumulate, could have known how much performance style changes or that the process is (or so far appears to be) unceasing. (26) Once that became evident new music was anyway being recorded, providing for the first time reasonably clear evidence of how the scores were originally expected to sound. Not that the problem disappears: there is still no sign that anyone wants to hear Wagner as he was sung and played in the earliest recordings. But before the music of the late nineteenth century there is no adequate evidence of performance style to follow or to reject, nothing, in fact, to contradict our own period assumptions.",

Looking now at the other side of Figure 3’s double lines, across which only notation and inadequate words may pass, we find performers making what they can of that information, and doing it necessarily in a way that makes sense to their contemporaries. The Lethe river represented by those vertical lines is not otherwise passable. To imagine it can be bridged is wishful thinking. If ever, for a moment, the sounds made on both sides correspond, there is no way of knowing that they do.",

The agency is in fact the listener’s or the analyst’s in response to the performer’s responding to the notation determined by editors making their own sense of whatever was left by the composer or the nearest surviving sources. The chain is far too fragile to justify for any actor within it a solo role in determining musical character or intention; (27) and too fragile, therefore, to support a work concept anywhere along its length beyond the composer’s mind. The notion that a composer has left us something (some thing) that includes within it a particular network of interrelations generating (given an ideal commentator) definable meaning, irrespective of the sounds performers may make or of changes in the mentality of performers and listeners, is not sustainable.
