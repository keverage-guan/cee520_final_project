    "abstract": "In his historically momentous account of tuning, Marchetto of Padua (fl. 1305–19) proposed dividing the whole tone of received theory (9/8=204 cents) into 5 parts. This report develops determinate arithmetic and geometric realizations of Marchetto’s formulation—directly applicable to the medieval monochord, and sonically illustrated by digital files. The resulting intervals’ feasibility is compared with current findings in the psychology of interval perception. Conjectures are offered as to how and to whom Marchetto’s tuning was taught. A dual formulation of “nuanced,” heterogenous tonal systems is advanced to assess structural effects of Marchetto’s tuning on pieces and to suggest ways one could learn to perceive and sing his intervals nowadays.",

Briefly, Marchetto’s account favours 2 main\nreadings of his whole-tone division: into 9 or 5 parts.\nFrom |Luc. \n2.5.15| onward, Marchetto writes uniformly\nof 5 dieses per whole tone. (1) However, to regard the\nwhole tone as divided into 5 parts tout court is to\ndiscount Marchetto’s extended preliminary account of\nhow “the nature of the whole tone, its essence, would\nconsist in the 9-fold number compared to the 8-fold\nnumber [i.e., the ratio 9/8]” (quod natura toni et\nessentia eius consistat in novenario numero ad octonarium\ncomparato: |Luc. \n2.4.1–42| ) and “in the perfection\nof the 9-fold number” (in perfectione numeri\nnovenarii: |Luc. \n2.5.8| ), as well as his theses that: a) “the 9-fold number [i.e., as such, in contrast to,\ne.g., 9 * 2 = 18 or 3 * 3 = 9] can never be divided into equal\nparts” (novenarius numerus numquam potest dividi in\npartes equales: |Luc. \n2.5.9| ); b) “its parts must be unequal” (partes ipsius debeant\nesse inequales: |Luc. \n2.5.13| ); c) “1 would be its 1st part; from 1 to 3, its 2d\n[part]; from 3 to 5, its 3d [part]; from 5 to 7, its\n4th [part]; from 7 to 9, its 5th [part]; and such a 5th\npart is the 5th odd number of the 9-fold totality”\n(unus sit prima pars; de uno ad tres, secunda; de\ntribus ad quinque, tertia; de quinque ad septem,\nquarta; de septem ad novem, quinta; et talis quinta\npars est quintus numerus impar totius novenarii: |Luc. \n2.5.14| )—in other words, that Marchetto construes\nthe 5 unequal parts of the whole tone as comprising\n1 + ( 4 * 2 ) 9th-parts, a point clarified by his having\nemphasized that the 9-fold number can never be divided\ninto equal parts, because: d) “a unit is in it that resists being divided” (est . . . ibi unitas que resistit dividi: |Luc. \n2.5.10| ), an\nidea Herlinger astutely connects with Marchetto’s\nlater, more complete statement of Remigius s doctrine\nthat: e) “an even number is mutable and divisible [i.e., into\nequal segments], whereas an odd number is indivisible,\ncontaining a unit in its middle that resists division”\n(numerus par mutabilis et divisibilis est; numerus vero\nimpar indivisibilis est continens unitatem in medio sui que divisioni resistit: |Luc. 6.3.14| : [my emphasis]).",

Either of 2 propositions from Euclid\n     would suffice—even to realize alternative\n     Renaissance versions of Marchetto’s tuning.[2;6] b): i) Visually, the marks for Marchetto’s truly novel\n     intervals (involving F74, C74, G74, D74) would be\n     quite distinct from those of previous tunings. The\n     intervals in his tuning that involved B or Bb\n     were alternatives to, substitutes for, or re-“ratio”-nalizations of, intervals in previous\n     medieval tuning. These novelties would be hard to\n     distinguish by eye from those they would have\n     replaced, especially in upper registers.[3.0–8] ii) Sonically, the medieval monochord would be much\n     more accurate than its post-1500 successor. All\n     the same, any sources of measurement error would\n     help persuade listeners of Marchetto’s time that\n     differences between his enharmonic/diatonic\n     semitones and their earlier, Pythagorean versions\n     were negligible.[3.9–10] c) Melodically or in discant, musicians would have\n     little difficulty distinguishing aurally intervals\n     produced by Marchetto’s novel F74, C74, G74, and \n     D74 from  intervals of previous medieval practice.\n     Conversely, Marchetto’s substitutes for standard\n     Pythagorean notes (B, Bb) generally would pass\n     unnoticed.[4] d) Marchetto’s musical examples would serve not only as\n     an excellent lab demonstration for theorists but\n     also as a superb, step-by-step curriculum for\n     novice singers. His schematic fragments easily\n     could be memorized as exercises and used as a\n     basis for group- or self-instruction.[5] e) Even if simplistically realized (e.g., as “1/5-tones”), characteristically Marchettan pitch-structures would survive—as they would if the\n     most important mathematical flaw in Marchetto’s\n     formulation were removed in a straightforward\n     manner [3.6–7;6] f) Even if Marchetto’s intervals were performed in\n     Pythagorean, equally-tempered, etc. versions,\n     Marchettan structures would persist—albeit to\n     varying degrees—in pieces closest in provenance\n     to his original formulation. Each such version can\n     be understood in its own right—or in fully “de-centred” fashion, as a variant of the others. In\n     principle, fluency in each could be acquired by\n     refining or “de-refining” skills learned for any\n     of the others.[7] 2. GEOMETRIC CONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MONOCHORD",
