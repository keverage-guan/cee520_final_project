    "abstract": "The use of the harmonic series as a pitch-generating resource is a significant trend in twentieth- and twenty-first-century composition. While the principle of equal temperament prioritizes an additive understanding of intervals, the harmonic series implies a ratio-based approach to pitch relationships. Despite these philosophical differences and the sometimes polemical debates that have attended to them, the works of Julian Anderson (1967–) and Rand Steiger (1957–) draw simultaneously on overtone-based and equal-tempered harmonic thinking. These two composers are part of a group of musicians who have proposed various hybrid approaches to harmonic construction, and their works are also notable for playing out interactions between these influences in ways that reflect the composers’ political concerns. In this paper, I combine examinations of Anderson’s and Steiger’s characteristic harmonic strategies with close analyses of two quartertone-based works: Anderson’sEden(2005) and Steiger’sPost-truth Lament(2017). I use these discussions to consider the pieces’ diverse political resonances. Ultimately, I argue that their hybrid harmonic approaches serve to highlight the multifaceted implications of ambiguity—not only its musically generative potential, but also its capacity to transform contemporary political life in ways both corrosive and constructive.",

For instance, in a 1/1 editorial addressed to his fellow JI-interested colleagues, Larry Polansky warns that there is a difference between “inclusionary fanaticism, or composition, and preclusionary fanaticism, or cultism” and argues that JI “must be viewed as one experiment in many to evolve the musical mind, and not as a socio-political musical act” ( Polansky 1985 , 2). Writing over thirty years later, Polansky again cautions against exclusionary and moralistic critiques of ET, noting that “even the oft-maligned” 12-TET has produced “an enormous and incredibly varied amount of music” and that “given its legacy, it’s hard to, in good faith, call [12-TET] a limitation” ( Polansky 2018 ). The musicologist Bob Gilmore, meanwhile, speculates that Johnston’s proposals may not have caught on more widely due to feared resemblances to religious or political dogmas ( Gilmore 2017 , 101–2).",

These various methods of using ET to approximate the tunings of overtones are arguably supported by Tenney’s notion of “tolerance,” which holds that the human auditory system accepts intervals that are not perfectly justly tuned as stand-ins for just-tuned ones, assuming that the deviation in tuning is sufficiently small ( Tenney 1983 , 22). As Robert Hasegawa has shown, Tenney’s hypothesis can be understood as an extension of the “tone representation” ( Tonvorstellung ) theories of Hugo Riemann ( Hasegawa 2006 ); so, too, does the tolerance concept resonate with the writings of Henry Cowell, who suggests that tempered chords could be analyzed as  “approximations” of the harmonic series ( [1930] 1996 , 21). In correspondence with Bob Gilmore, Johnston expressed skepticism toward the notion of tolerance, saying that “the symbolism of the aim to be perfectly, mathematically accurate in terms of proportionality is more important than the obvious fact that human frailty prevents any performance from attaining to it. I believe that even one’s notation, even one’s performance practices should symbolize what one is trying to communicate” ( Gilmore 1995 , 502).",

In many of Anderson’s works, including Eden , he calls for one or more instruments to be tuned an equal-tempered quartertone lower than the rest of the ensemble before the start of the piece. These retuned instruments can then perform quartertone approximations of a given series’ 7th, 11th, and 13th partials with relative ease, including at fast tempi. However, Anderson sometimes also realizes these partials using natural harmonics on various instruments, such as horns. Anderson says that he generally regards the discrepancies arising between a quartertone-approximated partial on a retuned instrument and a natural-harmonic version of the same partial on another instrument to be negligible in the musical contexts within which he works. He notes, for example, a horn’s natural 7th partial can sound relative to 12-TET closer to a quartertone flat than an idealized harmonic series would suggest (Julian Anderson, interview via Zoom, June 2, 2021).",

Although Anderson connects Brancusi’s visual impetus to the piece’s frequent practice of hocketing a single melodic line between different instruments ( Anderson 2005 ), I suggest that overtonal and ET-based modes of thought are, in Eden , also not unlike the simultaneously distinct yet conjoined lovers of Brancusi’s sculpture.",

Though this essay is principally concerned with the domain of harmony, the ways in which the passage shown in Example 5 plays with boundaries between monophony and polyphony arguably constitute another type of ambiguity in Eden . Example 5 suggests that the fragment shown is polyphonic from m. 48.2, though to my ears, mm. 48.2–49 could in fact be heard “both ways”—i.e., as a single line or as two separate lines. (Starting in m. 50, however, there is for this listener an unmistakable sensation of polyphony.) Similarly, I have represented mm. 57– 58.1 as consisting of a single line, though I think a reasonable argument could also be made for multiple lines here. In an interview, Anderson said that he was aware of these questions when he was composing the piece, explaining that he took inspiration from psychoacoustic research on the phenomenon of streaming (Julian Anderson, interview via Zoom, June 2, 2021).

Here, the fundamentals modulate down a major 3rd in pitch-class space, from C to A ♭ . Accordingly, the same types of common tones appear, but in reversed order: the starting fundamental, C, becomes the 5th partial of the ending fundamental, A ♭ , with F(+¼) or G ♭ (-¼) functioning as both the 11th partial of the former and the 7th partial of the latter.",

However, rather than simply fading away like the other partials, the pitch is re-articulated with an accent, thereby gently asserting its independence from the rest of the overtonal sonority and, due to being cast against the viola’s 12-TET melody, highlighting the foreign and uncanny side of its non-12-TET identity. Thus, as Eden comes to a conclusion, there seems to be little in the way of a clear answer on whether ET structures enhance or stand in counterpoint to perceptions of overtonality: indeed, within the final three measures alone, both options seem to hold true.",

For that reason, one might object that it is arbitrary to regard such a pitch as being representative of one 12-TET pitch class rather than another. This issue does not arise in many of Steiger’s other works, where he uses cent-specific tunings and where the intonation of a microtonally-altered pitch will therefore almost always be closer to one 12-TET pitch than another. Given how important these ideas have been to Steiger in his compositional process across several decades, I propose referring to them as a potentially useful lens through which we might grapple with some passages of Post-truth Lament , even while acknowledging that they might lose a certain degree of meaning when applied to the particular instrumental resources of this work.",

Both Anderson and Steiger draw on the harmonic series as a resource for generating pitch materials, yet their works also show significant influence from other conceptions of pitch rooted in equal temperament. At first glance, these compositional interests might seem to exist in a state of uneasy tension. The harmonic series, which underlies many pitched instruments’ basic acoustical properties, is a theoretically infinite collection of frequencies (overtones or partials) that are whole-number multiples of some base frequency (fundamental). By contrast, equal temperament (ET) understands pitches to be related not by integer frequency ratios but instead by an additive grid of distance intervals. Twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET), a type of ET that divides the distance between pitches whose frequencies are in a 2:1 ratio (i.e., an octave) into twelve equal steps, has been a particularly dominant pitch-organizing force in Western music-making for several centuries. I suggest that in Anderson’s and Steiger’s works, these different conceptual structures interact in musically generative and politically suggestive ways.",

More recent harmonic series-interested composers, including Anderson and Steiger, have also worked with higher partials of the series beyond those arguably utilized in historical tonal styles. Picking up on the variety of musical results toward which the series can seemingly be put, Daniel Harrison defines the term “overtonality” as a property of “any tonal hierarchy that relies on spectral overlap for its stability conditions” and thus “freely imitates the tonal hierarchy modeled in the overtone series” ( Harrison 2016 , 17). For Harrison, however, works that focus on upper overtones of the series sometimes lead to complex relationships between overtonality as a compositional device and overtonality in perceptual reality; at times, Harrison says, the listener might be able to experience representations of high partials as elements within a palpable hierarchy centered on some fundamental frequency, while at others it might be far more challenging to perceive such a relationship. (1) Much of this article is concerned with the fluctuating degrees to which Anderson’s and Steiger’s harmonic languages invite “overtonal” hearings—whether, to what extent, and in what ways we might perceive these composers’ pitch choices in relation to a harmonic series-based framework.",

                "text": "[5] Pushed to its furthest logical extent, overtonal thinking leads to a subset within the broader field of just intonation (JI), which holds that pitches should be tuned precisely in accordance with whole-number frequency ratios. Many recent JI advocates have explored ratios involving prime numbers higher than those useful for tuning earlier tonal repertoires in order to generate novel pitch resources. Building on work by Harry Partch, the composer and theorist Ben Johnston refers to this expansion of the useable ratio palette as “extended just intonation” ( [2003] 2006 ). Johnston invokes matters of listener perception and comprehensibility to explain his interest in relating pitches by ratios rather than tempered distance intervals: Interval-scale thinking emphasizes symmetry of design. The harmonic and tonal meaning of symmetrical pitch structures is ambiguity . Chordally they produce either a sense of multiple root possibilities or of no satisfactory root possibility. Tonally they cause either a sense of several possible tonics or of no adequate tonic. Ratio-scale thinking, on the contrary, emphasizes a hierarchical subordination of details to the whole or to common reference points. The harmonic and tonal meaning of proportional pitch structures is clarity and a sense of direction. ( Johnston 1964 , 74; italics original) Johnston thus seems focused on the “senses” that these opposing methods of pitch organization might arouse: while two pitches related by integer frequency ratios share a “common reference point”—i.e., a governing fundamental frequency—and thus engender “clarity,” pitches separated by a tempered interval do not have this property and therefore promote “ambiguity.” Johnston also brought these ideas into his own compositions; he designed an elaborate notation system in which every pitch’s meaning is fixed according to a particular ratio-based derivation and sought to establish a performance practice for achieving such just-tuned intervals in acoustical reality.",

                "text": "[6] Johnston set forth these proposals in the mid-1960s, when totalizing ideologies of harmony frequently characterized the musical discourse around him. In particular, methods of constructing atonal harmonic languages via 12-TET pitch-class serialization wielded considerable influence, especially in the United States.  As Anne Shreffler notes, American discussions around serial techniques were shaped early on by the ideological zeal of post-Schoenberg European writers such as René Leibowitz, and their increasing adoption was then widely inflected with the language of objective scientific progress and academic prestige ( Shreffler 2000 ). In a 1963 article, meanwhile, Charles Wuorinen attempts to position dodecaphony as an unquestioned lingua franca for composers of his generation—one “so familiar that there is today hardly a conscious decision on their part in employing it” ( Wuorinen 1963 , 57). As Wuorinen himself acknowledges, this attitude toward composition assumes the 12-TET conception of pitch class to be axiomatic ( Wuorinen 1979 , 5). (2) Around this time, other leading composers and theorists associated with atonal pitch-class-based techniques, such as Milton Babbitt ( [1965] 1972 ) and Allen Forte ( 1955 ), also broke with earlier generations of writers and launched broad challenges to the harmonic series’ relevance in music-making. For these reasons, composers whose interest in overtone-based relationships led them to conceive of pitches between the cracks of the modern Western keyboard felt excluded from the mainstream discourse; Joel Mandelbaum, for instance, gave a talk at the 1967 meeting of the American Society of University Composers entitled “The Isolation of the Microtonal Composer” ( Mandelbaum 1967 ). Mandelbaum argues that, despite the rich theoretical promise of working beyond the boundaries of 12-TET, the then-mainstream avant-garde outlook had all but dismissed microtonal composition as a mere historical curiosity.",

For instance, Partch describes the piano keyboard’s octave divisions as “twelve black and white bars in front of musical freedom” ( Partch 1991 , 12), and Johnston speaks in two essays of his desire to “purify” Western music of the “adulterations” introduced by temperament ( Johnston [2003] 2006 , 63; 1987 , 519) and calls ET an “acoustical lie” ( Johnston [2003] 2006 , 62). The inaugural issue of the JI journal 1/1 features an article in which its founding editor, David B. Doty, mirrors Wuorninen’s rhetorical strategy and claims that “the simple-ratio intervals of Just Intonation are the only musically meaningful entities from which melody or harmony are to be constructed” ( Doty 1985 , 15). Running throughout these comments is an apparent feeling that the gradual encroachment of ET-based thinking into Western music—one which, in Johnston’s telling, began with the fourteenth-century’s notational response to a burgeoning use of thirds and sixths as consonances and intensified with the widespread adoption of temperaments for keyboard instruments in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ( Johnston [2003] 2006 , 65)—has amounted to something of a slow-motion, centuries-long fall from grace. Indeed, surveying the language used by several generations of JI-oriented writers, Marc Perlman identifies a tendency to equate the practice of just intonation with “nature” and equal temperament with the “corruptions of civilization” ( Perlman 1994 , 516).

Hybrid compositional strategies that allow overtonality to enter into dialogue with equal-tempered pitch structures can take at least two forms. The first form simply involves using equal-tempered grids to realize musical ideas that are derived from overtones or related acoustical phenomena. This is a notion with longstanding precedence. For instance, Ivan Wyschnegradsky’s Manual of Quarter-Tone Harmony , though primarily focused on deriving microtonal pitch resources from symmetrical distance intervals rather than frequency ratios, includes a discussion of how equal-tempered quartertones (24-TET) can be used to approximate a range of overtones, particularly the 11th partial and its octave transpositions ( Wyschnegradsky [1932] 2017 , 27–28). More recently, Ezra Sims has suggested dividing the octave into seventy-two equal parts (72-TET) as a means of even more accurately representing the harmonic series ( Sims 1988 ); this tuning system appears not only in Sims’ music but also in works by James Tenney ( Changes , 1985), Hans Zender ( Bardo , 2000), and Georg Friedrich Haas ( limited approximations , 2010), among others. Several strategies of dividing of the octave into numbers of pitches that are not multiples of twelve, such as nineteen ( Yasser 1932 ) and thirty-one ( Fokker 1955 ), have also been proposed on similar acoustical grounds. In other cases still, a composer might use none other than 12-TET itself as a grid for realizing overtonal harmonies, as in several of Unsuk Chin’s piano etudes ( In C , 2003; Toccata , 2003) as well as certain early twentieth-century works, such as the piano preludes of Claude Debussy. (4) Lastly, many works of French spectralism, including those by Gérard Grisey and Tristan Murail, round the tunings of overtone harmonies and other frequency-based pitch structures to several of these equal-tempered grids, including 12-TET, 24-TET, and others.

One could include in this category works such as Magnus Lindberg’s Joy (1990), which invites the listener to hear 12-TET pitch sets both as isolated, atonal entities and as subsets of larger overtonal harmonies; Haas’ in vain (2000), which creates aurally frictious sonorities by transposing various just-tuned harmonic series through a 12-TET grid; György Ligeti’s Hamburg Concerto (2003), which similarly manipulates the harmonic series of natural horns; and Chin’s Double Concerto (2002) and Rocanā (2008), in which overtone-based chords interact with more atonal-sounding and often noise-colored materials. Beyond the boundaries of traditionally notated concert music, Pauline Oliveros explored a related interest in creating dialogues between different conceptions of pitch through the performing group The Space Between, which combined Oliveros’s custom just-tuned accordion with a shakuhachi and a 12-TET piano ( Oteri 2000 ).

In fact, everything I compose is anti-fundamentalist, and the regrowth of fundamentalism that we’ve seen in so many areas of life in the past thirty-five years is frankly repugnant to me. There’s no doubt that new music, too, has its fundamentalists: people who believe that all problems in composition can be solved by subscribing blindly to a single overriding aesthetic, for life. Such people admit no contradictions and are perhaps the greatest single danger to creativity (some of them teach composition, alas). Clearly, some people are very frightened by danger and ambiguity. I grew up in the 1980s, and the hideous political climate of that time—social and sexual intolerance, dogma against dogma, while society went to the bad—gave me a permanent allergy to all extremism and really left me wondering what to expect from politics. ( Palmer 2015 , 12) Given his identity as an out gay man and decades-long involvement in LGBTQIA+ activism ( Anderson 2020 ), Anderson’s stance of revulsion toward the intolerant climate of the eighties is surely one that is deeply and personally felt. Anderson also carries this position into an equally strong rejection of fundamentalism in the musical sphere, and it is notable how freely he seems to drift between music and politics in the comment above: these two spaces are, for him, evidently isomorphic and deeply interrelated.

In an email to the author, Anderson summarized his harmonic strategies as the result of an intricate dance between the inherent acoustical properties of instruments and culturally evolved tuning systems: In any music, two contradictory factors are at play: 1) the tuning of pitch; this may well be but (as we know from many different cultures) does not necessarily have to be related to the lower partials of the harmonic series . . . . Either way, in most cultures the question of tuning, whether extrapolated from resonance spectra or not, is usually expressed as a viable practical system which has to be playable at any speed in any register. This involves solving certain problems, and equal temperament solves them one way, whilst other systems solve them differently. But it is almost unheard of for a musical culture not to have any tuning system for its pitches. I never heard of one that didn’t. Once evolved, such systems take on a life of their own. 2) The other factor is sound itself, and here we enter the realm of resonances pure and simple, regardless of tuning considerations. It is obvious that resonances are simply a property of the materials being used to make instruments, plus the shaping and treatment of those materials to construct the instruments concerned, and the manner in which they are played . . . . These resonance considerations may well—and usually do—contradict any tuning system human cultures set up. These two factors seem to me to be central and in constant, if often unconscious, changing dialogue with each other . . . . Any composer is taking a decision as to where they or their music stands in relation to the above issues, however unconsciously. And my music expresses my varying positions on these matters, sometimes . . . very explicitly. (Julian Anderson, email to the author, August 19, 2020) Anderson is commenting here on a state of affairs that some JI proponents lament in their writings: that tuning systems such as 12-TET, once introduced, take on “a life of their own” and become culturally ossified. But for Anderson, this is not necessarily problematic; to the contrary, he seems to feel that it makes for a dialogue between different pitch structures ripe with opportunities for musical exploration. Anderson appears unbothered by the fact that such a rich network of influences might come to bear on one’s work, even if those influences are in conflict with one another. Even more notably, he acknowledges unapologetically that his own viewpoints on their interactions are multiple in nature and subject to change.",

(9) Generally speaking, Anderson draws only from the set of 12-TET pitches to determine the fundamental for a given harmonic series, and within a series he focuses on partials no higher than the 13th, with octave transpositions of the first thirteen partials also allowed ( Anderson and Dingle 2020 , 422). Given these constraints, Anderson rounds a series’ 7th, 11th, and 13th partials to 12-TET pitches altered by equal-tempered quartertones, while the remaining partials are represented as unmodified 12-TET pitches ( Anderson 2019 ). Anderson’s system thus takes as a starting point the first type of hybridity between overtonal and ET-based thinking introduced above—i.e., the incorporation of pitch relationships inspired by overtones into an equal-tempered (in this case quartertone-based) landscape.

Example 2, meanwhile, realizes these same partials in a manner consistent with the macrotonal system, with all partials rounded to the nearest equal-tempered quartertone (50 cents). Note the varying degrees of tuning discrepancy that exist between the two versions. For instance, the quartertone-rounded 11th partial of Example 2 is within just one cent of its counterpart in Example 1.

The title of the work is highly suggestive, conjuring images of an undefiled, paradisal terrain with which just-tuned sonorities have so often been associated. In its deployment of the macrotonal framework, however, Eden declines to stage the specific type of return to innocence—a full embrace of just intervals and an equally strong rejection of ET—that JI proponents have urged. Alternatively, picking up on a question posed of the work by Arnold Whittall, one might wonder if Eden attempts to portray through its mixing of overtonal and equal-tempered principles a fall from grace, a departure from purely just-tuned innocence instead of a reclaiming of it: “can Eden,” Whittall asks, “possibly have a happy ending?” ( Whittall 2015 , 15).",

Musics in Eden , as we will see, become locked in a teasing, intimate dance, constantly fusing and splitting, converging and diverging. In so doing, they give rise to the second type of hybridity—the overt musical reference to interactions between overtonal and equal-tempered musical constructs—discussed in the introduction to this essay.

Finally, a climactic passage gives way to a slow coda in which the viola and cello soli are again revisited. Example 3 shows the work’s opening passage. (12) The string soloists are asked to play slightly sul ponticello and without vibrato; according to Anderson, these playing techniques are intended to transform the standard timbres of these modern orchestral instruments into ones more reminiscent of Renaissance viols (Julian Anderson, interview via Zoom, June 2, 2021). Note also that Anderson’s pitch language in mm. 1–10 is confined entirely to a white-note diatonic set; this, too, seems as if it might evoke an imaginary, centuries-old, pre-chromatic music. Furthermore, and as if to drive these layered semiotic conjurings even further home, the solo lines are given an expressive marking of “innocente” (innocent), and the score’s tempo specification of half note = 66 comes with the instruction “come una musica virginale” (“like a virginal music”).

An analyst familiar with Anderson’s praxis might recognize this as a telltale sign of the macrotonal system’s influence and conclude that this music was likely written with some harmonic series in mind. To hear this move to 24-TET through an overtonal lens in the moment, however, is a wholly different matter. To this listener’s ears, the totality of pitches heard up to this point do not cohere into an obvious overtonal picture; to the contrary, the F(+¼) feels jarring and disruptive relative to the exclusively 12-TET music that precedes it. I suspect my perception of rupture here is informed by the fact that the F(+¼) is approached from below by a D, forming what Wyschnegradsky terms a “neutral 3rd”—i.e., a minor 3rd widened by a quartertone or, conceived differently, a major 3rd narrowed by a quartertone ( Wyschnegradsky [1932] 2017 , 2). Absent any additional clarifying harmonic information, as is the case here, I tend to find it challenging to perceive pitches separated by this interval within some broader overtonal context. Indeed, Anderson appears to feel the same: he typically avoids melodic instances of the neutral 3rd ( Anderson and Dingle 2020 , 422) because he feels that it tends to present as a distracting “out-of-tune” version of nearby 12-TET intervals ( Anderson 2019 ). It is striking, then, that he selects this as the interval by which to approach Eden ’s first quartertone-altered pitch; within the context of Anderson’s harmonic idiolect, it seems to maximize the extent to which we might perceive it as a stark outsider to the preceding, more culturally familiar 12-TET set.

Beginning in m. 14, 12-TET and quartertone-altered pitches intermingle in every measure of Example 3, with the neutral 3rd also notably being replaced by a proliferation of stepwise intervals; in m. 17, another non-12-TET pitch class, B ♭ (-¼), is also added to the viola and cello’s pitch repertoire. Given Anderson’s pitch choices starting in m. 14, I begin to hear this music overtonally: namely, I perceive the viola and cello to be sweeping melodically through partials of C. Under such an interpretation, and as the annotations on Example 3 show, the B ♭ (-¼) and F(+¼) instantiate a C series’ 7th and 11th partials, respectively, with neighboring 12-TET pitches representing other nearby partials. Eden ’s opening viola and cello soli thus rapidly move to characterize equal-tempered quartertones in strikingly different ways. Though the music at first seems to use 24-TET to stage a clash of paradigms—with white-note, 12-TET diatonicism on one side and a quartertone-altered outsider on the other—an alternative, overtonal purpose for these pitch resources then emerges.

In mm. 40–48.1, which are reduced and analyzed in Example 4 , F(+¼) is once again the focus of much of our attention, with its relationships to surrounding 12-TET pitches now negotiated along the axis of timbre. The example opens with a timbrally blended group of bassoons, horns, and harp articulating only a tetrachordal subset of the white-note 12-TET material first heard in mm. 1–10. This tetrachord, {C, D, E, G}, is boxed and labeled as X on Example 4 and will prove salient in much of the music that follows.

Yet, just as we saw in subsequent measures of Example 3, the boundaries between these seemingly competing identities start to blur almost as soon as they are staked out. In mm. 44–45, for instance, the harp temporarily leaves the bassoons and horns and instead joins the clarinet–keyboard group, which now articulates not only F(+¼) but also E within the X tetrachord. Such maneuvers render overtonal interpretations for the music increasingly plausible to the ear, and indeed, in the remainder of the music shown in Example 4, the two instrumental groups (now further enriched by flutes and a vibraphone) seem to unite in presenting both downward and upward melodic sweeps through various partials of a harmonic series on C.

(16) Example 6 summarizes these interactions by tracing the derivation of a hybrid mode whose pitch classes are formed by the union of X, T 7 X, and a macrotonal realization of a fragment from a C harmonic series.

Because Anderson rounds the tunings of partials to the nearest quartertone, the modes shown in Example 6 and Example 8 share two common tones, E and B ♭ (-¼). The transformational graph of Example 9 draws on work by Rings ( 2011 ) and Hasegawa ( 2015 ) to visualize relationships obtaining between these collections. The two columns of nodes in the graph represent the two overtonal collections used in the passage; I have identified each node by the lowest odd-number partial it could conceivably represent—its overtone class, as Hasegawa terms it—as well as by a pitch-class letter name. Similarly, transformations between nodes are described with a pair of intervals. The first, again following Hasegawa, is an overtone-class interval, or a ratio between 1/1 and 2/1 that captures the change in the overtone class being instantiated; the second is a more standard pitch-class interval, though with decimals added to account for possible microtonal deviations from 12-TET. Straight arrows highlight common tones: although E and B ♭ (-¼) instantiate different overtone classes in the two collections, they are tuned the same way in both, as reflected by the pitch-class intervals of 0.0. The figure’s curved arrow, meanwhile, describes the transformation obtaining between the overtonal collections’ fundamentals: while the bottom nodes of the two columns correspond to the same overtone class in their respective collections (hence the overtone-class interval of 1/1), they are separated by a major third in pitch-class space (hence the pitch-class interval of 4.0).

Example 11 reduces and analyzes mm. 80–106, a portion of Eden ’s central section in which the viol-like string soli return. Rather than conspicuously intruding upon several measures’ worth of entirely 12-TET music, as they did at the beginning of the piece, quartertones now feature prominently in the viola’s and cello’s pitch languages from the outset, yielding a series of overtly overtonal melodic sweeps spanning fundamentals of G, D, C, A ♭ , C ♯ , and A.

Several layers of accompanying chords, meanwhile, confirm the overtonal lenses through which we might hear these new melodies. Especially striking is the viola’s brief reprise in m. 93 of the same neutral 3rd, <D, F(+¼)>, that we first heard in mm. 10–11. In my hearing of Eden ’s opening section, that interval amounted to something of a chasm standing in the way of a unifying overtonal interpretation. Although its return in m. 93 causes my ears to prick up, my feelings of disorientation are considerably softened here by a C-based overtonal chord in the winds, harp, keyboard, and violins in m. 93.3: since this harmony appears just after the viola soloist plays <D, F(+¼)>, I immediately feel more invited to hear those melodic pitches as the 9th and 11th partials, respectively, of a C fundamental.",

The pitch classes of these three fundamentals, {C, D, G}, are subsets of X {C, D, E, G} introduced in Example 4; indeed, they are related by precisely the interval class, ic5, that the music of Example 4 repeatedly highlighted when presenting that tetrachord. Throughout Examples 4, 5, and 7, we saw how X and its transformations moved from impeding overtonality to coinciding with it on the surface of the music; with that process now complete, X’s characteristic interval classes here play a more structural role, providing the underlying fundamentals for a series of unambiguously overtonal lines and chords. After a sudden downward-major-3rd shift in fundamental, from C to A ♭ , in m. 95—a shift whose strategy closely recalls that of the upward -major-3rd modulation studied in Example 9 (18) —the music engages in another prolonged ic5 toggle between A ♭ and C ♯ fundamentals throughout mm. 96–102.

The sonic result of this apparent superimposition, however, is surprisingly clear and euphonious: to my ears, the bass sounds not only like a self-contained layer but also as if it provides a convincing harmonization for all of the music above it. Indeed, while the context of the preceding measures encourages us to understand the layers of Example 11 as macrotonal realizations of partials on several different fundamentals, closer examination reveals that most of the pitches heard throughout mm. 103–6 also align well with overtones—admittedly, in many cases, higher than those typically used in the macrotonal system—of the lowest pitch in the texture, A1. Similarly, the brief hocketing melody played by clarinets, vibraphone, and keyboard in mm. 103–5 could, as noted on Example 11, be interpreted as a juxtaposition of partials on all six fundamentals previously explored in this section, yet most of them also fit well within the same A1 spectrum. Example 12 compares the totality of pitches heard in mm. 103–6 against quartertone-approximated partials of A1, with correspondences between the collections circled.",

In this sense, we might think of the passage as an illustration of the harmonic series’ recursive nature—the fact, in other words, that within a given harmonic series there are embedded infinitely many more series, with the fundamental of each of these “child” series being a partial in the original “parent” series. Indeed, Anderson has identified this as among the harmonic series’ properties most salient in his compositional thinking ( Anderson 2019 ). Its instantiation on the surface of Eden is especially suggestive: by positing several musical layers as contextually distinct yet partially acoustically unified, it seems to encapsulate in one fleeting moment the dialectical nature of the work’s approach to harmonic construction.

Example 13 reduces the final nine measures of Eden ’s coda, which are especially instructive in this regard. The seven-note chord that begins the fragment has, compared to many of Eden ’s other harmonies, a strikingly opaque and inharmonic sound, and I similarly find it challenging to hear the almost brooding melody—initiated heterophonically by horns and violins then continued by the viola soloist from m. 179—as the sort of overtonal melodic sweep that Eden has gradually conditioned me to expect. (19) A stronger sense of overtonality is, however, reinstated in the music’s chordal layer from m. 176.4 until the end: as shown on Example 13, the fundamentals in this layer form a complete cycle of major 3rds, <C, E, A ♭ , C>, thus instantiating one last time the same common-tone modulatory technique first encountered in Example 9.

Whittall picks up on this concluding sonority to suggest that the piece ends with a sense of “hopeful but uncertain reaching-beyond, or else a regretful backward glance at something still imaginable, if not [sic] longer actually attainable” ( Whittall 2015 , 16). We might note here the possibility of analyzing the viola’s pitches as roughly approximated upper overtones of the chordal layer’s lowest pitch, C1, in a manner reminiscent of mm. 103–6: as Example 14 shows, two of the viola’s three pitches align with a C1 spectrum in this way. All overtones in question are higher than those typically used in Anderson’s system, however, and unlike mm. 103–6, the musical context provides no additional interpretation for the viola’s pitches falling within the normative bounds of macrotonality. This, plus the instrument’s timbral characteristics and melodic contour, lead me to perceive the viola independently from the instruments below, and a possible overtonal relationship to the C chord remains highly provisional to my ears.

Or are we hearing the soloist straining to participate in one last overtonal complex but, now deprived of its viol-like innocence, ultimately being forced to chart out a different path? One might well think here of feelings of nostalgia running through many twentieth-century modernist works. For Jonathan Cross, modernism is characterized in part by the “impossibility of a longed-for return to the past” ( Cross 2006 , 40); this quality, he argues, permeates music by composers from Schoenberg and Stravinsky ( Cross 2008 ) to Anderson’s elder compatriot Harrison Birtwistle ( Cross 2006 ). Perhaps we can hear the ending of Eden as joining this long tradition, with Anderson’s viola longing for an overtonality that has, before our ears, suddenly slipped from the present into the past. In the end, however, it is unclear whether the soloist’s divergences from the chord beneath it are in fact being lamented or if, on the contrary, they are meant to be celebrated.",

Perhaps most notably, Anderson excludes a number of 24-TET intervals from the surface of his music; of intervals smaller than the 12-TET semitone, for instance, he says that to his ears “they generally sound like slides, or fuzzy, soured, out of tune tempered intervals” (quoted in Small 2017 , 31), and for this reason he fully avoids composing with them. This decision is striking given that one can find such intervals within higher regions of the harmonic series, and it would thus seem to limit the extent to which Anderson’s music can engage with the sorts of ambiguities—the swings in 24-TET intervals’ status between sonorous, overtonality-engendering structures and disruptive, markedly non-12-TET outsiders—that I have explored in the above analysis.",

As Bruno Latour suggests, necessary and well-meaning attempts to “detect the real prejudices hidden behind the appearance of objective statements” may have unwittingly lent credence to those who would nefariously sow “excessive distrust of good matters of fact” and seek to “destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives” ( Latour 2004 , 227). Writing in 2004, Latour cites as an example of this trend the still-pervasive right-wing tendency to undermine scientific evidence for climate change ( Latour 2004 , 226); thinking even more recently, we might reflect on former President Donald Trump’s attempts to blur distinctions and create false equivalences between anti-racism activists and white supremacists. Does the political climate of the twenty-first century highlight how values of “healthy pluralism,” as Matthew D’Ancona puts it, can be perverted into “unhealthy relativism” ( D’Ancona 2017 , 84)?

Here, I consider how Steiger’s use of harmony in Post-truth Lament explores through sound the manifold interactions between truth and lies, justice and injustice, in the United States’ political environment at large. I argue that in the opening passages of the work, Steiger draws on the multiplicity of harmonic influences that have characterized his music for decades to illustrate troubling slippages between true facts and “alternative” ones. Later passages, on the other hand, gesture fleetingly and tentatively toward something of a reconciliation between different harmonic principles; by extension, they perhaps offer a vision—one which is simultaneously hopeful and remote—of a more just future. Like Anderson’s Eden , then, Steiger’s work features a range of interactions between different conceptions of harmony. I sense in Post-truth Lament ’s hybrid approaches a meditation on the fragile dialectics of our present political moment and a sense of uncertain, open-ended questioning of the ways they might be resolved.",

I suggest that these two streams of influence play vitally important roles in the harmonic language of Post-truth Lament . At the same time, this work is unusual in the context of the rest of Steiger’s catalogue by virtue of its instrumentation and the compositional strategies it does, and does not, enable. In many of his works, Steiger specifies that pitches should be tuned quite precisely relative to their harmonic series counterparts (in many cases to the nearest cent), enabling him to explore liminal perceptual spaces between chords and timbres that emerge when overtonal sonorities are very accurately tuned. In Post-truth Lament , however, Steiger has only two options for realizing a partial of a given harmonic series: namely, with a 12-TET pitch, available on the first piano, or with a 12-TET pitch flattened by one quartertone, available on the second piano. Atypically for Steiger, then, he uses a 24-TET grid similar to that of Anderson’s macrotonal system for realizing overtonal sonorities in the work.",

But although Steiger asserts that he was generally not interested in the two pianos sounding “out of tune” with one another, in an interview with the author he also observed that there are indeed passages in Post-truth Lament that seem to stray away from overtonal thinking. Such passages, he says, were intended as nods toward the feeling of harmonic “sourness” that seems to permeate some other quartertone piano repertoire (Rand Steiger, email to the author, May 4, 2020). In such scenarios, 24-TET is arguably treated less as a grid for realizing “in tune,” overtonal harmonies and more as an “out of tune” version of 12-TET containing additional, “wrong note”-feeling pitches. This creates a point of connection between Steiger’s harmonic devices and the sometimes ambiguous status of non-12-TET pitches in Anderson’s Eden : as we saw above, at times they might feel like outsiders to the more culturally familiar 12-TET set, while at others they can fuse with standard 12-TET pitches to create a single, harmonically unified overtonal complex.",

While some of Post-truth Lament ’s passages seem intended to realize overtonal harmonies as faithfully as possible, other passages contain sonorities that evoke the harmonic series to a more qualified degree, and others still indulge in sounds with little to no apparent resemblance to overtonal principles. Adding further still to the complexity, Steiger’s piece seems to invite us to notice how the same techniques associated with “injustice” at one moment might contribute to a sensation of relative “justice” at another. I suggest, then, that Post-truth Lament amounts to a multifaceted exploration of the intermediate states and rich interactions that can obtain between “just” (“in tune,” overtonal) and “unjust” (“out of tune,” non-overtonal) harmony when composing with equal-tempered quartertones.

Example 17 , meanwhile, analyzes the pitch content of m. 11 relative to the same E ♭ 1 harmonic series. Note that while the fundamental itself is not one of the pitches included in the polyrhythmic unfurling—a fact that could initially make ascertaining the “justness” of the pitch material somewhat challenging—the fundamental, along with several additional partials from the same series, is stated in m. 11.

Example 18 reproduces the score for m. 20, which is the piece’s first glimpse into this comparatively “unjust” harmonic world. Like m. 11, this new material is distinguished from the polyrhythmic unfurling it interrupts by virtue of its rhythm (rhythmic unison instead of polyrhythm) and register (relatively expansive use of the pianos’ range). But in contrast to our experience of m. 11, an overtonal manner in which we might hear this new material does not readily present itself. Here, the first piano articulates a pitch-class set { D ♭ , D, E ♭ , E, F, G, A, B ♭ }, with some pitch classes realized in multiple registers. Rather than situating this material within some sort of palpably overtonal context, however, the second piano simply doubles the first at an interval of a perfect 4th plus an additional quartertone. This interval, which Wyschnegradsky calls a “major 4th” ( Wyschnegradsky [1932] 2017 , 2), results in a quartertone-modified, doppelgänger-like version of the first piano’s pitch-class set: { A ♭ (-¼), A(-¼), B ♭ (-¼), B(-¼), C(-¼), D(-¼), E(-¼), F(-¼)}.",

In the context of an overtonal sonority, this 24-TET interval can be made to sound particularly “just,” for it very closely approximates the JI interval between the 8th and 11th partials of a given harmonic series. In symmetrical intervallic landscapes such as Wyschnegradsky’s, however, this same interval can take on a far more atonal, alien-sounding quality. To my ears, m. 20 of Post-truth Lament shows off this latter side of the Janus-faced major 4th. While this interval between the first and second pianos could have been derived through recourse to overtonal principles, its deployment on the musical surface challenges the listener’s ability to perceive it in a meaningfully overtonal way. Steiger thus disassociates a potentially “just” interval from a musical context that would reveal its overtonal origins, transforming it into a static and uncanny doubling. I suggest that this moment marks a swing from a “just” (“in tune”) to an “unjust” (“out of tune”) use of the 24-TET grid: rather than perceiving the contents of the measure overtonally, I hear two superimposed versions of a 12-TET set that are “othered” relative to one another due to the contextually unusual-sounding interval separating them. Referring back to the specific political context in which Steiger composed Post-truth Lament , we might even think of this moment as gesturing toward a set of dystopian “alternative facts” about 24-TET, which gradually overtake the music in subsequent passages.

At its densest state, the polyrhythmic unfurling of E ♭ 1 partials contains only eight distinct pitches (refer back to Example 16). By contrast, m. 20 alone contains sixteen 24-TET pitch classes (eight in the first piano and eight in the second piano) out of a possible aggregate of twenty-four, with several of these pitch classes also realized in multiple registers. Furthermore, as Steiger reprises and develops m. 20 in subsequent bars, he rapidly adds even more pitch classes. He revisits this material, for instance, in m. 34, mm. 36–38, and mm. 44–45, with new pitch classes introduced each time. In fact, by mm. 44–45, all possible pitch classes are exhausted. Example 19 reproduces this last pair of measures; here, the first piano presents a complete 12-TET pitch-class aggregate while the second piano presents its quartertone-altered doppelgänger, again via a consistent major 4th doubling. In Post-truth Lament , then, pitch-class saturation is initially coded as an “unjust” technique: instead of appearing within a perceptibly overtonal context, it helps to create a sensation of competing, alien duplicates of a 12-TET set between the two instruments.

Measures 47–51, which are reproduced in Example 20 , exemplify this material. The louder, foregrounded 5ths and octaves articulate the pitch-class set { E ♭ , E(-¼), F(-¼), F ♯ , A ♭ (-¼), A(-¼), B ♭ , B, C(-¼)}, while the quieter, backgrounded ostinato contains realizations of several pitch classes, including { C ♯ (-¼), D(-¼), G}.

Example 21 focuses on the contents of m. 50 alone and separates the two layers: the ostinato is summarized to the left of the dashed line, while to the right of the line the strident 5ths and octaves are shown in the order in which they appear in the measure. Example 21 also labels 12-TET pitch classes that the layers arguably instantiate; pitch classes assigned to the second piano and therefore flattened by a quartertone in their realization are placed in quotation marks. This amounts to a new approach to “unjust” aggregate formation in Post-truth Lament : whereas the major 4th doppelgänger material creates an “out of tune” effect by duplicating a 12-TET aggregate at a 24-TET interval, this new passage does so by splitting the contents of a single 12-TET aggregate between the two pianos, thereby deforming some of its tunings by quartertones.",

The appearance of these hybrid “overtonal aggregate” fields, as I will call them, serves an almost narrative function in Post-truth Lament ; over the course of later passages of the work, Steiger introduces the technique with varying degrees of clarity and imperfection, thereby gently and gradually hinting at a reconciliation between harmonic principles that had earlier resulted in divergent sonic results.",

This technique—which has been utilized by such composers as Webern, Carter, Lutosławski, and Powell—is in its traditional conception deeply rooted in 12-TET. Specifically, it generally involves utilizing many, and often all, of the 12-TET pitch classes; and it further involves assigning each of those pitch classes to a register, and often exactly one register, in pitch space. Thus, while there is some degree of flexibility built into the definition, the most prototypical pitch field of this sort contains exactly twelve pitches, all in 12-TET, with no octave duplications. It is also characteristic for such fields to occupy a fairly wide range of pitch space. (23)",

On the one hand, in many of his works Steiger uses a given pitch field to closely evoke the just tunings of the harmonic series, which prompts him to introduce non-12-TET intervals into the field and pull it out of the tuning universe within which the technique was founded. On the other, Steiger usually accommodates the original technique’s avoidance of pitch-class duplication across octaves; he does this by regarding each just-tuned pitch as a representative of the nearest 12-TET pitch class, with other representatives of the same pitch class (even differently tuned ones) typically not permitted within the same field. (24) In the abstract, the resulting “overtonal aggregate” field is therefore a hybrid of two philosophically distinct structures—i.e., the harmonic series’ theoretically infinite set of ratio-related frequencies and the closed world of an equal-tempered pitch-class space. In what follows, I examine two fields from later passages of Post-truth Lament , considering how they gesture toward, but decline to completely realize, a reconciliation between ideas previously cast in an antagonistic relationship.",

In this passage, the two pianos arpeggiate a pitch field based on an apparent fundamental of F1; the field is analyzed in Example 23 . As is evident from the figure, there are more than twelve pitches in the field; contrary to Steiger’s normative tendency to include only one representative of each 12-TET pitch class, Example 23 contains multiple representatives of several such pitch classes, no matter how the quartertone-altered pitches are parsed. (25) To my ears, the field also contains a more perceptible sort of outlier: the pitch E ♭ 3(-¼). Unlike the other pitches in the field, this pitch does not in fact correspond to a partial of F1. We could, however, hear it as a representation of its 7th partial voiced one octave “too low,” hence its labeling on the figure as the “3.5th” partial. I will further unpack the ways I hear this pitch and more fully discuss the harmonic identities it engenders later. For now, we might simply note that the contents of Example 23 are clearly evocative of Steiger’s overtonal aggregate field concept and the compromise between different conceptions of harmony it entails, but they evade realizing the technique to the fullest possible extent.

Measures 89–92 come from the start of the second half of the work, recalling the gradual polyrhythmic unfurling of E ♭ 1 partials from the beginning of the piece. In m. 93, however, the pianos continue articulating all of the pitches from the unfurling but unexpectedly add G ♭ 3(-¼) and A ♭ 5; in m. 94, the second piano further adds a pair of B(-¼)s in the bass register, and in m. 95, the first piano introduces F6. This creates a “poly-overtonal” harmony arguably drawing on the series of B0(-¼) and E ♭ 1 simultaneously. Example 25 analyzes the field, which persists for several more measures (until m. 101) beyond the excerpt shown on Example 24. Numbers below the pitches label them as partials of B0(-¼), while numbers above offer interpretations in light of an E ♭ 1 fundamental. Note how analyzing the field with recourse to one fundamental only would unusually require us to regard many pitches as being realizations of partials voiced one octave “too low,” while admitting a poly-overtonal interpretation enables a more comprehensive accounting of the pitches at register.

Furthermore, if the octave doubling of the fundamental in the bass register (likely for timbral reinforcement) is excepted, each 12-TET pitch class is realized without octave duplication. This harmony would therefore contain the trappings of a prototypical overtonal aggregate field were it not for the fact that it seems to be generated not from a single fundamental but rather from two at the same time. Just as the music satisfies the overtonal aggregate technique’s requirements in terms of 12-TET pitch-class representation, then, it undermines the listener’s sensation of overtonality by creating a complex inharmonic spectrum from the superimposition of what would in isolation be two purely overtonal chords. In this way, the piece continues to gradually move toward, but coyly avoid full realization of, a reconciliation between principles of overtonality and ET pitch-class aggregate formation.",

In an interview with the author, Steiger shared that he typically does not think of such pitches as being anomalously voiced when he is composing them. Instead, he imagines the fundamental of the governing harmonic series to be one octave lower than the surface of the music would suggest—thus transforming, for example, an apparent “3.5th” partial into the 7th partial of an implied virtual fundamental, with all other partial numbers similarly being doubled (for instance, an apparent 5th partial would become the 10th partial of such a virtual fundamental). Steiger suggested that he occasionally deploys this maneuver in order to very slightly counteract the harmonic series’ naturally lopsided spacing and instead distribute notes more evenly in pitch space, speculating that he may have inherited this preference from twentieth-century 12-TET composers, such as Webern and Powell (Rand Steiger, interview via Zoom, August 6, 2020).",

(27) Such a scenario occurs in mm. 55–64; recall Example 23’s summary of that passage’s pitch repertoire, where E ♭ 3(-¼) was labeled as the anomalous “3.5th” partial of F1. To my ears, this pitch sounds palpably like an outlier, not a “correctly”-voiced 7th partial above an imagined F0 fundamental. Here, the overwhelming majority of the pitches align with the rich natural harmonics and sympathetic resonances of the first piano’s F1; the fact that E ♭ 3(-¼) does not thus gives it something of a unique status. A number of other factors likely contribute to my hearing at this moment. For instance, a virtual F0 fundamental is, at approximately 21.8 Hz, nearly outside of the human hearing range; that E ♭ 3(-¼) is apparently in the “wrong” register if F1 is the fundamental might draw the ear’s attention to how its tuning departs from both the culturally familiar 12-TET set and the precise, just tuning of the 7th partial; (28) and the pitch further “sticks out” given the relatively small number of other pitches nearby in register. Within an otherwise “just”-sounding harmonic field, then, Steiger inserts a pitch that is more challenging for the listener (or, at least, this listener) to hear in a fully overtonal way.

Specifically, Steiger turns this same pitch, E ♭ 3(-¼), into a relative consonance by positing it as the “correctly”-voiced 5th partial within a pitch field based on a fundamental of B0(-¼). Using both overtone-class and pitch-class nodes and transformations, Example 27 summarizes this maneuver, which is similar in principle to the Eden modulation shown in Example 9. In that earlier example, we saw how Anderson takes advantage of the macrotonal system’s 24-TET rounding to pivot from a fundamental of C to a fundamental based on its 5th partial, E, with the 7th partial of C also becoming the 11th partial of E. Similarly, Steiger in this moment uses the quartertone grid to move from a fundamental of F to its 11th partial, B(-¼), with the 7th (or, as Steiger voices it in pitch space, “3.5th”) partial of F also becoming the 5th partial of B(-¼). Read in the context of Post-truth Lament ’s political message, this is a particularly powerful and suggestive moment: a pitch’s initially aberrant-sounding voicing palpably drives the music forward, generating an urge for greater harmonic “justice” that is—if only for one brief moment—fulfilled by this modulatory technique. So, too, is it striking that the interval between the two fundamentals in question, <F, B(-¼)>, is a major 4th—precisely the same interval that had contributed to a marked sense of harmonic “injustice” in earlier passages of Post-truth Lament .",

Writing on Schoenberg’s Piano Piece op. 11/1, for instance, Cross concludes that it seems as if the composer is “straining to reach back” to tonality even though he ultimately “cannot quite touch it” ( Cross 2008 , 58). I hear Post-truth Lament ’s overtonal aggregate fields as doing an analogous sort of labored searching, in that they seem to long for a full restoration not of the tonal but rather of the over tonal. Yet throughout the work’s seven and a half minutes, an unambiguous sense of harmonic “justice” remains elusive; as the music ends, it is almost as if we are hearing Steiger question whether it will ever again be otherwise.

This alteration of listening focus is perhaps the fundamental difference between conceiving of music in a temperament or in just intonation. The increased interest today in exploring perceptions of sound and time as fundamental materials of music invites a kind of listening, which the appreciation of just intonation also depends upon. ( Nicholson and Sabat 2018 , 29; italics original) An interest in listening to sounds “in their own terms” rather than “as part of a system of syntactic relationships,” as Hasegawa puts it ( Hasegawa 2008 , 197), is indeed an important trend in music of at least the past sixty years. This is not, however, what I sense Anderson’s and Steiger’s works to be inviting us to do. To the contrary, Eden and Post-truth Lament engender teeming networks of relationships that express not only these composers’ pluralistic harmonic influences but also the broader political realities they perceive in the world. I suggest that “context,” to borrow a word from Nicholson and Sabat, is crucial on many levels at once in understanding the work of these composers. Far from producing work that feels tentative or uncommitted, the theoretical blurriness engendered by drawing on both overtonal and equal-tempered pitch structures seems to be musically generative for these two composers and offers them possibilities for thinking in sound about complexities of life in the twenty-first century.",
