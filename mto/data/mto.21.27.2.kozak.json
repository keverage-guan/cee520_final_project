    "abstract": "Reich’sViolin Phasehas been mired in questions of time since its inception. In this article I present a theory of time in process music based on the notion of kinesthetic knowledge, and the synthesis of musical temporality through the generative (chronopoietic) and transformational (chronopraxial) acts of the body. I illustrate this theory with an analysis of Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s choreography toViolin Phase, arguing that the dance serves as a proto-theory of the piece by creating and transforming its temporal trajectory. I draw attention to the role of structural convergences and divergences between dance and music, as well as of the emerging “resulting patterns,” in establishing and maintaining an emotional connection between the dancer and her audience. By closely examining the relationship between the music and De Keersmaeker’s movements, how together they create the space of the dance, and how the energy accumulated through incessant repetition gives shape to the aesthetic event, I argue that the choreography draws attention to novel temporal aspects of Reich’s piece.",

In general, it is not uncommon to encounter statements to the effect that “music is a temporal art through and through” ( Begbie 2000 , 29); that “time in music is an active force, not a ‘mere formality’” ( Zuckerkandl 1956 , 247); that “music is predominantly an art of time” ( Monelle 2010 , 81); that since music lacks the solidity of a physical object, and therefore cannot endure in time, its expressive content is intimately connected with its temporality; that when it comes to music, time and meaning are “inseparable” ( Dufrenne 1973 , 270). For a critical assessment of the assumptions underlying these and similar pronouncements, see Kozak ( 2020 ).",

See, for example, Marcia Tucker’s statements about the 1969 performance of Violin Phase at the Whitney Exhibition titled Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials : “[Reich’s piece] offered no illusion of temporality . . . only a sense of an isolated present” which resulted from “a deliberate and unrelenting use of repetition” (see Tucker and Monte 1969 ); or Alan M. Kriegsman’s review, also from 1969, in The Washington Post : “as the repetitions proceed, rhythmic variations are introduced at an exceedingly slow rate, resulting in a kaleidoscopic compression and dilation of time. If it gets to you at all, the effect is hypnotic.” For commentary on these, see Cole ( 2014 ). More recently, Noble ( 2018 ) writes that “terms like ‘mystical,’ ‘narcotic,’ ‘entrancing,’ and ‘meditative’ are common currency in minimalist discourse, and the experience of time and timelessness is among the most central topics” ([51]). Michael Fried ( 1998 ) discusses the experience of time in minimalist plastic art.",

Stoianova, in particular, goes so far as to say that the goal of this music is goallessness, a concept that Shelley finds “too close to meaningless to be of much use” (50). Robert Fink ( 2005 ) also critiques the teleological/non-teleological binary; however, he replaces it with one of his own: between “classical” teleology of the music of “Beethoven, Brahms, Berg, the Beatles” and “recombinant” teleology of process music. In classically teleological pieces, the telos determines the form, such that a single tension-release arc encompasses the entire piece, and the scale of this arc is phenomenologically congruent to our perception of “quotidian bodily rhythms” (44). By contrast, recombinant teleologies may include tension-release arcs of different lengths and degrees of completion, or may create arcs on a scale that “far outstrips the ability of the individual human subject to imagine a congruent bodily response” (44).",

These two concepts have echoed throughout the philosophy of time—indeed, all philosophy—for centuries. The idea of becoming is found most prominently in the linear logic that began in ancient Greece and culminated in modern Western philosophy and science. The idea of being, while certainly explored by Western thinkers, has received its strongest statement in the ‘inward-looking, highly disciplined Buddhist philosophies in which Zen plays a prominent part’” ( 1988 , 16).",

It seems that already a few years after the piece’s 1967 premiere, discourse surrounding process music in general, and Violin Phase in particular, had shifted between different aesthetic commitments: from a Sol LeWitt-inspired idea of “directing focus away from authorial decision-making towards the seemingly autonomous aspects of phase shifting” ( Cole 2014 , 230), to highlighting the importance of the performer in bringing out the “resulting patterns” and creating the “raw materials” from which improvisation could be constructed. In fact, Reich himself backtracked from his mini-manifesto in a 1971 Musical Times interview with Michael Nyman, saying that “every piece of mine has some aesthetic decision in it as to exactly how many beats out of phase a pattern will shift against itself, and when the two voices become four, and when the four voices will become eight, and when the melodic resulting patterns will be doubled” (quoted in Cole 2014 , 238).",

Interest in this kind of inter-media analysis, which might be seen as an extension of choreomusicology but with a focus on how the visual and kinesthetic dimensions change one’s experience of the music, has been on the rise in recent years.

An early example of using non-musical artworks as sources of insight into minimal music can be found in Bernard ( 1995 ); however, whereas Bernard analyzes music in relation to art that was created for its own purposes, De Keersmaeker’s Violin Phase was created specifically to be performed with Reich’s piece.",

(4) Often emphasizing its goalless (non-teleological) nature, descriptions are rife with references to an endless present, to temporal suspension, to hypnosis and stasis. (5) Jonathan Kramer, for example, singles out Violin Phase as an example of music that is “uncompromisingly vertical” ( 1988 , 386). By verticality, Kramer means extremely nonlinear music, or music that obstructs listener’s normative processes of memory and expectation by severing connections with its own past and future. The listener encounters only an extended present, a static moment in which they are allowed to “merge with the music” (385) in an act reminiscent of Eastern meditative techniques. (6) Vertical music is said to force the listener to attend to “an arbitrarily bounded segment of a potentially eternal continuum” (386), which Kramer contrasts with a linear, “processive” temporality that arises when “some characteristic(s) of music are determined in accordance with implications that arise from earlier events in the piece” (20).",

Kramer writes: “we lose any point of reference, any contact with faster or slower motion that might keep us aware of the music’s directionality” (57).

In a meandering fashion, this trajectory ends up saturating the musical surface with some of the pitches that Cohn considers to be the most salient. (8) In particular, Cohn offers a formally rigorous, mathematically grounded analysis to demonstrate that this indirect saturation is due to a so-called deep scale property of the rhythmic pattern made up of the lowest and highest pitches in the repeating unit: C ♯ and E. “The transition between consecutive prolongation regions,” Cohn’s term for the states in which the shifted phases are locked with one another for an extended period of time, “always adds or subtracts beats to/from the previous pattern” (165). If one accepts that C ♯ and E are the most salient pitches in the pattern, the listener is actually able to “predict the approach of a goal” (164), thus contradicting Kramerian verticality.",

(9) More importantly, I think, Cohn’s analysis also demonstrates that the distinction between Kramer’s temporal categories loses much of its traction once it leaves the comfort of the philosopher’s armchair and finds its way into the analyst’s toolbox. It is obvious that Reich’s piece is characterized by growth and transformation because the very process of phase shifting is necessarily transformational. (10) In consequence, linearity and nonlinearity end up exerting limited explanatory power because, at heart, their primary concern lies in the musical meaning of continuity and a special kind of predictability that this continuity supports. (11) Kramer’s tipped hand reveals that his default mode of listening relies on what might be called “orienteering” strategies—strategies that allow one to find their place in the music, to know where they are at any particular moment, to know (more or less) how much time has passed and how much is left, and so on. Such task-based listening, in which the listener is saddled with mapping out the temporal terrain, always deflects the point of contact with the music to some moment that is not explicitly given to the listener’s consciousness. The focus implied by this strategy is at all times precisely on what is not happening right now, precisely on what is not the immediate content of experience. If the music fails to support this kind of listening—for example, when it consists of an unchanging context—then all that the listener is able to attend to is the present, which, for Kramer, makes this present “timeless,” hence vertical.",

But while this rightly acknowledges the agency that this listener brings to the musical encounter, the encounter itself is ultimately described in passive terms. The point here is subtle, but it bears emphasizing because it has profound ramifications for the way musical time is conceptualized and experienced. By positing different temporalities as characteristic of musical materials and systems governing how these materials are organized, Kramer paints himself into a corner in which the listener needs to conform to those temporalities if their experience is to be meaningful. (15) Missing from Kramer’s account is the recognition of the potential of the listener to effect one or the other strategy and what might fall out of the listening situation if this potential were actualized. By contrast, active listening is a process in which the relationship between the agent and the music undergoes constant change. Active listening to nonlinear music—even of the “uncompromisingly vertical” variety like Violin Phase —with a linear strategy does not have to be boring or frustrating; the piece does set up its own expectations, and these expectations are useful in guiding the experience of the listener, even if the nature of this experience is of a different kind than what interests Kramer.",

His dualist framework results in a hearing of Violin Phase that, for me at least, robs the piece of layers of significance by forcing the analyst to assume a definitive stance regarding the terms of the binary opposition. At best, these terms may lie on a continuum, but even then there is an injunction to spell out the exact placement of the experience along a single axis.

                "text": "[3.3] From the outset, I must stress two points. First, although the film depicting De Keersmaeker’s 1983 performance is heavily mediated through the use of dynamic camera techniques, I treat it not as an aesthetic object in its own right (which, of course, it is), but rather as a stand-in, or a convenient anchor, for a more general aesthetic event that outlives any of its visually captured exemplars (similarly to how we treat musical scores). My own experience of the dance encompasses not just this video, but also several live performances that I attended over the years, including those featuring different dancers. It is from this position that I embark on my discussion. This means, among other things, that I will not consider how the film’s director, Thierry De Mey, manipulates the camera to focus our attention on different aspects of the dance: De Keersmaeker’s facial expressions, her moving feet, the sand-covered stage, or the dramatic sequence in the final minutes of the performance. (19) This also means that I will not address the sand on which De Keersmaeker draws the enigmatic rosette, simply because for more than three decades Violin Phase has almost always been performed on an empty stage, and there is some evidence that the arenaceous inscription was an afterthought in the choreographic process. (20) While this has many implications for a hermeneutic reading of the piece—most obviously regarding the relationship of the dancer to herself through the traces of the steps she makes and subsequently erases—I will not explore any of them in this article. Moreover, in 2018 De Keersmaeker passed the baton to a new generation of dancers, Yuika Hashimoto and Soa Ratsifandrihana ( De Keersmaeker 2019 ), both of whom are members of De Keersmaeker’s dance troupe Rosas. I included Hashimoto’s rendition—from a 2018 performance at the “Échelle Humane” dance festival at Lafayette Anticipations—as an insert to the accompanying video because it illustrates very clearly both the steps and how the dance unfolds in space. Whereas the large screen in Example 1 illustrates De Keersmaeker’s performance, Hashimoto’s dance can be viewed in the bottom right corner within the video. Most importantly for my purposes, the video also demonstrates the striking difference in how the two dancers approach the timing of the dance and the relationship of their movements to the music.",

Nor is it an analysis of the dance as a standalone aesthetic event. Instead, it is a move that considers De Keersmaeker’s choreography as a prism for Reich’s Violin Phase , a notion emboldened by Ian Quinn’s comments about the role of analysis in process music. Specifically, Quinn points out that the high redundancy and low information content that characterize this music present a challenge to the analyst because the familiar act of “decoding” surface events and linking them to an underlying structure has already been “short-circuited” by the composer. There is no need here for a puzzle-cracking Enigma machine, so the analyst’s response to this challenge is to “turn the normal function of analysis on its head. Traditionally, analysis aims to reduce the information content of a piece . . .  by parsing it relative to some well-understood system of formal conceptual categories. Process music comes to the table already digested; its challenge to the analyst-as-interpreter is precisely the minimal challenge it presents to the analyst-as-parser” ( 2006 , 292–93). To me, turning analysis on its head suggests that instead of asking how the piece works, the interpreter starts by inquiring why it works. According to Quinn, this ultimately amounts to fantasizing: to creating theoretical frameworks that can enfold other musics, or even other phenomena, in an effort to generate new insights about the piece. After all, the etymological roots of theoria include sight, spectacle, speculation, feelings of wonder and astonishment. As I will argue, De Keersmaeker enacts just such a framework by creating a space in which we find process embodied both in the spectacle of the dancer’s gestures, as well as more transiently in the relationship between her and the audience. My goal is to encourage a new mode of hearing Violin Phase by reframing relentless repetition within the temporal trajectory created in front of the viewer by a moving human body. In short, trying to imagine an alternative to the linear/nonlinear binary stipulated by Kramer, I reflect on the ways in which De Keersmaeker’s dance unlocks a different avenue for experiencing time in Reich’s piece.",

And walking” (De Keersmaeker quoted in Gyselinck 2018 ). (21) This austere, vagabond lexicon of gestures draws viewers into De Keersmaeker’s aesthetic universe. The choreographer continues: “It’s a vocabulary which will make the audience members believe they’ll be able to do, too—movements people can see themselves doing as non-dancers.” Inspired by the unpretentious display, viewers repeatedly try out the material “at the bus stop after a performance. The potential for imitation is important, it is an important way for dancers to make a connection with their audience.” (22) With its insistent invitation to enact a congruent bodily response, the piece displaces the fourth wall, folding spectators into the performance and according their presence a vital role in co-creating the aesthetic event.",

Instead, time in music is constituted by a skillfully moving body having a particular kind of knowledge of what it feels like to experience and make sense of certain sonic events. This perspective is in line with the philosophical tradition rooted in the work of Henri Bergson and post-Husserlian phenomenology. (23) Here, I extend my earlier view to posit that this uniquely human time consists of the techniques and technologies (together subsumed under the term technics , (24) or more precisely in the present context, “chrono-technics”) that we use to cope with the incessant flux characteristic of our encounters with the world. Chrono-technics is underpinned by practical knowledge ( technê ) about how our different temporal techniques and technologies allow us to fold the various forms of flux into the temporalities of our lives. (25) Technê turns chrono-technics into a skillful act, in contrast to the mere passive experience of time, in which knowledge need not play a role. More to the point, technê is a generalization of experience, while technics is the means through which we instantiate our practical knowledge in the world. Chrono-technics is constituted by what I call chronopoiesis and chronopraxis , which for the moment we can roughly gloss as, respectively, the creative and sustaining dimensions of temporality. Chronopoiesis and chronopraxis together synthesize in the passage of time, specifically when the human agent actualizes the potentiality inherent in each moment. Below, I will flesh out these terms and further elaborate on their synthesis in the context of De Keersmaeker’s Violin Phase . [4] DE KEERSMAEKER’S Violin Phase",

(26) However, the choreographer is unequivocal about the timeline of her Violin Phase , stating that “unlike the musical score, my dance is not a mere slice of eternity. There is a clear beginning, a middle, and an end, with plenty of tension in between. It is not a display of Eastern meditation” (De Keersmaeker quoted in Bellon 2018 ). Although suggestions that the score slices through eternity are debatable in light of Cohn’s ( 1992 ) abovementioned analysis, De Keersmaeker’s reflection does imply that we can understand and experience the temporality of her Violin Phase as having a specific trajectory. I propose that this trajectory is shaped by three vectors converging onto the aesthetic event: (1) the extraction of “hidden” melodies from the musical surface by the violinist (what Reich calls “resulting patterns” or “resultants”); (2) the synthesis of the technics of time in moments of structural convergence and divergence between the dance and the music; and (3) the accumulation of physical and emotional intensity through the incessant repetition of the music and the co-occurring movements.

Guibbory’s tempo is a brisk 150 bpm, compared to Zukofsky’s 100 bpm. This makes Guibbory’s rendition flow much more smoothly, while Zukofsky’s, by comparison, feels more halting and pedantic.

This places the former much closer to the upper limit of entrainment. On the other end of the spectrum, Zukofsky articulates each eighth note at around 300 milliseconds (ms), while Guibbory does the same at 200ms. Again, the disparity here is considerable, such that the former is within the range of pulses that can be further subdivided into sixteenth notes, while the latter falls outside of that range. In effect, this means that, given the cognitive and bodily limits of the listener, the eighth-note pulse can function as the tactus in Zukofsky’s, but not in Guibbory’s, rendition ( London 2012 ).",

As such, it creates a higher ceiling of metrical levels than does Zukofsky’s recording, which means that it presents to the listener more possibilities for larger note groupings. One grouping that De Keersmaeker exploits in her dance is the non-isochronous division of the metrical cycle into 7 and 5 eighth notes. By using Guibbory’s recording, that grouping results in 1.4s for 7 eighth notes, and 1s for 5 eighth-notes. By contrast, Zukofsky’s would have resulted, respectively, in 2.1s and 1.5s. The former of these values is close to the duration of the entire basic pattern as played by Guibbory. We also see from the graph that, at 1.5s, the 5-grouping in Zukofsky’s version is slower than the 7-grouping in Guibbory’s. In all, the body’s own limits on entrainability would have made it difficult to articulate the 7+5 pattern with the kind of drive, energy, and fluidity that is evident in De Keersmaeker’s dance.",

Referring on a number of occasions to the “ Stehgeiger idiom”—a (typically Jewish) figure of a violinist conductor of Weimar Republic salon orchestras, later associated with German jazz—she remarks that “there is something klezmer-like about [Reich’s music]; somebody in the village grabs a violin and people start dancing their rondo” (quoted in Bellon 2018 ).

The choice of these figures (there are many of them) is largely up to the performer, and I want to thank Paul Zukofsky for bringing out several very interesting ones I never would have thought of without him. ( Zukofsky 1969 ) The producer, David Behrman, describes his own impression: From [m. 17] to the end, the loops are heard alone to allow the listener to hear all the figures available to him. In listening, one can bring out these and other combination figures by concentrating on them—a little like those puzzle drawings of geometric three-dimensional figures that can be flipped back and forth in space by an effort of will.

One rhythmic figure in particular, the gankogui/makwa pattern originating in Ewe drumming (shown here in Example 5 ), lends itself especially well to the process of phase shifting because each phase creates a unique pattern of attacks and rests, effectively “saturating the unfolding musical field with variety” ( Scherzinger 2019 , 291). It also happens to form the rhythmic backdrop of the basic pattern in Violin Phase . (30) Consider the non-double-stopped pitches of the basic pattern, C ♯ , F ♯ , and G ♯ , as seen on the bottom of Example 5. They constitute a rotated gankogui/makwa pattern (starting on pulse-class 4) with one articulation missing (marked with [x]). (31) The double-stopped pitches (A–E and B–E) belong to an accompanying axatse pattern (also with a missing articulation) which in Ewe drumming would be played on a rattle by the same name. These absent articulations make it easier to create a rhythmically odd grouping of 7+5, precisely the grouping that De Keersmaeker emphasizes in the beginning of her piece (more on this below).

First, notice that the musical surface derived from the gankogui/makwa pattern is maximally saturated without any overlap between the voices: each pulse-class is articulated at least once with a unique pattern at any one time (the shaded axatse region will not concern us here). Had Reich added another violin and continued to phase shift the basic pattern (see “hypothetical phase 3” on the bottom of Example 6), a similar saturation would have occurred after two more phase shifts, as I highlighted with a red border. Here, the added hypothetical phasing voice is marked in orange; as before, every pulse-class receives at least one articulation without any overlapping phases. However, there is an important difference with the pattern in m. 16, which leads me to a second point. With the exception of E, each pitch in m. 16 exemplifies a different rotation of the form [1 1 0 0] (where 1 indicates an attack, and 0 a rest; pitches C ♯ and B double each other’s rhythm). These are shown in Example 7 , and they are precisely the patterns that the violinists and the engineers bring out on the recordings, and on which the listener is invited to concentrate.

The basic pattern is truncated to a 4-cycle, which leads to two further observations. One is that the subdivision of the basic pattern engenders a sense that the tempo had increased: things simply change at a faster rate than before. This adds to the overall forward momentum of the piece, even in the absence of any alterations to the pulse. Second, the shorter motifs that the violinists bring out in mm. 19–21 fill the empty beats through the process of phasing, but they do not extend beyond the 4-count length of each subcycle. Such a tight confinement of the patterns to 4-eighth-note units may contribute to the feeling of mentally flipping back and forth between different impressions of the same multistable figure (as described above by Behrman), or perhaps of rotating a single layer on a Rubik’s cube.

Indeed, in his praise of De Keersmaeker’s Violin Phase , Reich is explicit that she “not only captures the formal aspects of the piece, but, during the extended resulting melodies near the end, goes to the heart of its underlying lyricism” ( Reich 2002a , 214). Whereas Cohn’s analysis focused solely on what he considered to be the “invariant” features of the piece—the beat-class organization of pitches—it is here, in this extra-compositional excess, that the drama of the work and the telos that Cohn painstakingly demonstrated are realized to the fullest extent. The significance of this moment is especially clear when one compares Guibbory’s recording to Zukofsky’s: with an exuberant, ecstatic gesture, the former unravels a knot that had been assiduously tied over the course of the piece; the latter mechanically fulfills what had been inevitable from the start.

(37) Unlike the dance duets in Clapping Music , Piano Phase , and Come Out , Violin Phase does not permit any clear mapping between the musicians and the dancers, in which the latter could visually represent the melodic lines produced by the former. This obscures in the visual domain what is perhaps the most audibly distinctive aspect of this corpus: the process of phase shifting. At the same time, it makes clear that De Keersmaeker was not interested in supplying a mere “music visualization” to Reich’s piece. (38) Rather, the dancer’s body adds another element that unfolds in counterpoint with the violins. (39)",

Each twist demarcates the subphrases that make up the basic pattern of the music, dividing it into asymmetrical groups of 7 and 5 eighth notes. After several iterations, De Keersmaeker adds a quarter turn to each twist, which eventually turns into a walk. Still twisting to the same 7+5 count, De Keersmaeker walks clockwise outlining a circle; after reaching the starting point she reverses direction, then once more after another full circle. (40) This could be described as the main “theme” of the dance, and it unfolds over the course of eight measures of the musical score (about four minutes of the fifteen-minute work). After this, coinciding with the start of m. 9 (3:57), a series of eleven “variations” (De Keersmaeker’s term; see De Keersmaeker and Cvejić 2012 , 29) adds and transforms movements that are similarly abstract: a jump in Variation 2 (5:13), (click to animate) a version of rond de jambes en dedans in Variation 3 (6:17), (click to animate) a pirouette and a floor knock in Variation 5 (8:35), (click to animate) Example 10 .

It is curious, for example, that although De Keersmaeker claims to have found in Reich’s music an invitation to dance, except for the 7+5 grouping in the beginning of Violin Phase , she mostly remains out of sync with the beat. Rather, there are relationships between music and dance that can be considered emergent , meaning that they cannot be known by examining the component media in isolation, but instead fall out of the dynamic interaction between sound and body. Each medium seems to have its own pulse. (Here I use the term to nominate a general sense of regularity, rather than the more narrowly construed musical tactus .)

The dancer’s movements at times exhibit a high degree of independence from the music in terms of small-scale tempo and duration, while also remaining sensitive to broader articulations of musical form, such as the emergence of new resulting melodies. “As the piece continues,” remarks De Keersmaeker, “I try, by changing the movement, to emphasize the melody that emerges out of the process. In that way, some variations do react to the changes in the music. But choreographically speaking, the accumulation in the music is treated differently, because I am alone” ( De Keersmaeker and Cvejić 2012 , 36).

Several examples of this can be found throughout the piece (see Example 10): the coincidence between the beginning of Variation 1 in the dance and m. 9 in the music (3:57); Variation 3 and m. 12 (6:17); and Variation 8 and m. 20 (11:12). By contrast, local convergence designates moments in which individual gestures are synchronized with individual sound events.

On the one hand, attenuation can be seen when the transitions from one dance variation to the next are imprecisely coordinated with transitions in the music. One example occurs at the onset of m. 19. By the time De Keersmaeker marks the transition from Variation 6 to Variation 7 by standing in the middle of the circle and swinging her leg (10:04), we are well into the shifting B–E double-stop that characterizes m. 19 (9:50).

In other words, it adds to the already accumulated feeling of regularity established by all the previous steps; it keeps the pulse going while simultaneously constituting it as such—as a pulse (in contrast to, say, an irregular sequence of steps). On the other hand, each step also creates a bodily response that is absolutely new, one that emerges from a field of pure possibility in which synchronization is but one option. Walking is not just a realization of the potential inherent in the situation, but an active response to the contingencies of the environment (for example, an uneven surface, a wobble in the body’s sense of balance, and so on). Coordinating bodily actions with sound is an achievement that results in the emergence of a unique temporality that both transforms existing patterns and generates new ones.

Although it has recently been found to hide a pernicious side ( Gelfand et al. 2020 ), synchronization is usually seen as a positive contribution to the wellbeing of a social group because it disciplines individual bodies and helps to obviate the tendency to freeload. Numerous studies have focused on the ways in which entrained behavior appears to increase empathy, a sense of social belonging, altruism, pleasure, and so on. (43) Broadly speaking, then, the reinforcement of regularity that happens when walking is synchronized with an external auditory pulse can be seen as a form of commitment to existing regimes of temporality. Such regimes include the habits of thought with which we conceptualize the process of abstracting objects from flux—for example, events that we call beats—and the techniques and technologies that serve as material support for these habits—for example, metrically organized music. (44) Though immaterial and ephemeral, beat and meter, together with the entire constellation of related concepts, exert powerful social pressures, to the point where change is incorporated into extant temporal schemata without much resistance, for instance when we claim that we somehow feel compelled to synchronize our walking with the music. Our commitment to these regimes means entrusting them with the authority to delimit the possibilities for conceptualizing change, or conceptualizing the ways in which we are able to enact the process of abstracting temporal objects from incessant flow. As we place ourselves in the custody of those regimes, compliance with their strictures ensures access to cognitive and bodily schemata that make interpersonal encounters and life in general more efficient.",

All activity is transformative activity; the doings or practices the human beings engage in are constantly altering the world around them” (20; emphasis original). Chronopraxis, despite its grounding in habits of time keeping, thus exhibits a propulsive creativity that pushes against the boundaries of temporal regimes. Each technically or technologically supported enactment of temporal regularity, for example, modifies the collective knowledge that undergirds the praxis of synchronizing our movements with sound. As Jonathan De Souza ( 2017 ) points out, habits are not immutable: they are subject to change through learning and unlearning, through use, reuse, and misuse. They are not re-enactments of stored motor programs, but instead contain within them mechanisms for adjusting to the contingencies of the environment. In consequence, every action we perform—each step we take in the walking scenario—engenders irreversible changes in how we conceptualize the category to which this action belongs—categories such as beats, meter, and others that we extricate from the sonic process with which we are synchronizing.",

Or we might even clap on every beat, step on every other beat, and bob our head twice as fast as we clap, producing a multi-layered rhythmic texture typical of many musical interactions. Importantly, transformation works within an existing system, making it possible to discover relationships between some new entity (for example, a musical event) and the method by which this entity came to be.

Here, I am drawing on the relational ontology developed by the French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty ( 1968 ), who argued that each present is necessarily open to the contingencies of the future. (45) Each present contains within it an inherent absence, an incompleteness that demands fulfillment. This absence imbues the present with infinite potential which is actualized by a skillfully acting body. The present thus actualizes the future by crystallizing this potential into a singular event. Komarine Romdenh-Romluc, Merleau-Ponty’s ardent commentator, puts it succinctly: “Through one’s activity, the future—what is presented implicitly as yet to come—becomes present and the present becomes past—what is presented implicitly as having been” ( 2010 , 249). Chronopoiesis is my term for this activity, a gesture or movement which, as it is enacted, brings into existence something that is absolutely unknowable in the darkness extending beyond our perceptual horizon. It is a generative gesture that enacts novelty, an improvisational bodily propulsion that constitutes the then of then-a in the <a, then-a> string explicated by John Rahn ( 1993 ) in his essay on repetition.",

Such asynchrony is necessary if there is to be a perceiver perceiving a percept, as Merleau-Ponty illustrated with a simple exercise. As you grasp a nearby object—say, a cup of coffee—touch your grasping hand with the other. Now focus on sensations flowing between the touched and the touching, between the felt and the feeling, between the subject (touching-you) and the object (touched-you). (46) Can you mentally grasp both of them at the once? The inability to do so suggests that the shift in perspective, like between two versions of a multistable percept (e.g., the duck-rabbit illusion), generates a brief moment in which you are neither the subject nor the object, but exist suspended in an interval that is absolute possibility, absolute becoming. It is in this interval that time becomes an ontological reality as possibility/becoming is actualized as a concrete being (subject or object).",

At best, we might feel an absence that demands fulfillment, but the nature of this fulfillment is not a given. Instead, each step that accompanies sound provides the necessary ground for conceiving of a continuity, because it carries the body’s physical energy, and this energy must dissipate or be transferred to another body part.

But this is not the kind of mechanical repetition that Kramer decried as quickly exhausting the work’s information content; instead, it is a vital repetition in the sense articulated by Rahn ( 1993 ). In particular, Rahn distinguishes between three forms of repetition, each one characterized by a specific relationship to the goal of the repeated action. The most passive category is what he calls “slavery,” or a kind of repetition that “lacks telos ” (50). There is no goal, no trigger that would end the incessant cycle of repetition, not even for its own sake. For Rahn, this is a state of boredom, of “Sartre’s hell” ( 1993 , 50). In his second category, répétition , or rehearsal, the global goal with respect to the repeated gesture is given in advance. “There is already an idea or picture of the whole thing repeated, to which successive presentations are supposed ever more closely to approximate” (ibid.). With a clearly defined end state, rehearsal thus forecloses any possibility of change or growth, imparting only a “wan glow of pseudo-life” to the thing that is repeated (ibid.). Every consecutive iteration is merely an improvement over the previous ones, a zombie-like approximation of “life” or “growth” that amounts to nothing more than “reanimation.” Finally, repetition proper “is repetition within a larger thing whose telos . . . is in the process of being formed” (ibid.). The essence of this repetition is “to point beyond the thing repeated to the thing being formed” (ibid.). In contrast to rehearsal, repetition is alive and focused on opening toward the unknown, “a process of continual transcendence” toward a goal that is always at an arm’s length (ibid.).",

Rahnian repetition is essentially a generative process, a process of creating structure, a change of context from which the repeated thing is abstracted and which gives the thing its meaning. It is through this repetition that a musical work becomes a temporally bounded event in which the bodily and affective trajectories of life can play themselves out, again and again. The piece becomes a model for life, or for possible lives, allowing the listener to “live alongside . . . and learn from” the temporal curves emerging from the music ( Rahn 1993 , 56). (49) In music, each repetition changes the context in which the thing is repeated, thus also changing the goal that is in the process of emergence. (50)",

These are moments in which the body is at its most vulnerable as the dancer alternates between breaking out of the “violence” of synchronicity ( Ernst 2016 ) and surrendering to its force.

Each gesture, each twist of the torso, each resolute step and brazen twirl adds to the overall intensity of the piece in a manner that does not follow an algorithm. This, in turn, is balanced by chronopraxial processes that fold the dancer’s movements into large-scale convergences with the musical structure, altogether creating a flexible and vital rhythm that breathes life into the piece. While it is true that the sequence of events has long been planned, their timing remains indeterminate, hence lacking a sense of inevitability that comes from a technologically imposed temporal mechanicism. Time, no longer an abstract entity that measures the duration of this interaction, itself begins to pulsate, as if set off by the resonance of the repetition. In other words, rather than repeating in time, the dancer’s transitions between synchronous and asynchronous movements trigger the repetition of time.",

Will the dancer succumb to the choronopraxial pressure of the musical time axis? Or will she persist in her emancipation and assume agency through acts of chronopoiesis? Folded into the aesthetic event by virtue of the intimacy that the dancer establishes with us—making us privy to the visual and auditory signs of her exhaustion—we are forbidden from remaining indifferent. These dramas build up momentum in a relentless drive toward the climax in Variation 10 (13:20), which absorbs all of the emotional and physical intensity accumulated over the course of the preceding variations. Note back in Example 10 how by this point in the performance the dancer is no longer bound by the radii, but instead traverses the entire length of each diameter, even several times, as if breaking through the space she herself created. Accompanied by a melody that also spills out of the rigid confines of the basic pattern—a pattern, recall, that through the process of phase shifting had already shrunk to a mere fraction of its former self—she launches into a spirited, vertiginous “gambol that ends in a near sob” ( Kisselgoff 1998 , 7).

Do their fantasies unfold in accordance with the unquestionable logic of algorithmic operations? Or, like us in our own dreams, do they imagine that which is beyond imagination itself, resonating with temporal perturbations and chronopoietic wobbles, glitches that expose the possibility of nothing short of life? Of course, there is no temporal regime more repressive and implacable than that which takes technological operationality as the source and model for human behavior. Reich found the blurred lines between electromechanical and human performance to be “a liberating and impersonal kind of ritual” ( Reich 2002b ) but it is necessary to filter his comments through the historical context of the late 1960s, when the public enthusiasm for space- and cybernetics-driven American technophilia was yet to be dampened by the industrial technological interventions in the Vietnam War ( Goodyear 2008 ). Today, when anxieties about the adverse impact of cybernetic interference in human lives—for example, in the form of surveillance technologies, or the AI-based criminal justice system ( Benjamin 2019 )—are at an all-time high, the childlike excitement of merging human and technical media in the act of performance seems quaint, at best.

De Keersmaeker’s Violin Phase , according to Brian Seibert ( 2014 , C2), was “an acknowledgement of the unavoidably human dancer in the mechanical process.” Her body is inscribed with the miniature temporal dramas that constitute the piece’s temporal trajectory. The dancer not only enacts the chrono-generative power of the human gesture, but invites us to participate in the event, and to take it with us as we leave the performance space. This gesture is infectious, addictive, even seductive in its apparent familiarity and lexical transparency. The audience embodies the very chrono-technical acts that unfold on stage, pushing and pulling and stretching the temporal regimes that, perhaps only for a moment (but maybe that is enough?), expand under the pressure of novelty. This is vividly underscored by the differences in timing between De Keersmaeker’s and Hashimoto’s performances, as seen in Example 1. The two dancers enact different pulses and create different moments of structural inclinations, signaling that it does not matter when exactly these occur, only that they occur. With each live performance, the temporal trajectory will be different, but each one will draw on its own terms to set up a dramatic contrast with the other movements of Fase , where there is a direct correlation between musical and kinesthetic pulse streams.",

The viewer, brought into the circle of intimacy drawn with painstaking effort—whether literally on sand or only in their imagination—cannot remain indifferent to the rainbow of emotions engendered by the spectacle. In fact, the feeling, like the dance, does not end with the final convulsive gesture, but spills out and contaminates other encounters with this music. The price of indulging in emotional flights may be high for some, perhaps not enough for others, but we all must be ready to pay. Watching De Keersmaeker’s dance in different contexts, under different conditions (some analytical, others more leisurely), has profoundly changed how I listen to Reich’s Violin Phase when I hear it on its own. The same waves of intensity, of sliding in and out of synch with the pulse, of building momentum until the final melody bursts through the thick surface, have infected my auditory experience. The mechanically unfolding process no longer seems so mechanical, and I can begin to imagine what machines might fantasize about.",

In this article I have argued that De Keersmaeker’s choreography can be seen as a proto-theory—a fantasy, an awe-inspiring spectacle—of Reich’s Violin Phase , in which the dancer does precisely that: she draws on the chronopraxial and chronopoietic dimensions of the technics of time to meticulously construct a dramatic temporal arc of her dance out of the accumulation of sensations and muscular efforts that her viewers are invited to co-create. Crucially, unlike the dualist framework proposed by Kramer, the generative and transformative powers of a moving body are not diametrically opposed endpoints of a continuum, but ingredients that we ourselves combine to enact the temporal trajectory of life.",

Even if this body happens to be of a highly trained dancer emotionally engaging her audience in an unfolding aesthetic event, the relationship that emerges between her and us, the viewers, already helps to shift the question from how process music works, to why . In the end, perhaps the contagious nature of this dance is precisely what is needed: the answer is that it works because our listening and viewing bodies resonate with those of the performers in ways that highlight their creative and transformative powers.",
