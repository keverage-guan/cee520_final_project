    "abstract": "It Takes Twelve to Tango(1984) has a subdivision series that unfolds in two dimensions: globally in the first beat of the 2/4 meter, and locally in the second beat. Though the eight subdivision series expressed in the second beat mostly proceed at the rate of one subdivision per measure, occasionally a subdivision will be repeated in two consecutive measures. Attempts to interpret these duplicated subdivisions reveal intersections between the subdivision series and a wide variety of other aspects of the piece, including the pitch-class array, hypermeter, and registral gestures. These non-systematic explanations lead to a meditation on the meaning and power of the systematic aspects of Babbitt’s music.",

There is one exception to this pattern: semiblock D1 omits the fifth member of the second beat subdivision series, not the seventh as expected, and appends the seventh subdivision to the end of the semiblock (see Table 1). One consequence of this deviation from the pattern is that every beat from measure 63 through measure 67 has at least three attacks in it. This might be in order to accelerate in preparation for the outbreak of faster subdivisions during semiblock D2. Alternatively, this change could be said to sharpen contrast with D2 because it emphasizes relatively steady subdivisions as opposed to the more uneven rhythms to come.",

I assume it is missing a barline because there are no other time-signature changes in the piece, and thus list two measures, 35a and 35b. There are three other apparent typos: there should be a bass clef in the left hand before the second beat of measure 29, the 8va begun in measure 38 should extend over the first beat of measure 39, and both occurrences of A6 in measure 32 should probably be C7 (this would complete the aggregate, avoid an anomalous octave, satisfy the linear counterpoint, and correspond to the dynamic scheme). Table 1 does not quite chart all of the rhythms in the piece: measures 31, 33, and 45 have sixteenth-note triplets in the place of expected eighth notes, and there are a few instances of expected attacks that are missing because of ties or rests (in measures 35b, 46, 49, 51, 53, 55, and 58). These missing attacks are almost all on the first sixteenth note of the beat, thus preserving the attacks that distinguish members of the subdivision series; the only exception is the ties through both expected attacks in the second beat of measure 49, discussed below. Curiously, all of the missing attacks except that in measure 46 occur during the second presentation of a duplicated subdivision. Perhaps since the subdivisions have already been heard, their literal restatement is less necessary. Table 1 obviously omits the many rhythmic, metric, and grouping subtleties suggested by intersections with other dimensions of the music, such as the dynamics and use of different registers.",

A lyne is an uninterpreted string of elements, typically an ordering of the twelve pitch classes (i.e., a twelve-tone series). An array is an arrangement of two or more lynes sorted into partially ordered ensemble aggregates. See Mead 1994 for a detailed discussion of these terms. To the extent that the pitch structure completes an all-partition array but the rhythmic structure does not quite complete the sixty-four possible combinations of subdivisions, one may posit that pitch structure is conceptually prior to rhythmic structure. Despite much talk of analogies between pitch and rhythmic structures, I have noticed that Babbitt’s pieces often conclude with the completion of a maximally diverse pitch construct but well before the completion of a maximally diverse rhythmic construct (typically a time-point array). The array used here (part of which is seen in Table 4) is related to that in Paraphrases (1979) and Four Play (1984). The pitch-class series (seen in Example 3 and Tables 3 and 4) was also used in Images (1979). See Mead 1994 , 159 and 271; and Mead 1984 , 330.",

Because the piece’s array uses each member of the series class exactly once (it is a hyperaggregate) and the series has no order-preserving invariances longer than two pitch classes (because there are no two segments of the series longer than two pitch classes that can map onto one another via the interval-preserving operations, nor any retrograde-symmetrical segments), each reference to the series that is longer than two pitch classes corresponds to a single place in the array. Dynamics are used as an index of distance between the reference and the source: if the reference is to a series form in the current block, the dynamic is piano ; if the reference is to an adjacent block (on either side), the dynamic is mezzo piano ; two blocks away is mezzo forte ; and three blocks away is forte (this is similar to the dynamic scheme of About Time (1982); see Mead 1987 , 127–18 or Mead 1994 , 214). Since only the first and last blocks are three blocks away from another block (namely, each other), they alone have forte indications. Longer references to the series are marked by longer stretches without a dynamic change, though not all such stretches indicate long references because there are occasionally adjacent references to the same block. There are two references to the complete series, in measures 1–2 and in the last measure, measure 75. The reconciliation inherent in the last measure because of the return to sixteenth-note subdivisions is reinforced by the return to the series for the first time since the opening measures. Some of the difficulties regarding the perception of surface references to the array are discussed in Dubiel 1997 .",

As the first sixteenth note is always attacked, the piece has a regular, audible pulse. The last member represents the empty set and is filled by a string of even note values whose attacks do not intersect with any of the possible sixteenth-note attack points except the first. These even notes may divide the quarter note into one (that is, it may be undivided), three, five, or seven. The series proceeds via gradual development, each subdivision until the last only differing from the previous by either the addition or subtraction of one attack or the shifting of one attack by one sixteenth note. Since the first two subdivisions present the habanera rhythm common in tango, this gradual development produces a steady move away from the familiar pattern ( Barulich and Fairley ). The series may be grouped into four pairs: the first two subdivisions have two attacks each, the third and fourth have three, subdivisions five and six begin a progressive filling of the beat, and the final two divide the beat evenly. The absence of sixteenth notes in the final subdivision means that each presentation of the series ends with the impression of a ritardando (division into one or three) or a flourish (division into five or seven).

These repeated subdivisions effectively divide the piece into eight sections, which will be called “semiblocks” for reasons to be explained shortly.

Before getting to possible interpretations of these duplicates, I should mention that every rhythmic feature discussed so far corresponds to aspects of the pitch structure. The fifty-eight filled slots in Table 1 each correspond to one of the fifty-eight aggregates of an array that uses all partitions of twelve lynes into parts of six or fewer elements. (7) That is, most aggregates extend over one measure (with the aggregate boundaries precisely at the barlines), but if there is a repeated subdivision they extend for two measures (this can be seen in Example 2). The array is divided into four nearly discrete blocks, which have complete statements of a series form in each of the twelve lynes, and eight semiblocks, which present six notes of a series form in each lyne, completing a Schoenbergian hexachordal aggregate in each of the six registers. (8) The semiblocks correspond to the columns of Table 1, which are labeled using letters and numbers to show the grouping of semiblocks into blocks. All of the semiblocks have seven aggregates except for B2 and C1, which have eight. The direct correspondence between subdivisions and aggregates explains why only the semiblocks with eight aggregates contain all eight possible second-beat subdivisions. Since the number of subdivisions and aggregates in semiblocks B2 and C1 is exceptional, the “extra” subdivision—that which is also found in the first beat and would normally be omitted in the second beat—is appended to the end of the semiblock and thus does not interfere with the established pattern (the situation is similar in semiblock D1; see footnote 6).",

This connection between alternating blocks corresponds to another aspect of pitch structure.

Reading that pattern as hypermetrical requires understanding the emphasis of a duplicated subdivision or longer-than-usual aggregate as accentual, which is surely contentious and may not be generally applicable, but as the piece begins with the only unambiguous reference to a classic tango rhythm, heard twice in measures 1–2, it seems plausible to understand the beginning of the piece as similarly using the four-bar hypermeter most common in tango. The / 2 11/ hypermeasure is also a fourfold expansion of the habanera rhythm itself, absent the sixteenth note. The pattern does not continue, for the beginning of A2 in measure 11 interrupts it, but it does return at the end of the piece. The only duplicate in semiblock D2 allows for its eight measures to be metrically analyzed as / 1 111- 2 11/. There are at least two ways to understand this return. The touch of reconciliation that can be heard in the last bar for reasons discussed above may be supported by this return to the hypermeter of the opening. Or, it could be said that even though semiblock D2 is further away from the classic tango rhythm than any other part of this piece because it has non-sixteenth note subdivisions in the first beat of every measure, it is nonetheless grounded in the norms of the piece by this reference to the opening hypermeter.",

The ties through those attacks create the only uninterrupted duration in the piece that extends more than five sixteenth notes; this sustain appears to function like a Grand Pause establishing an arrival in measure 50.

Until measure 50, every aggregate but two (those in measures 21 and 44) is partitioned into at least three of the six distinct registers, but the three aggregates between measures 50 and 55 use only one or two registers. (13) The partitioning of measures 52–53 emphasizes this distinction by using adjacent registers and only the lowest note of the upper register, which means that the pitches in that aggregate are entirely contiguous. The array for the relevant semiblock is shown in Table 4 , the full series forms used can be found in Table 3, and the score of this passage is in Example 4 .",

There is a gradual ascent from the lowest register in measure 50 to the highest register in measures 57–58. Pitch-class notation in the array obscures this a bit: measures 54–55 are higher than measures 52–53 even though IV is the uppermost register in both aggregates, because 5 is the lowest pitch class in that register (as in all others in this piece) and 3 is one of the highest. The array violations noted in Table 4, in which pitch classes 5 and t in measure 56 appear an octave lower than expected, make this registral gesture smoother by helping to bridge the gap between the highest and lowest registers. (14) Duplicates serve to extend a gesture implicit in five aggregates of the array over nine measures. The relative breadth of this section of the piece, caused by the duplicates, the long ascending gesture, and the missing attacks, ends quite suddenly in measure 59. There is a return to the use of all of the registers and one-measure aggregates, and the piece continues with both of these features until the end. (15)",

As Joseph Dubiel has argued, the actual power of the twelve-tone and time-point systems to strictly determine any given moment is usually vanishingly small, and there are no good reasons to necessarily prioritize “precompositional” explanations (cf. Dubiel 1997 ). But one thing these systems do provide is an interpretative context in which to think about curious anomalies such as the duplicated subdivisions or such apparent violations as the transposed pitches in measure 56. They may not provide answers to the questions raised, but they lead to situations in which interesting questions might arise, and suggest a language in which to speculate about them.",
