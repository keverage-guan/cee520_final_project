Given \na suspension such as 7–6 in the upper part, what could \npossibly raise doubt as to the identity of the harmony on the \nweak beat? By CP, the seventh has no independent status, and \ntherefore the interval of the sixth conceptually underlies the \nentire measure. Since the interval of the sixth, in strict \ncounterpoint, can be associated with only one “harmony,” \nnamely a (consonant) sonority, there can be no other \nharmony in this measure in the first place. In other words, \nthere is no question here at all of assuming “a second \nharmony” on the upbeat, as Schenker would have us believe. \nQuite to the contrary. Only if one assumed, in violation of \nthe rules of fourth-species counterpoint , that a “harmony” other than a sonority is present on the downbeat , is \na \nchange of harmony within the measure at all conceivable.",
