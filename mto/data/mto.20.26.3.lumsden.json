    "abstract": "In this article, I examine a cluster of music theory essays by Oliveria Louisa Prescott (1842–1917), which were published between 1886 and 1891 inThe Girl’s Own Paper(TGOP), the most popular periodical for young women in Victorian England. Although little known today, Prescott sustained a vibrant musical career in London as a composer and teacher, and her articles on music theory regularly appeared in major periodicals such asThe Musical WorldandTGOP.Prescott’s work forTGOPpresents a rare opportunity to explore music theory that was not just written by a woman, but also intended for a genteel female audience in the Victorian era. Her articles include explanations of fundamental theoretical subjects (cadences, basic harmonic progressions) as well as short analyses of solo piano works by Beethoven and Mendelssohn. But these articles are also noteworthy for their discussions of more advanced theoretical topics (such as chromatic harmony), concepts that might seem surprising for a popular periodical for young ladies. Mainstream journalism is often devalued as a “less serious” form of intellectual discourse, but Prescott’s work complicates stereotypes of ignorant amateur female musicians and the so-called “private” sphere, and it demonstrates how print journalism could serve as a vital public platform for the circulation of music theory among young British women in the Victorian era.",

Prescott’s Concert Finale had at least three major public performances. Her duet arrangement was performed on a Musical Artists’ Society concert in London on June 7, 1884; she played one of the piano parts herself ( “Concerts” 1884 , 374). To my knowledge, the first performance of the original version (with Madame Viard-Louis as the piano soloist) occurred on an orchestral concert at St. James Hall on April 23, 1879; the program also included Beethoven’s Symphony No. 7 in A major, op. 92. A review described Prescott’s piece as “an animated movement, very simple in character, and not calling for particular remark” ( “Madame Viard-Louis’ Concerts” 1879 , 267). The original version was also performed in Birmingham on May 7, 1884, by the Edgbaston Amateur Musical Union, along with Mendelssohn’s Symphony in C minor, op. 11, Beethoven’s “Creatures of Prometheus” Overture, and Sterndale Bennett’s “Naïdes” Overture ( “Music in Birmingham” 1884 , 340).",

I believe that Prescott’s choice to combine “nursed” with “encloses”—and the phrase “one whole”—denotes a mother’s embrace while nursing her child, but she could also be using “nursed” in a more general sense, to refer to nursing the ill. Sick nursing was unequivocally associated with the female sphere in this era, and many articles in TGOP discuss women’s supposedly innate abilities for invalid nursing (see especially Westland 1887 and Watson 1888 ). Professional nursing had also become a prominent career for British women, in part because of the popularity of Florence Nightingale (1820–1910), who trained female nurses during the Crimean War, wrote the foundational book Notes on Nursing (1859), and created the first secular nursing school in the world at St. Thomas’s Hospital (London) in 1860. Numerous articles on nursing as a profession for women are found in TGOP , such as Caulfeild 1880 , 1886 ; Medicus 1882 ; “Work for All” 1883 ; “The Unvarnished Side of Hospital Nursing” 1888 ; and “The Costumes of Hospital Nurses” 1890 .",

Full dress toilets, Court Dresses, and wedding-gowns are all favoured with long trains, and on them only are they to be seen” ( “Frocks and Gowns for the Month” 1893 , 408). Prescott was not always consistent with her use of metaphors for codas, and sometimes chose different metaphors to describe different kinds of codas. In an earlier article for TGOP on the second movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in D major, op. 28, she explains that the coda “is the end of the movement, called the ‘coda,’ the meaning of which word we may understand if we think what is a caudal appendage. It is not a piece of trimming like the tail of a gown, but a real part, like the tail of a dog” ( 1889 , 663). Perhaps Prescott used a different metaphor in this earlier article because Beethoven’s sonata is significantly longer than the Mendelssohn movement (and its coda is much more substantial as well).",

He notes that “dominant ninth chords are most often found with root omitted . . . [C]omposers have shown a distinct preference for the incomplete forms of these chords over the comparatively thick and heavy effect of the ninth chord with root” (176). He also emphasizes that it would be “illogical to refer to the leading-tone as ‘root’ of the chord” (177). Damschroder’s textbook Tonal Analysis: A Schenkerian Perspective ( 2017 ) often describes diminished seventh chords as ninth chords with missing roots, and uses a bullet symbol to indicate the absent root. He argues that chromatic chords like diminished sevenths contain chromatic inflections (“surges”) that propel harmonic and linear motion; these chords can also “evolve” from their original diatonic origin (for example, by having a missing root).

The next fifth is not used to generate a “fundamental” chromatic chord because it is “not a note of the diatonic scale, being a little too sharp,” but it can be used as part of a chromatic chord (60). Day describes the generation of these “fundamental” chromatic harmonies in more detail on pp. 62–64. For a similar discussion of the origins of “fundamental discords” see Macfarren [1867] 1892 , 96–98, and 122. In his appendix to the second edition of Day’s Treatise , Macfarren explains that the dominant, supertonic, and tonic create “fundamental” chromatic chords because they “consist of notes of the harmonic column naturally generated by a chosen root or fundamental note”; they are not to be confused with Rameau’s or Logier’s use of the term “fundamental,” which has “a different meaning” ( Day [1845] 1855 , 196). Macfarren and Day both emphasize that in the free (chromatic) style, fundamental chromatic chords may be used within a key without preparation and “without involving any change of tonality” ( [1867] 1892 , 122). Day argues that the fundamental chromatic chords do not require preparation because they are “already prepared by nature [the overtone series]” ( [1845] 1855 , 60).

But young women’s periodicals published a century earlier, in the late nineteenth century, reflect a different perspective that prioritizes music as an important part of young women’s education and development. In the late 1880s, The Girl’s Own Paper (the most popular periodical for young women in England) ran a short series of articles on music theory and analysis by Oliveria Louisa Prescott (1842–1917). Prescott’s work for The Girl’s Own Paper is significant for several reasons. As an early historical example of “public” music theory, her articles illustrate one of the primary rewards of public work in the humanities—the chance to reach a wider, more diverse audience. J. Daniel Jenkins describes how public music theory involves “an eclectic collection of scholarship, journalism, podcasts, videocasts, and other various items” that are “accessible to a general public” ( 2017 , paragraph 3). In recent years, scholars have revealed important insights about the myriad ways that public music theory has helped educate audiences; this scholarship has also expanded contemporary conceptions of what music theory is and what music theorists do. (1) However, this research has largely focused on contributions since the 1950s. Prescott’s articles thus offer an earlier, nineteenth-century perspective on public music-theory making. Finally, her writings present a rare opportunity to examine music theory that was not just written by a woman, but specifically intended for a female audience during the Victorian era.",

Third, I turn to some of the more advanced theoretical content in these articles, including voice leading and chromatic harmony, examining how her articles contain a level of theoretical detail that is surprising for a magazine for young women, and not found in other contemporaneous analyses of the same pieces in the British press. I conclude by discussing her emphasis on the importance of theoretical understanding for women, and how her views intersect with contemporaneous debates about the changing status of women in late nineteenth-century Britain.

Her orchestral and chamber works were performed in concerts during the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s, and some of her music was published, although many of her pieces (especially her large-scale orchestral works) have not survived. (5) Prescott was featured in an 1887 article on women composers in The Englishwoman’s Review ; the author emphasized that “although the name of Miss Prescott is not so prominently before the British public as that of many ladies who have achieved success as composers through some ephemeral melodious trifles, from an artistic point of view her career is of more interest, owing to the high standard she has hitherto retained in her compositions” ( de Ternant 1887 , 59). Prescott gained some recognition for her compositions: her Symphony in B flat, one of the first symphonies composed by a British woman, received third place (“high commendation”) in the Alexandra Palace Symphony Competition in 1876 ( Fuller 2018 , 155; “Notes” 1876 , 265). (6) During her years at the Academy, Prescott completed several other large-scale works that were performed on RAM concerts at St. James’s Hall, including her Overture in C minor (“Tithonus”), Symphony in D minor (“Alkestis”), and Magnificat . (7) Unfortunately performances of Prescott’s orchestral music dwindled after her years at the RAM; her orchestral music was never published, and has been lost. (8) One of the few instrumental pieces that has survived is a piano duet arrangement of her Concert Finale ( Example 2 ), a lighter, more popularly-oriented work originally for piano and orchestra that (as the score’s title page notes) was “composed for the end of a miscellaneous programme.” (9) Example 3 .

Some of her work as a public music theorist was eventually published in book form: a selection of her articles from The Musical World were reprinted as Form, Or Design, In Music ( 1882 ), and material from a six-week public lecture series in 1893 was later published as About Music, and What it Is Made Of: A Book for Amateurs ( 1904 ).

Established in 1880, by the end of its first year it sold more than 250,000 copies weekly (double that of its “sister” publication The Boy’s Own Paper ), and continued to dominate the market for decades. (17) Published every Saturday and priced at the affordable rate of one penny for its first twenty-nine years, each issue was sixteen pages long and featured a heterogeneous assemblage of items, including short stories, serialized fiction, poetry, and illustrations, as well as non-fiction articles on a dizzying array of topics, such as fashion, childcare, domestic life, education, careers, and music ( Barger 2016 , 21; Moruzi 2012 , 84). It is important to emphasize that the “girl” in the magazine’s title is something of a misnomer. TGOP was not a children’s periodical; during this era other periodicals were published for children, which contained more juvenile content. (18) As Barger, Moruzi, and others have explained, TGOP was supposedly intended for women between fifteen and twenty-five, but the actual age of readers of the magazine varied wildly—correspondents’ ages ranged from six-year-olds to mothers, self-proclaimed “grey-haired” readers, and grandmothers. (19) Skelding argues that Charles Peters, who edited the magazine from 1880 to 1907, “deliberately fostered the notion that the G.O.P. appealed to all generations of women” ( 2001 , 40).",

But music was still a central part of TGOP : Barger ( 2016 , 1) notes that more than 1300 of the 1500 issues of TGOP published between 1880 and 1908 contained some kind of musical content. (20) The broad range of musical features published in TGOP reflected the varied scope of the periodical as a whole, and included: fiction and poetry about musicians, primers on musical instruments, instructional advice about performing and learning music, printed scores for performance, short descriptions of recently published compositions, composition competitions, and columns on other topics that were tangentially related to music, such as “how to” articles about creating needlework and painted decorations for your piano ( Miller 1885 ; “A Pretty Pianoforte Back” 1897 ). Barger emphasizes how TGOP had a significantly greater amount—and variety—of musical articles and features than its “sister” publication The Boy’s Own Paper (46–48). For Barger, the profusion of musical content in TGOP reflects widespread views of Victorian womanhood, in which amateur music-making was connected to the domestic realm and considered an appropriately feminine pursuit that helped enhance a woman’s femininity. As Barger explains: The music making in TGOP kept its female readers safely in the home setting on instruments presenting a graceful appearance in performance. . . . And music, which occupied hours of practice but whose performance seldom led to status or income, fit in nicely with society’s expectations for these stay-at-home maidens. (49–50) Thus, Prescott’s articles were one small piece of a much larger editorial vision of TGOP , in which music was presented as an important component of female development and womanhood alongside other appropriately “female” topics, such as beauty regimens, romantic relationships, and fashion.

She frequently uses gendered discourse in her writing, and her (often florid) descriptions involve imagery frequently associated with the female domestic sphere, such as fashion, flowers, and ideas of “home,” caring, and emotional connections with friends and family. Of course, these are all gendered subjects associated with well-worn stereotypes of “proper” womanhood, which intersect with “separate spheres” ideologies that were pervasive in the Victorian era, in which “each sex was to have its own distinct sphere of influence” ( Burstyn 1980 , 31). In an 1884 essay (published just two years before Prescott’s first article for TGOP ), John W. Burgon emphasizes women’s innate connection to the domestic sphere—to “whatever belongs to and makes the happiness of Home ”: Home is clearly Woman’s intended place; and the duties which belong to Home are Woman’s peculiar province . . . And it is in the sweet sanctities of domestic life,—in home duties,—in whatever belongs to and makes the happiness of Home , that Woman is taught by the SPIRIT to find scope for her activity,—to recognize her sphere of most appropriate service.

Ruskin’s Sesame and Lilies (1865) contains two lengthy essays outlining the innate differences between men and women. For Ruskin, men and women “are in nothing alike” and the “separate characters” of each gender depends on ensconcing women entirely within the private, domestic sphere ( [1865] 1905 , 121). Ruskin maintains a set of strict binary oppositions between the genders. He explains that “the man’s power is active, progressive, defensive. He is eminently the doer, the creator, the discoverer, the defender” (121). In contrast, women’s “intellect is not for invention or creation, but for sweet ordering, arrangement, and decision. She sees the qualities of things, their claims, and their places . . . And wherever a true wife comes, this home is always round her . . . home is yet wherever she is; and for a noble woman it stretches far round her . . .

In her important historical study of women and music in late-Victorian Britain, Paula Gillett stresses that “like other areas of social and economic life, the world of nineteenth-century music practice, both amateur and professional, was sharply divided by gender” ( 2000 , 3). For example, in his wildly popular book Music and Morals ( 1871 ), H. R. Haweis included a separate section on “Women and Music” that emphasizes the inherent associations between domestic music-making and the female sphere. (23) Haweis explains that music provides a vital outlet for women, since “the emotional force in women is usually stronger, and always more delicate, than in men” (112). Haweis describes how music-making offers “a power of relief and a gentle grace of ministration little short of supernatural” for the “many thousands” of women “in our placid modern drawing rooms” (114). Clearly, TGOP was not alone in connecting amateur music-making with the female sphere because of its associations with emotion, domesticity, and the home. Example 5 .

As Ruth Solie argues, “there is no doubt that domestic music-making, and especially piano playing, had become thoroughly associated with young women by the middle of the nineteenth century” ( 2004 , 89). (24) Barger notes the prominent role the piano played within the pages of TGOP : during the first three decades of TGOP ’s publication, the piano was showcased in virtually all facets of the magazine’s production, from actual musical content (scores, music articles) to prose, poetry, and even non-musical features such as fashion (several examples will be discussed below). (25) The images shown in Examples 5 and 6 provide a visual representation of how piano-playing women were typically depicted in domestic settings in TGOP . Prescott’s emphasis on the piano in her articles is entirely in keeping with this editorial vision of TGOP , which reflected broader cultural ideals regarding women, pianos, and the domestic sphere. As Haweis proclaimed in Music and Morals , “That domestic and long-suffering instrument, the cottage piano, has probably done more to sweeten existence and bring peace and happiness to families in general, and to young women in particular, than all the homilies on the domestic virtues yet penned” ( 1871 , 115).",

One particularly striking simile appears in an article about Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in G minor, op. 49, no. 1, where she describes the key relationships in the second movement (Rondo). Prescott notes that the middle section of the lengthy G-minor episode (mm. 16–78) contains a modulation to B ♭ major (mm. 30–64). She employs a vivid phrase to emphasize how the B ♭ -major section is enveloped within G-minor material: “It is this return to the G minor passage which encloses the episode in one whole; the B flat song [mm. 30–64] being, as it were, nursed by the repeated G minor” ( 1887b , 556; my emphasis). Prescott’s use of the colorful verbs “nursed” and “encloses,” along with the phrase “one whole,” suggests the image of a mother feeding her child. In the Victorian era discussions of breastfeeding often focused on the unique bond it creates between mother and child, which typically aroused potent glorifications of the feminine sphere. As Ruskin exclaims, “this is wonderful to me—oh, how wonderful!—to see the tender and delicate woman among you, with her child at her breast” ( [1865] 1905 , 140). An 1881 article in TGOP begins with a lengthy section about breastfeeding, which emphasizes how “no artificial food can possibly be so good for an infant as its mother’s milk . . . [A] child thus nourished has a far better prospect of life and health than one brought up by hand [bottle]” ( Lamb 1881 , 699). The author characterizes nursing as a woman’s “duty and her privilege . . . A mother who deserves the name delights in self-sacrifice for the sake of her children, and notably during their helpless days” (699). (26)",

Practical advice about men and romantic relationships also regularly appears in the “answers to correspondents” section. For example, a response to “Troubled One” advises, “Why did you allow this very excellent young man to kiss you on several occasions when you were alone? You should have objected on the first attempt; and said that you could not allow such familiarity except from an engaged lover” ( “Answers to Correspondents” 1891a , 384). (27)",

The author spends the most time admiring roses, which he describes as “the flower of love and beauty”; the author stresses that “No other [flower] has been more highly praised by poets in every country and in all past times,” which is why roses “take a leading place in speaking the language of flowers” (250).

Countless Victorians associated the supposedly delicate, emotional character of women with flowers. Ruskin notes that there is “a difference between the making of a girl’s character and a boy’s—you may chisel a boy into shape, as you would a rock, or hammer him into it, if he be of a better kind, as you would a piece of bronze. But you cannot hammer a girl into anything. She grows as a flower does ” ( [1865] 1905 , 131; my emphasis). Haweis employs a similar comparison when he discusses women’s inherently emotional nature (which he characterizes as women’s “natural, dramatic feeling”) and their reactions when listening to music: “At times she is shaken and melts into tears, as the flowers stand and shake when the wind blows upon them and the drops of rain fall off” ( 1871 , 112).",

                "text": "[3.11] In the following excerpt, Prescott invokes romantic love—and roses—to enrich a digression about analysis and interpretation she includes as part of her article on Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in E-flat major, op. 7: There is no rule as to what music means. It means a feeling, doubtless, but what causes that feeling may be one thing in one person, and another thing in another person. A tender phrase in the music may mean that the composer was thinking of the beautiful curve of the lady’s lip as she smiled upon him one day; or it may mean that as he wrote it he remembered the tender thought that was in his mind when he gave her the first primrose of the year. A fiercer phrase may have been suggested by the only unkind word his friend ever said to him, or by the rough answer he once gave her, and regretted ever after. ( 1888 , 408) Prescott includes this lengthy passage after describing Beethoven’s op. 7 sonata as “the Beloved” because of its dedication to “a great and noble lady” (the Countess Babette von Keglevics) as a possible token of their relationship ( 1888 , 408). This paragraph serves several important purposes. First, the location of this passage—just before she begins her analysis of the sonata—helps to create a transition for her readers into the more technical theoretical content that comprises the rest of the essay, which features theoretical topics such as form and key relationships, voice leading, and chromatic harmonies (her analysis will be discussed in more detail in the next section of this article). Second, Prescott argues that musical meaning is fluid, not fixed—there is no way to determine unequivocally the exact meaning of a work, or a composer’s intention. Her choice to include several vivid impressions of an imagined love affair (the couple’s argument, or “the beautiful curve of the lady’s lip”) as a way to explain her broader points about musical meaning dovetails nicely with the origin story she provides about the sonata, and makes perfect sense within this larger context. But this passage also presents a romantic account that is entirely in keeping with the overall content of TGOP , with its strong associations between romance and the female sphere. Prescott’s decision to dwell on the minutiae of a romantic relationship in such detail (especially given the article’s relatively short length, three pages) ultimately helps to express her deeper philosophical ideas about subjectivity and analysis in a way that reflects the typical tone of TGOP .",

For example, The Monthly Musical Record printed all of Carl Reinecke’s The Beethoven Pianoforte Sonatas—Letters to a Lady in seventeen installments between July 1896 and August 1898. (30) Reinecke’s work is organized as a series of letters to an unnamed amateur female musician whose musicianship he clearly respected; at the end of his first letter he proclaims, “although a witty person has asserted that the step from dilettante to artist is often only a small one, yet always such as the dilettante never can take, I am still of opinion that, for all that, there are dilettantes who surpass many musicians in certain respects, and I believe you are to be numbered among these” ( 1896a , 147; italics in the original). (31) Nonetheless, his accounts of the sonatas are strikingly vague and focus primarily on performance-based issues such as dynamics, ornamentation, and phrasing. His notably short discussion of op. 7 does not mention its dedication or any possible connections with romance, but simply contains a few brief suggestions about performance practice. The only specific detail he provides about the first movement is a recommendation that the “passing shakes” in mm. 109–110 should be accented on the first note so that they sound “almost like semiquaver triplets” (243). His overall description of the sonata also provides a sharp contrast to Prescott’s and lacks her picturesque rhetoric. Reinecke explains that op. 7 “breathes more audibly of cheerfulness; gracefulness and liveliness are its principal attributes, and even in the short minor episode of the third and fourth movements the mood experiences no real gloom” ( Reinecke 1896b , 242–43).",

Macfarren had recently died in October 1887, so this article was not written by him, but by Prescott herself ( 1887c , 1028). (The differences between these two analyses will be examined in more detail in the next section of this article; here I focus specifically on the programmatic aspects of op. 7.) She describes how Macfarren explained that Beethoven’s dedication to Countess von Keglevics may have suggested a possible romantic relationship, but this interpretive detail is presented in The Musical World in a much more matter-of-fact tone, without the maudlin details of romance, lips, and roses in Prescott’s TGOP article: Beethoven’s admiration, at the time we are speaking of, was for the Countess Babette von Keglevics, and he found expression for his thoughts in the E flat sonata Op. 7. So much was it supposed by them to follow the course of his feelings, that his friends called it ‘Die Beliebte’—the beloved. To the same lady, when married, he dedicated another work.

The opening phrases are as the hero; you follow his adventures, and come across different persons, mark the successive points of his personal character, and bring his career to a happy close” ( 1887c , 1030). But Prescott’s article provides a different narrative description that invokes gendered themes associated with the private, domestic realm. She explains that the arrival of the recapitulation signals that “We are home again after long wanderings, and the old familiar story is to be told again” ( 1888 , 410). Her emphasis on home rather than career, on “we” rather than “he,” provides a striking contrast to the manly strivings articulated in Macfarren’s analysis.",

Or did Macfarren include tangents about romance and domesticity in his Cambridge and RAM lectures, but Prescott only chose to share those details in her own article for TGOP ? Given that Macfarren was an esteemed professor and his lectures about this piece occurred at two of the premier musical institutions of the day (one of which, Cambridge, excluded women), it seems more likely that the first interpretation is correct. (In addition, throughout the article Prescott is careful to use quotation marks for material that she felt she had accurately transcribed from Macfarren’s lectures, and parentheses for passages about which she was less certain. Both of these passages appear in quotation marks.

These columns also featured lavish illustrations of trendy dresses and accessories. Remarkably, many of these drawings fused fashion with music, often displaying women adorned in chic outfits at the piano. For example, an image of two fashionistas beside a piano appears in an 1886 installment of “Dress: In Season and in Reason” (shown in Example 8 ), and three of the seven installments of “The Dress of the Month” depict women in musical settings (two of these are provided in Examples 9 and 10 ).

We may think of this repeated and lengthened phrase as the coda , or tail-piece, of the movement; it is like the train of a lady’s Court dress, which gives dignity and grace to her whole appearance. ( 1891 , 443) Example 11 . “A Court Dress of 1897.” The Girl’s Own Paper (Lady Dressmaker 1897, 697) (click to enlarge) Court dresses in the Victorian era were elaborate formal costumes worn by women and girls when they were presented at court. The importance of a woman’s dress to this event cannot be overstated. As the author of an 1880 article explains, “the dress must be well made and all the details well carried out” ( Holt 1880 , 420). The author cautions that “every lady attending the Court must have a train, lappets, Court plumes, and a really low dress. So strict are the laws with regard to this, that people are appointed to prevent ladies passing who fall short in these requirements” (419). The author also advises that “the train must be at least three yards long, and is generally four” (419). Thus, a Court dress serves as a particularly apt metaphor for a coda, given the typical length of its train. (34) The illustration of a Court dress shown in Example 11 demonstrates the elaborate detail in the construction of these gowns, which also frequently incorporated flowers into their designs. (35)",

                "text": "[3.19] Prescott observes a similar level of intricacy and care in Mendelssohn’s piece. More than one-third of her article is devoted to the changes Mendelssohn makes in the return of the A section (mm. 21–35) and how these changes elevate the piece beyond mere triviality. Regarding the A’ section, Prescott writes, “A composer, who did not want to take much trouble about his music, might have copied out the strain from the beginning . . . added a couple of chords at the end, and sent off his music to the printer” ( 1891 , 443). Instead, Mendelssohn sets the return of the A section over a pedal bass, which gives it “a new colour” (443), and he expands and alters the consequent phrase (initially a four-bar consequent that ends with a PAC in m. 12). (36) Prescott notes how this phrase is “almost recomposed”; it not only contains material from the B section (mm. 17–18), but also leads to “a new form of the cadence” in m. 28 (what modern theorists would describe as an IAC) (443). Most importantly, the phrase is expanded in mm. 28–35, which contains “the repetition of this newly-formed phrase with yet another cadence, lengthened out for two bars more than before” (443). Prescott argues that this passage—which she describes as “a piece of delicate art”—is what makes op. 62, no. 4 distinctive. She writes, “That little extension, however, is a piece of delicate art—the art of a man who was skilled enough both to write large works and to put good workmanship into his smallest trifles” (443). For Prescott, so-called “domestic” works often relegated to the amateur female sphere (such as Mendelssohn’s Lieder ohne Worte ) can also contain structural aspects that blur the boundaries between “low” and “high” art, just as fashion and sewing (pursuits that were typically associated with women and the domestic sphere, and frequently denigrated as mere craft) can involve skill and artistry—as with the design and construction of a woman’s Court dress.

                "text": "[3.20] Prescott begins this article with a long explanation of rondo form, where she draws on a detailed metaphor involving an alderman’s collar (shown in Example 12 ) to describe the sections of a rondo and possibilities for different types of rondo forms: This rondo design is something after the fashion of an alderman’s collar, which is made of beautiful medallions joined together with links of gold. Between every two medallions there is one link; the link may be as beautiful as you please, but the medallion is the chief, the principal subject. If you please, also, you may take off two medallions with their connecting link and make an ornament for the dress of the alderman’s little daughter, if he is so fortunate to have one; this is the rondo with one episode; or you may take off three medallions with their two links, or four with three links; each group will be complete as an ornament, and like different kinds of rondo . ( 1891 , 443) Prescott’s discussion of the alderman’s collar is particularly noteworthy for the way in which it subtly subverts traditional patriarchal structures. An alderman’s collar (also known as a chain of office or livery collar) is worn by British government officials as an indication of their rank and status; particular chains of office are often associated with specific positions. (For example, the chain of office for the Lord Mayor of London, shown in Example 12, is still in use today. (38) ) Prescott quite literally dismantles the alderman’s collar in this passage, not just describing how it might be reconfigured to represent different types of rondo forms, but even how it could be disassembled in order to make a decoration for the dress of the official’s “little daughter.” Here she makes her analytic ideas about various types of rondo form more accessible to her readers through metaphor, by undoing the alderman’s collar and placing it on the dress of a young girl. But in a broader sense, one might also read Prescott’s description of the alderman’s collar as an attempt to demystify topics typically associated with the masculine sphere in the Victorian era (composition, analysis, formal structure) by aligning her structural discussion of rondos specifically with the “little daughters” who were reading her article.

Her discussions of voice leading are significant because music articles in TGOP did not typically have this level of musical specificity (indeed, no other articles in TGOP that I have encountered contain detailed voice leading rules). For example, Prescott explains the characteristic upwards resolution of the chordal seventh in the common progression I– V –I 6 . She cites mm. 59–63 of the first movement of Beethoven’s op. 7 piano sonata as “an example of the resolution of the dominant seventh upwards . . . In this case the seventh, instead of its usual fall to the next chord, may rise; and it does so here with very pleasant effect” ( 1888 , 411) ( Example 13 ). (40) Prescott also highlights Beethoven’s “strict preparation” of chordal sevenths a few measures later: “there is a diatonic prepared seventh of G (G in bass), resolved on the chord of C. This C chord is the dominant, with its seventh, of F, and makes a transient modulation into that key. The seventh is strictly prepared, as befits even the dominant seventh when used in company with other prepared discords” (411) ( Example 14 ). For Prescott, a “transient modulation” seems to be a fleeting harmonic departure that doesn’t fully disrupt the prevailing key of a passage (what modern theorists would call a tonicization)—in this example, the brief I 6 –ii 7 –V 7 –I progression in F major in mm. 65–67. (41) But her larger point here is that Beethoven’s “strict preparation” of chordal sevenths may be found in both of the seventh chords that create the brief tonicization of the dominant of B ♭ .",

She analyzes diminished seventh chords in two ways: both use a similar explanation for the chord’s basic structure and origin, but involve slightly different surface-level interpretations, depending on how the chord resolves.

Macfarren and Day were good friends; Macfarren noted that their friendship “sprang into closest intimacy” when Day started to share his “novel principles” of music theory with him ( Day [1845] 1855 , x). Macfarren edited and revised the second edition of Day’s treatise (published posthumously in 1885), and he also wrote a lengthy appendix to the second edition ( Day [1845] 1855 , 189–223).

Their “fundamental” chromatic chords originate from the tonic, dominant, and supertonic scale degrees, and they invoked the overtone series to justify why these particular pitches should be “chosen as roots” ( Day [1845] 1855 , 60). They argued that the fifth of the generating note, or third partial, is the first new pitch in the harmonic series; the supertonic is the fifth (or third partial) of that fifth, and “the first harmonic that is common to both, it being the fifth of the dominant, and the major ninth of the tonic” (62). (48) The tonic, dominant, and supertonic scale degrees were then used to generate “fundamental” chromatic chords of the seventh, ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth, each of which may be constructed on one of the three primary “roots.” (49) Critics of Day and Macfarren pointed out the inconsistencies in their use of the harmonic series (Why is the supertonic selected as a “root” when it occurs so late in the harmonic series of the tonic fundamental?), and the numerous problems of intonation in their chordal derivations (to give just one example, the sevenths of the tonic, dominant, and supertonic fundamental chromatic chords would be too flat if derived from an overtone series on each of these pitches).

For example, Lady Benedict considers performance issues such as dynamics, fingering, and phrasing in her series of articles on Beethoven’s piano sonatas; her descriptions of individual sonatas are notably brief (a few short sentences for each movement).

In her groundbreaking work on nineteenth-century women’s periodicals, Beetham explains that “femininity is always represented in [women’s] magazines as fractured, not least because it is simultaneously assumed as given and as still to be achieved . . . [T]his femininity has been addressed in and through a form which is itself fractured and heterogenous” ( 1996 , 1). At first glance, TGOP might seem to be entirely conservative in orientation because of its frequent emphasis on morality and “proper” womanhood, and because it was published by the Religious Tract Society. (56) However, like other profitable and successful magazines of its time, TGOP actually included a range of articles and perspectives that sometimes expressed dramatically different viewpoints. Skelding highlights how TGOP “seems to have steered an uneasy course between two extremes” ( 2001 , 36), and notes the TGOP ’s “frequently baffling tendency to project apparently divergent, or contradictory, notions of femininity; combing the radical with the domestic and reactionary” (35). She stresses that TGOP “does not project one view of women but many views” (51). Example 22 . “The Dream of Home.” The Girl’s Own Paper (1889, 664) (click to enlarge)",

Her analysis of Beethoven’s op. 7 sonata is preceded by an article entitled “Wedding Anniversaries” that describes the custom of giving gifts to symbolize certain anniversaries (for example, silver for a twenty-fifth anniversary) ( Dyer 1888 , 407). Her op. 7 article is followed by another article with a domestic focus, which explains how to make different homemade crafts out of wood sticks to entertain children ( “How to Amuse Children” 1888 , 412). The most striking juxtaposition involves Prescott’s analysis of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in D major, op. 28. Sandwiched between the second and third pages of the article is the full-page image shown in Example 22 , entitled “The Dream of Home,” which depicts a demure young woman plucking what appears to be a dital harp, a Victorian parlor instrument. (57) The music notation at the top of the illustration does not reference the Beethoven sonata Prescott discusses, but instead shows a rudimentary progression of tonic and dominant seventh chords in C major. The conservative content found within and around Prescott’s articles thus seems an attempt to mitigate the more advanced topics she presents, diluting the theoretical content in her articles with material that extolls the virtues of traditional womanhood. These juxtapositions reflect the magazine’s broader editorial vision; Barger explains that in TGOP “the musically accomplished young lady was expected to live her life so that she did not lose as an ideally feminine woman what she gained in proficiency as a musician” ( 2016 , 3).",

For example, the same March 1888 issue discussed above (which includes Prescott’s op. 7 analysis, surrounded by the articles on “Wedding Anniversaries” and “How to Amuse Children”), also contains a lengthy article entitled “Odd Characters: A Gallery of Eccentric Women,” which describes the relationship between Eleanor Butler (1739–1829) and Sarah Ponsonby (1755–1831). Colloquially known as “the ladies of Llangollen,” Butler and Ponsonby were a lesbian couple who lived together for approximately 50 years in a Welsh cottage. The article describes how the two women decided “to fly from the world, and seek some secluded spot where they could live entirely for each other” ( N. Mason 1888 , 402). (58) The articles that appear before and after Prescott’s op. 49, no. 1 analysis also encapsulate the fractures commonly found within TGOP . Prescott’s analysis (which features the gendered metaphor about dressmaking and the diminished seventh chord discussed above) is preceded by an installment of the regular column “Dress: In Season and In Reason” by the Lady Dressmaker, which describes several recent fashion trends. (59) But the selection that follows Prescott’s analysis is more forward-looking. “Such a Coward!,” the final installment of a four-part short story, chronicles how the courageous Céline dramatically rescues her cousins—including her arrogant and outspoken male cousin, Alfie—from a wild bull they encounter while picnicking in the country. In contrast to Alfie, who selfishly leaves his cousins behind and runs to safety as he “trembled with haste and fear,” Céline remains calm and fends off the furious bull by distracting him with a cloth ( “Such a Coward” 1887 , 556). Alfie praises Céline’s bravery at the end of the story, confessing, “I couldn’t have believed I could have been such a coward . . . as to leave the girls and Emmie [his younger sister] to manage for themselves when I was the only man of the party, and ought to have protected them. I think I just lost my head with fright” (557). Thus, the theoretical detail in Prescott’s writings did depart from the usual musical content in TGOP , but it was entirely in keeping with the heterogeneous scope of the magazine. Although TGOP was certainly not a radical feminist magazine, its diverse content reflects the broader trends of women’s magazines of the era, which contained fractures and incongruities that pushed the boundaries of traditional womanhood. As Skelding argues, the articles in TGOP serve as an “on-going debate”; ultimately TGOP provided “a forum for the discussion of contemporary issues affecting young women and girls . . . [I]ts pages were used as a medium to wage contemporary debates about the woman’s place in society” ( 2001 , 50).",

To cite another example, a lengthy article published in The Musical Standard , in which Ernst Pauer examines Beethoven’s piano sonatas in E-flat major (op. 7), C-sharp minor (op. 27, no. 2), and C major (op. 53), also lacks the theoretical intricacies of Prescott’s analyses. (60) His discussion of the first movement of op. 7 is limited to a single paragraph that does not include any in-depth information on voice leading, harmony, or form. Like Reinecke and Lady Benedict, his analytic observations consist of whimsical yet vague generalities; he characterizes the first movement as “grand, bold, manly; yet at times it is relieved by passages of great smoothness and tenderness, and shows Beethoven’s anxiety to exhibit sufficient contrasts” ( 1882 , 367).

In 1886 Ernst von Elterlein’s Beethoven’s Pianoforte Sonatas (an English translation of a German text first published in 1856) was published in England. The preface explains how Elterlein’s book “stands forth as an honourable exception amidst the host of insipid commentaries on the great master’s works—the multitudinous explanations that explain nothing” ( [1856] 1886 , vi). (62) Thus “every musical student or amateur can safely trust him [Elterlein] as a competent and agreeable guide” (vii). However, Elterlein’s descriptions of individual sonata movements are of similar length as Reinecke’s and Lady Benedict’s (a paragraph or less), and are notably nebulous. For example, his entire discussion of the second movement of Beethoven’s op. 28 sonata (the same movement analyzed in Prescott 1889 ) consists of the following sentence: “The second movement, andante , D minor, 3/4 time, produces a feeling like that which comes over us when light films of cloud veil the sun, making a beautiful landscape shine in fallow light, the cloud only breaking a little now and then to admit the kindly sunbeams” (69). Elterlein’s lush descriptions of Beethoven’s piano sonatas were harshly ridiculed by Reinecke, who dismissed Elterlein’s work as “poetical commentaries,” arguing that it is “superfluous to increase the number of this mode of explanation, especially as it always remains doubtful whether the true comprehension of these masterpieces is really helped thereby” ( 1896a , 147). Elterlein’s accounts, while also geared towards an amateur audience, thus lack the details of performance practice found in Reinecke’s and Lady Benedict’s writings, but they also lack the theoretical detail found in Prescott’s articles, and they do not include the explicitly gendered metaphors she uses in her articles for TGOP .",

(For the sake of clarity, in the following paragraphs I refer to The Musical World article as Macfarren’s since it presents his analysis, even though it was compiled by Prescott.) Prescott’s analysis of op. 7 for TGOP is actually more theoretically rich than Macfarren’s. Both Macfarren’s and Prescott’s articles provide a basic overview of the form of the movement, and the two articles also share several music examples that identify the main themes of the movement. (63) However, Prescott’s article is approximately twice as long as Macfarren’s, and the balance of content also differs between the two articles. Of Macfarren’s twenty-two short paragraphs, thirteen present basic background information about Beethoven and the sonata and explain Prescott’s involvement in writing the article; only nine brief paragraphs in Macfarren’s article provide any theoretical observations about the movement.

Banister ( 1891 ) emphasizes Prescott’s integral role in the creation of Macfarren’s 1883 oratorio King David , because she helped him select texts. When Macfarren expressed his uncertainty about setting a particular passage of text, Prescott composed her own setting to demonstrate how it could work well. After Macfarren heard Prescott’s composition, he exclaimed that he now had “a greater difficulty before me” because he had to create something “different to yours” ( Banister 1891 , 308).",

However, Prescott stresses that she has thought carefully about the piece and created something original in its own right, which has new insights not found in Macfarren’s analysis: The tables are now turned upon the pupil; she wishes to write an analysis of a certain sonata, and there lie on the desk before her her own notes of a lecture given by her master on the very same sonata. Yes, there is the groundwork of what I must say in those notes, but how am I to say that which shall be my own? Shall I make it my own by saying that I have proved the truth of all the analysis by experiment, and that I have added much that was not said by him? ( 1888 , 408) Prescott also concludes her article by differentiating her analysis from Macfarren’s one final time. Her last sentence states, “if any readers wish to see for themselves what the old professor really said on this sonata, let them refer to the Musical World for December 31, 1887, where they will find gems of his thought, set by these clumsy but affectionate hands” (412).",

As Moruzi emphasizes, “The tensions between the ideal of female domesticity and the new realities of women’s lives are reflected in girls’ magazines of the period and demonstrate how difficult it can be to reconcile these opposing forces” ( 2012 , 12). Prescott’s choice to include in-depth theoretical content in a general-interest periodical for women also creates a complicated picture of the musical level and abilities of her readers: her concise, straightforward mode of presentation seems to indicate that she believed her (amateur, female) readers were fully capable of understanding more advanced theoretical topics such as chromatic harmony. Somewhat ironically, her articles for TGOP might well represent the most detailed and nuanced discussion of these pieces in English for a Victorian audience, and reveal that music theorizing can and did happen in other places outside of published tomes or specialty periodicals for musicians.

(66) Prescott also uses a string of references to “we” and “us” in a different article (“Touching the Pianoforte”) to emphasize how pianists should cultivate an expressive, individualistic tone to maximize the emotional impact of their performances: “That is, after all, the reason we love the piano. For we, who cannot sing our beautiful thoughts, or speak them like the orator, or write them like the poet and the novelist, we want something else by which we can tell those around us of the love and beauty that are about us all . . .

She writes that analysis should not create Fright or terror for you . . . you need not be afraid to try. I have heard so many little girls—aye, and big ones too—say, “Oh, it’s too difficult for me to understand music”; but so long as you have love for music, and patience to dwell upon it, its meaning will unfold to you. Have you not seen the flower-bud seem to open and smile upon your baby-sister, while your mother holds her to the pretty thing? Just so will music unfold and smile upon you as you dwell upon its beauties. (67) ( 1889 , 663) This remarkable passage is noteworthy not just because it encourages women to learn more about theory and analysis, but because of the gendered rhetoric that Prescott employs—her saccharine metaphors invoke stereotypically feminine imagery that includes love, patience, flowers, beauty, motherhood, and even a baby sister. Prescott is really a master of journalistic economy here, not just churning out an abundant ooze of femininity in a few short sentences, but exploiting that same feminine imagery to argue her point about analysis and women, just as she did with the gendered metaphors related to theoretical topics discussed in the previous sections of this article.",

Prescott was personally invested in women’s education, as she worked as a music teacher at the Church of England High School for Girls in London, and taught correspondence classes in harmony, counterpoint, and composition for Newnham College (the second Cambridge-affiliated women’s college, founded in 1871). Fuller emphasizes the significance of Prescott’s position at Newnham, even though it was just for correspondence courses, explaining that Prescott was “one of the few women of her generation to work in music at a British university” ( 2018 , 156). It is obviously impossible to know Prescott’s exact opinion regarding the changing status of women in the late nineteenth century, but aside from her own experiences educating young women, she also wrote at least two articles that reveal how her desire for women to learn more about the basic structures of music may have dovetailed with her views of contemporaneous debates about women’s work.",

Stratton presented a paper on “Woman in Relation to Musical Art” before the Musical Association (the same academic organization previously discussed, in which Prescott was a charter member and active participant). Stratton attempted to account for the lack of “great” women composers by describing the institutional barriers women traditionally faced—in particular, lack of access to professional education. He argued that with better educational opportunities, more women composers—and better women composers—would emerge, and he included a list of several hundred women composers from 1500 to the present in a lengthy appendix to his essay (139–146). (69) During the question-and-answer session following Stratton’s paper, Ferdinand Praeger vehemently disagreed with Stratton by invoking separate spheres ideologies, citing women’s supposed intellectual weakness and their “natural” association with stereotypically feminine realms such as emotion and feeling. (70) Praeger claimed that “woman is incapable of great composition” ( Stratton 1883 , 136) because “woman’s brain is not capable. She has not the reasoning power, nor has she the intensity . . . [She] lacks the reasoning power to go step by step, which is one of the most important items in composition” (135). Praeger stresses that woman’s “genius” is that of instinct, not reason: Woman is gifted beyond man with a genius—I say genius advisedly—that we cannot understand—her marvelous power of instinct . . . Men can give reason, they give details, they go step by step to prove that such and such a thing must occur, but woman has direct genius , she has instinct, and does a thing because she feels [emphasis Praeger’s]. Ask her for reasons and she will refuse them because she cannot give them . . . you will never do any good in point of reasoning, if you reason with her ever so long; it will be no good; she cannot follow it.” (134) In Praeger’s view, the paucity of women composers resulted from women’s inherent lack of ability for reasoned, logical thought.",

                "text": "[5.6] Prescott did not respond to Praeger during the question-and-answer session (indeed, no women participated in the discussion following Stratton’s paper), but she wrote a lengthy rebuttal to Praeger’s comments that was published in The Musical World , entitled “Is Reason or Instinct the Best Composer?” ( 1883 ). She begins by describing a dream she had after hearing Praeger’s remarks, in which two male musicians, “Reason” and “Instinct,” attempt to create a composition. After quarreling about whose approach is best, Reason and Instinct eventually realize that composition should be a collaborative process that fuses both of their perspectives, and so “they shook hands and went to work together” (366). (71) At the end of the article, she annihilates Praeger’s position by humorously pointing out the flaws in his supposedly “logical” reasoning: “he also forgot that he was jumping to the conclusion that women cannot reason. The frightened child at night puts his head under the bed-clothes and thinks he is safe because he cannot hear the noise. This is all very well when the child is frightened at nothing; but if there is a real burglar or fire the bed-clothes will not save him” (366; italics in the original). Prescott concludes, “there are two kinds of reasoning, one by deduction , the other by induction ”; although induction is “more natural to women,” they can (and should) use both modes of thought (366; italics in the original). She writes that women “do not often take the trouble to prove in argument what they already know . . . But they can if they try” (366)—just as she did in her article.",

                "text": "[5.7] But Prescott’s ideas about women’s work also extended beyond the musical realm. In 1894 she wrote an article for The Musical News (a popular British periodical for both men and women) that described an upcoming “Imperial Exhibition of Women’s Work,” which would showcase women’s contributions in a broad range of different fields. Prescott argued that the exhibition would help dispel long-held gendered stereotypes regarding man’s supposed “power” and woman’s innate “weakness”: For the workers among the weaker sex have to contend against two deeply-rooted ideas. One of these is a distortion of the song “Men must work and women must weep.” Kingsley never meant in that refrain to claim the monopoly of either privilege for either sex. Yet that is the common idea, as untrue as it is unfair to both sexes. The other deeply-rooted idea is that women’s work is weak. What a blessed word is that word weak ! How it is applied here, there, and everywhere to express dissatisfaction of any sort, just as its opposite, powerful , is applied everywhere and to everything to express approval! . . . I suppose women’s work was very bad at one time, in the days when a blue-stocking was a dreadful person in grotesque attire, when paper flowers and wax grapes were the expression of domestic fine art, and “Avison’s beautiful air” with variations for three performers on one pianoforte the joy of the musical amateur. Still, even in those times, the women did but “match the men” . . . for men in those days had no time for anything good but fighting. They did that thoroughly. In all the years since then, however, our work has been getting better. It is to show that women’s work can improve, for it has improved, that it can be good, for it is good, and make it yet better, and yet easier, that this exhibition has been planned.

Her articles demonstrate that her commitment to women’s education was not perfunctory, but serious and enduring. Her writings for TGOP represent just one small part of her many contributions as a music theorist. But when viewed alongside her other pedagogical work with women and her writing about women’s education, these articles reflect some of the major tensions of the late nineteenth century regarding the changing status of women and improving women’s education. In an 1890 article for The Musical World , written in the midst of her work for TGOP , Prescott mused, “My own little life of music is a very quiet one; chiefly comprised within the walls of my study, from whence I look out as from a watch tower upon the struggles, the sorrows, hopes, and joys of my fellows, having those of my own which they perhaps have little knowledge of” ( 1890 , 66). Perhaps Prescott hoped that her work as a public music theorist would not just educate the next generation of women and enrich their musical experiences, but also help to eradicate the loneliness and isolation experienced by many professional women of Prescott’s generation.

When I first encountered her writings in TGOP , I initially dismissed them: the articles were short, her colorful language struck me as unscholarly, and the theoretical content seemed straightforward and primarily pedagogical. Why should anyone be interested in Prescott’s work, especially given our rich trove of nineteenth-century music theory treatises? But I eventually realized that my own scholarly biases were prohibiting me from appreciating how these articles offer something unique and distinctive. As Thomas Christensen has argued, too often theorists focus solely on the “elite texts” of music theory; broadening our perspective to include other genres and venues in which music theory can and does take place “allows us to see music theory as a living, engaging, and ultimately human pursuit” ( 2011 , 201).",

Sir Donald Francis Tovey is often considered the first British public music intellectual, but Tovey was actually preceded by a vibrant and longstanding tradition of public music scholarship in Britain, which included theorists such as Prescott. (72) Her work demonstrates how journalism served as a vital public platform for sharing music theory among British women in the late nineteenth century, and it complicates the stereotype of the ignorant amateur female musician. Furthermore, if we prematurely dismiss work like Prescott’s for being “superficial” or “weak,” we run the risk of replicating the very same binary oppositions of “powerful” and “weak” that Prescott herself argued against more than a century ago. Sometimes music theory can be discovered in the most unexpected settings, but I think that tells us something about the value of what we do as music theorists. We can find music theory happening in all sorts of extraordinary places, if we take the time to look—and if we dare to read with an open mind.",
