John \nCovach writes that “There are a number of other kinds of \nmusic . . . for which the idea of a musical &lquowork’ does not apply” \n(paragraph 20). Indeed, we should be looking to such musics for \nexamples of a musical world prior to the Work; the music of \nIndia, which is entirely improvised, might serve as an \nexample. It is predicated upon a series of complex combinatory \nrules (the talas and ragas and their permutations) which \nin turn serve to illuminate the pure, cosmic resonance (the \nOM). This tradition actually enshrines the opposite kind of \nmovement from that of Western Classicism; its conventions \nserve to draw the performance into the musical world, the \nontological condition of possibility for music, the non-musical, \nthe pure vibration. Indian musical practice, one might even \nsay, is more authentic than that of the West. It certainly has its \nown share of being-towards-death. (2)",

We \nshould also take note of Heidegger’s example of the actor in \nthe No drama who, with a single gesture on an empty stage, \nbrings forth a world. The stage is empty—the metaphor must \nnot be taken to mean that the musical world fills the stage with \npast musical experiences. The musical world is the stage, \nthe performance space, the ideal 4’33” which forms the \nnecessary context for musical experience. This experience, \nthen, is like the gesture of the actor.

On my reading, which is admittedly \nthoroughgoingly Heideggerian, the musical world cannot be \nprecisely as it is described here since, if it were, the condition \nof possibility for works would simply be other works, which \nleads to an ontological infinite regress and a hermeneutic \ncircularity.",

It is \ncertainly constituted from musical experiences (what else \ncould constitute it?), yet it does not contain works of music. It \nis, rather, a space created by experiences of music, \nengagements with music as “equipment”, as environment. \nThus, it is an aesthetic space. These experiences cannot be \ndifferentiated—again, we are speaking of a space, not its \ncontents, and the musical world is not a taxonomy of previous \nexperiences, which may be recalled individually at will. They \ninstead conbine to form a space or stage in which other \nmusical experiences may “take place”.",

There is something like a dialectic \n(although not in the Hegelian sense) at work between the space \nand its contents, and this dialectic takes the form of the \nontological difference. This much is clear. Yet this difference \nis also a deferral (4) or referral which captures both the space \nand its object in a process of change. As the space effects the \nobject (radically; the space enables the object to be what it is), \nso the object effects the space. For what cannot be objectified \nin the experience of the piece of music itself goes to mutate the \nspace, the musical world itself. That which can be objectified \nwill be removed from musical experience altogether, and \npassed into a different mode of thought,such as the \nmathematical, cultural or historical.",

The purely \nsubjective-experiential space is infolded within the musical \nwork; it is its secret, what Adorno would call its “enigma”, the \nkernal of non-music within music, which makes that music \npossible. (5) Perhaps this is one way in which we could escape \nthe solipsism which threatens this project. While the musical \nworld is experiential, it is also in the realm of ideas, and these \nideas may be (are necessarily?) ideological. Thus we get to \nAdorno via Heidegger, in spite of Adorno’s protestations to the \ncontrary. That contradictory kernel could easily be seen quite \nsimply as the contradiction which, in the course of negative \ndialectics, comes to be a negative kind of truth, an escape from \nideology which is wholly negative.
