    "abstract": "This article derives from a speech at the 2019 forum to commemorate the 120th anniversary of Professor Yáng Yīnliú’s birth. It contains two large sections. The first section is a brief report of how, since the beginning of the 21st century, the author has introduced modern linguistics and other non-conventional methods for notation and analysis, taking the analysis of the sounds of chàngcí 唱詞 as the starting point for research, and contributing to the systematic construction of the cross-cutting discipline “linguistics of music” in music institutions. The section also introduces the newly published monographExploring Regional Charms Beyond Musical Notes: Analysis of the Sounds of chàngcí(2020), the textbookFoundation of the Linguistics of Music(2018), and the research project “Yuèshuō 樂說 in Chinese Vocal Music” for “Unpopular and Esoteric Projects,” supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (2019). The second section of the article further argues for the need for linguistics of music from three perspectives: the protection and inheritance of intangible cultural heritage, thick description of regional music, and music composition with Chinese elements. The article discusses not only the sounds of words as music but also the issue of phonetic notation in musical scores.PEER REVIEWER: Jacob Reed",

I worked for several newspapers and magazines on the editorial staff for eleven years before I became a graduate student majoring in musicology on traditional music in China, when I was thirty-eight. I have continued to study and work in this field since then. Although I did not get a chance to listen to Professor Yáng Yīnliú’s 楊蔭瀏 lectures, I benefited very much from reading Professor Yang’s books and articles on traditional music in China.

The more I studied, the more I realized that the relationship between music and language is a non-negligible object of study. Working on traditional Chinese music year after year had motivated me to develop the field of “linguistics of music”—the cross-cutting discipline concerned with language and music. (4) I realized that this would be an enormous project, a focus deserving of my lifelong commitment. I have seen clearly that in order to establish linguistics of music in music institutions, it is urgently needed to build a systematic structure of the discipline’s concepts, fundamental theory, and teaching-research practices. Therefore, since the beginning of the 21st century, I have started to focus my career on this field. As I systematically studied the related theory of linguistics, I have been working to establish a fundamental theory of linguistics of music and to conduct case studies in this discipline (with several such articles published). In 2008, after these preparations, I started teaching the elective course “Foundations of Linguistics of Music” at the Conservatory.",

Naming and Positioning of the Discipline [1.3] Since this discipline is still budding, its namings in relevant articles are not unified, and its positioning in the entire field of music study is neither mature nor clear. Therefore, there is still room to explore the naming and positioning of the discipline. (1) On the Naming of the Discipline [1.4] Both Professor Yáng Yīnliú and Professor Zhāng Míng 張鳴used “語言音樂學” (Linguistic Musicology) as the discipline’s name. Meanwhile, I used “民族語言音樂學” (Ethnolinguistic Musicology) in one of my articles, based on the following considerations. Firstly, the name Ethnolinguistic Musicology is prefixed by “ethno,” which is intended to emphasize the multi-ethnic aspect within vocal musics of multi-ethnic native languages. Secondly, referring to the English version of the discipline as Ethnolinguistic Musicology was approved by Professor Pǔ Shí 蒲實, the expert on music literature. It is consistent with the content and usage of “Ethnomusicology,” as both terms use the prefix “ethno” (anthropological) to emphasize musical cultures of diverse mother tongues, and the subordinate relationship of the former (anthropology) to the latter (musicology).",

                "text": "[1.5] Later, I switched to using “linguistics of music” (音樂語言學) for two reasons. First, the Chinese term “民族” (ethnic) has a certain degree of ambiguity. It might be misunderstood as indicating that the object of study is limited only to vocal musics of ethnic groups in China if the prefix “ethno” is added to the name. In reality, the subject matter of this discipline transcends these bounds. Secondly, according to some scholars, methodology should be at the root of the names of cross-cutting disciplines. In this case, the discipline’s main research method is linguistics, and its object of study is music. Therefore, I followed the English and Chinese naming used in Mr. Alan Merriam’s Anthropology of Music ( 1964 ): “linguistics of music” in English, and “音樂語言學” in Chinese.",

The Chinese name of the discipline extends the idioms of our predecessors, namely “語言音樂學” (Linguistic Musicology), whereas the English name uses “linguistics of music,” intending to be associated with the model of “anthropology of music” when communicating overseas. (2) The Positioning of the Discipline [1.7] I position linguistics of music as both a branch of ethnomusicology and of linguistics. It is a systematic, cross-cutting discipline with regional musics as its main research objects. It combines modern linguistic methods (including phonetic, analytical, and speculative methods, as well as various non-conventional methods for notation and analysis, mainly those of digital science and technology) with musicological methods (normally based on study of musical notes).",

In actuality, the textual signs used in chàngcí already have a certain complexity outside of music works. As long as one is not deaf or mute, human acquisition of words always includes two conditions—the semantic and phonetic. When words enter vocal music to become chàngcí, they not only bring their meanings of the words, but also the sounds of the words when pronounced. More importantly, when words become part of vocal music, these sounds (which I call the sounds of chàngcí) are musical. When viewed as artistic signs, chàngcí cannot be the carrier of a single sign. The semantics conveyed by characters of chàngcí is literary, while the sonic part of chàngcí—including timbre, tone, formal beauty, and many other aspects of words—belong to the musical sign, as they are directly or indirectly involved in the composition of auditory beauty in vocal works.",

Therefore, linguistics of music should certainly be qualified to exist in music institutions, and to belong within the purview of musicians. Ⅲ. The Musical Value of the Sounds of chàngcí themselves and the “Dual Six Key Points” [1.14] Another cognitive misconception in music studies is that in the past, chàngcí was only discussed as having mere “influence” on music. Our Sino-Tibetan language family is a tonal language, and the fluctuation of the tone of speech inevitably affects the generation of chàngqiāng 唱腔 (vocal melodies of any genre). Of course, this aspect of the relationship between chàngcí and chàngqiāng is most easily captured. However, if further questioned, does chàngcí only have an “influence” on vocal musics?",

The consistency of the overall trend indicates that the tone of the chàngcí has a significant impact on the melody, demonstrating the implicit influence of the tone of the chàngcí on the chàngqiāng. The reason why it is called “implicit&rdqduo is because this influence is not precise and is only an approximation. The sounds of chàngcí that have value as implicit musical signs must first have an explicit value (their own sound form), meaning that implicit musical signs must have two types of musical value ( Example 2 ).

The Five Aspects of Core Cognition of Non-Conventional Methods for Notation and Analysis [1.21] There is another deep reason for linguistics of music being marginalized in musical circles. Being influenced by the existing institutional education, musicians have been taking the methods of analyzing musical notes as the mainstream of music analysis and ignoring the relationship between vocal musics and language. Mainstream research has furthermore ignored the sheer regional diversity of these entangled vocal musics and languages. Taking again the perspective of regional vocal music research, I have proposed that there are at least five aspects to this research. Within these aspects, the function of non-conventional methods for notation and analysis (methods from linguistics of music) should be no less significant than conventional methods for musical signs. Instead, both should become core epistemological practices.",

Promoting “Shuāngyīn Vocal Notation 雙音唱譜” [1.23] In conventional vocal notation, notes are symbols indicating the pitches of the chàngqiāng, while the chàngcí (in non-phonetic script) indicate semantics only. I know that in the vocal musical practice of some western countries, when singing songs of different languages, there are international phonetic symbols below the notes on the score. I refer to this type of score as “shuāngyīn Vocal Notation 雙音唱譜 (Double-Tone Notation),” which includes both musical notes and words plus IPA.",

Thereafter, it has been constantly revised and refined by the International Phonetic Association for more than a hundred years. Nowadays, it is commonly accepted as the most scientific symbolic system for recording speech to date, and has become the foundational and iconic system of modern phonetics. Therefore, using shuāngyīn Vocal Notation not only allows the sounds of chàngcí to be notated for non-phonetic scripts, but also puts both the chàngqīang and the chàngcí in the form of a universally recognized symbolic system. Thus, to conduct “sonic analysis of chàngcí,” I advocate the use of shuāngyīn Vocal Notation.",

In my opinion, a person in contemporary society should neither worship foreign dominant cultures, nor absolutely reject foreign cultures and keep them outside the country. “Localization” was originally proposed as a slogan aimed to fight against the blind use of foreign culture and to advocate for the preservation of one’s own cultural characteristics. Foreign cultural products are not conducive to this goal, so we should naturally put them in an appropriate position to avoid their excessive impact on and replacement of local cultural characteristics. On the other hand, when a foreign cultural product is conducive to the preservation of our local multi-cultural characteristics, why not put the foreign concept into practice? Ⅵ. The Research on “yuèshuō 樂說” [1.26] “Yuèshuō 樂說” (literally “musical speech”) refers to speaking within traditional Chinese vocal musics. In order to distinguish yuèshuō from the word “shuō說” (literally, “speech,” the linguistic term used to describe language communication behavior), and also to emphasize its musical properties, we call it yuèshuō. This concept covers all vocal sounds that differ from strict “singing” due to being recitative in style, such as various “shūo 說,” “bái 白,” “sòng 誦,” “yīng 吟” and other speaking sounds (which staff notation cannot accurately label) in vocal passages. In my opinion, yuèshuō and “singing” should be on equal footing in vocal musics. Yuèshuō is another form of musical expression.",

As a result, I have grown conscientious of the multi-faceted demands that music studies places upon the linguistics of music. At the least, those demands include the following three: Ⅰ. The Need for the Protection and Inheritance of Intangible Cultural Heritage [2.2] UNESCO launched the “Protection and Inheritance of Intangible Cultural Heritage” project at the beginning of the 21st century. Its goal is to protect the intangible cultures of all people groups in order to maintain the multicultural landscape of humanity. The focus of the “Protection and Inheritance of Intangible Cultural Heritage” project in the field of music is, of course, the maintenance of the characteristics of various ethnic groups and various regional music cultures. One of the most prominent features of traditional Chinese music is regionalism, which refers to the use of native chàngcí (local dialects or ethnic languages) in ethnic and regional singing genres. In other words, the native chàngcí in these indigenous singing genres undoubtedly carry a rich regional vocal gene. Whether we can fully record their true phonetic morphology will inevitably affect the effectiveness of preservation and inheritance.",

To record the pitch information of tunes, musical notes can certainly be used, but the sound patterns of native chàngcí often cannot be marked by musical notes alone. Even pinyin , the Chinese phonetic writing system, cannot fully capture those sounds. This is because pinyin was developed to promote Mandarin, and the phonemes of Mandarin are limited. The number of symbols in pinyin is correspondingly limited and cannot cover the phonemes of all topolects and regions. Although some ethnic groups’ native phonetic symbols do duly represent the chàngcí within their own ethnic groups, these notation systems are not universally recognized. This is bound to be detrimental to the project of cultural transmission, especially given the international capacity at which music institutions operate, where students may be from all over the world.",

Ⅱ. The Need for “Thick Description” of Regional Music [2.5] At the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, ethnomusicology from abroad introduced into musicological circles in mainland China a trend towards writing “thick description” of music as culture. This was originally a good thing and improved musicological research. However, some musicology articles lacked internal connection between music analysis and thick description, and was criticized by some scholars as “liǎngzhāngpí 两张皮 (literally, “having two skins”).",

They not only collected the tunes of traditional musics, but also went beyond the auditory realm to draw on images of mountains, rivers, lakes, seas and other geographic landscapes, thereby producing many multidimensional works of “Chinese elements.” Yet this kind of creative scale is often more suitable for large-form musical works. Given my perspective in linguistics of music, I pay more attention to creative groups who excavate “Chinese elements” by producing musical works with regional elements based on topolects. The strongest advantage of this type of work is the harmony they achieve between chàngqiāng and chàngcí. Guangdong Province is a prominent site of this kind of creative tradition, where Cantonese songs and Chao Yu songs (the languages in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas of Guangdong Province belong to the southern Min dialect) have existed for a long time. Musicians in Shanghai have also recently begun introducing songs in Shanghainese.",
