Each paragraph let me to raise my eyebrows and say, “Yes, but what\nabout . . . ?,” only to find that the but-what-about was covered in the\nfollowing paragraph!  It would have been nice had Justin not led us down\nquite so many garden paths in order to make his point, but perhaps I just\nhappen to feel that way because I am in the thick of this stuff right now.",

It’s a pretty heavy stone, though:  But\nwhat about the fact that there is already a researcher who has worked out\na potentially interesting quantitative model which not only accounts for\nthe dynamic nature of meter but may even provide a viable quantification\nof just how loud some of those rests are?  The research in question is named\nPeter Desain, and I want to address his work because I have been hard a work\nreviewing a recent book, Music, Mind and Machine:  Studies in Computer Music,\nMusic Cognition and Artificial Intelligence , which Desain wrote with his\ncolleague Henkjan Honing.",

It was actually introduced to\ncomparatively evaluate systems concerned with the detection of metric beat in\nperformances of music.  For example, given a timetable of MIDI events from a\nkeyboard performance, the system being evaluated should be capable to\ntranslating the real-time durations of events into the discrete symbols\nof music notation.  An algorithm to solve this problem was first proposed\nby Christopher Longuet-Higgins in the Seventies, and Desain wanted to compare\nthe performance of this algorithm with a system of his own design based on a\nneural network.",

Given a past history of duration events, the question is\nwhether or not that history predisposed the model in favor of certain durations\nrather than others.  For example, if the last six events have all been\ninterpreted as the duration of an eighth note, the expectancy space gives\nwhat amounts to a high probability that the next note will also be an eighth\nnote, somewhat lower probabilities that it will be a sixteenth or quarter note,\nand so on down to a very low probability that it will be a whole note.  Note\nthat the purpose of the algorithm is to reflect how the interpretation system\nactually performs, but that means that each interpretation system in turn may\nbe viewed as reflecting a particular kind of listening behavior.",

This is because they are both based on the rather\ntrivial goal of trying to establish simple integer ratios between successive\ndurations.  Thus, everything is evaluated on a note-by-note basis without any\nattempt to hypothesize how notes are grouped into measures or any other\nhigher-level construct.  However, the expectancy space could be used to\nevaluate any other system which tries to take this sort of rhythmic dictation.\nWhat is important is that it treats such a system as a dynamic function\nprocessing data in real time and displays the relationship between specific\ndata and the behavior of that function.",

One\nis not dealing with highly subjective measurements which try to capture how\nstrong an expectation it.  At any moment in the course of a performance, the\nsystem gives a numerical weight of predisposition for the duration of the next\nevent.  If that next event does not happen, as would be the case with a rest,\nit would not be too far fetched to interpret that weight as the “loudness” of\nthe rest.",

Thus,\nthe main thing we learn from his report is that note-to-note relations do not\ngive us a particularly effective model, particularly when they only take\nduration into account.  If one were to try to develop more realistic\nexpectancy spaces, one would first have to assemble a more comprehensive\nmodel, taking account not only the recognition that duration is organized\nat a higher level than individual notes but also the roles of other parameters\nof performance, such as the pitches of the notes being performed, their\ndynamics, and perhaps their articulation.  Such a model may still be a\nways in the future, but the expectancy space now obliges US to think much\nmore seriously and quantitatively about how it could be implemented.",

                "text": "[9] Let me close with one final nit.  In paragraph [14] Justin writes:  “Meter is\nneither a parameter like pitch or timbre, nor is it a part of a nested\nmeasuring of durational patterns and/or periodicities.  It is something\nthat is heard and felt.”  Are not all aspects of musical sound elements\nthat are “heard and felt?”  Justin’s acknowledgement of phenomenology is\nall very well and good, but I do not think he gives it sufficient attention. anything which is either a musical object or a parameter of a musical object\nis ultimately a construction of the interpreting mind.  That is as true of the\nsonority of a minor triad in first inversion as it is of a ternary metric\npattern.  The real question concerns the nature of the operations of\nconstruction which are brought into play in the course of listening.\nJustin is quite right that they are dynamic for meter;  but, most likely,\nthey are dynamic for all other aspects as well.  The dynamic nature is not\nthe issue.  More important will be how well we shall be able to describe that\nnature in quantitative terms.",

I think it is particular important to recognize the score as\na set of instructions for performance whose information content should\nnot be confused with that of sounding music.  My guess is that one could\naugment his list of cues through which the sounding music can guide how\none taps one’s foot;  but enumerating those cues is not as important as\nacknowledging that such cues are there to be “picked up” from the audible\nsignal.",

The only absolute answer is:  We don’t;  we hypothesize a count.  If we then discover that our count really does\nnot “fit,” we update our hypothesis.  It is this updating of a running\nhypothesis which makes the model “dynamic,” in London’s sense of the word.\nUnfortunately, his paper only began to scratch the surface of those dynamics\n(as did Desain’s work, coming from a different direction).  The biggest rub,\nhowever, has to do with the question of “goodness of fit:”  How do we determine\nwhether or not our current hypothesis should be abandoned.  That, I think, is\nwhere the sorts of cues Joel enumerated enter the picture.  If too many of\nthose cues offer too much evidence against where the hypothesis says the\ndownbeat is, then it is time to change hypotheses.",

                "text": "[12] As a final point I think it is probably important that most of the cues which\ntend to be invoked to assess the running hypothesis are surface features.  When\none analyzes a score, one can find no end of “deep” structural features which\noffer evidence as to where the downbeat really is.  However, I content that\nthose features are another part of the landscape of instructions for\nperformance.  Listeners tend not to read scores, just as listeners to\nnatural language tend not to diagram the sentences they hear.  Rather,\nthey pick up on surface features and respond to them.  Perhaps, then,\nthe real art of performance concerns how the deep features which are\nthe result of careful analysis may be made available as surface features\nto the listening ear.",

What worries me the most is a methodological danger which\nI shall call “selective denial of context.”  It seems as if each interpretation\nchooses to bar certain experiential elements from the context in order to make\nits point, and I am not sure this is a terribly healthy way to go.",

This strikes me as being akin to looking down the wrong end\nof a telescope.  I prefer Lester’s view of the score as a set of instructions\nfor performance.  Thus, in this case the “game” is not one of inferring where,\nand how hard, to tap your foot.  The score tells you that already;  and it is\nthe responsibility of the performer to make sure you “get the message.”\nRather, the “game” is determining when you bring your foot down which\nparticular emphasis on a rest;  where, to some extent, the energy of\nyour stomp may then me taken as a rough measure of the loudness of the\nrest.  This is not a question of the listener resolving any ambiguities\nwhich are latent in the score.  That’s the performer’s job.  Rather, the\nquestion is how the performer endows the listener with a mental state based\non expectancies which set his foot tapping in the first place.  The reason\nI trotted out my Desain hobby horse at the beginning of this discussion was\nbecause his expectancy space provides a means by which such a mental state\nmay be inferred from strings of perceived durations.",

Having now sung Example 3 to myself so many\ntimes that it is beginning to invade my dreams, I have discovered that it is\nbeginning to co-mingle with some more concrete musical memories.  For example,\nwhile the resemblance is not note perfect, it begins with a gesture which we\nall know and love from the last movement of Beethoven’s first symphony.  I feel\nthat such a “family resemblance” is particularly important when considering the\n“responsibility” of the performer.  What I mean is that, because this\nparticular passage is so similar in both pitch and rhythm to a passage\nwhich is in so many listeners’ memories, the performer really does not\nhave to do very much to communicate this particular set of score instructions.\nIndeed, the memory may well be triggered before even that first rest has been\nreached, thus making it all the easier for a mind with a rich memory to control\nthe tapping foot.",
