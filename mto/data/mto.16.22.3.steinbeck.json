    "abstract": "Many music scholars, particularly in jazz studies, have investigated performers’ real-time sonic interactions with one another. Very few, though, have asked how musicians interact with their audiences. The following article examines a performance that demands this kind of analysis: a 1976 concert in which saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell is confronted by an audibly hostile audience.",

He and his bandmates in the Art Ensemble of Chicago were one month into a long tour of Europe, and as August 1976 came to a close, they were enjoying a rare weekend off ( Janssens and de Craen 1983 ). The members of the Art Ensemble decided to spend their downtime in Willisau, Switzerland. A picturesque village near Lucerne, Willisau was home to one of the largest European jazz festivals of 1976, along with San Sebastián, Pescara, Montreux, Moers, Juan-les-Pins, and Châteauvallon ( “Festivals” 1976 , 4–6). The Art Ensemble performed at Châteauvallon on August 22, then headed to Switzerland, where they opened the Willisau festival on August 26 ( Flicker et al. 1976 , 10 and 13; Hardy 1976 , 19). Their next concert—in Italy—was still a few days away, so the musicians stayed in Willisau to experience the rest of the festival. This would give Mitchell and his bandmates a chance to hear their AACM colleague Anthony Braxton, who was scheduled to perform in Willisau on August 28 ( “Festivals” 1976 , 6).",

By late afternoon on the 28th, it was clear that Braxton would not make it to the festival on time. So Niklaus Troxler, the festival organizer, asked Roscoe Mitchell to take Braxton’s spot on the program and perform a solo saxophone concert ( Martin 1977 ). (1) Mitchell agreed. “I ran to the hotel and got my alto,” he recalled: “I had an hour to warm it up” ( Martin 1977 ). Mitchell tried to maximize what little preparation time he was granted. In fact, on the Willisau concert recording, he can be heard playing long tones backstage while he is being introduced by the emcee ( Mitchell 1977 ). (2) Ordinarily he would have preferred to spend several hours warming up, not sixty minutes. But in another sense, he had been preparing for this moment for a decade.

He described these performances as “ practiced solo improvisations”: improvisations based on compositional structures and performance techniques that he had been exploring over a period of months, and even years ( Davis 1983 , 32). According to Mitchell, the point of playing solo is to prove you can sustain a structure for longer and longer periods of time, so I develop exercises to increase my power of concentration, starting off with small sections at first, and while I’m doing that, I’m also working on technique—things like . . . breathing and fingering. It would be nice if every time you started playing . . . the light comes down from the heavens, and you can do no wrong. And you reach that point sometimes—but not every night. So there’s always at least a germ of thought I start off with, even on a completely open improvisation. ( Davis 1983 , 32)",

                "text": "[4] Mitchell decided to begin the Willisau performance with his composition “Nonaah.” The piece had been in his repertoire since 1972, when he composed a brief, étude-like score consisting of six angular phrases for alto saxophone (see Example 1 , from Mitchell 1972 ). By 1973, Mitchell was including minute-long interpretations of “Nonaah” in his solo concerts ( Mitchell 1974 ). He also wrote expanded versions of the piece for various small groups: a sextet score for the Art Ensemble of Chicago and guest pianist Muhal Richard Abrams ( Art Ensemble of Chicago 1974 ); a duet version for piano and saxophone ( Martin 1977 ); and a sketch for saxophone quartet ( Mitchell 1976 ). Mitchell completed the quartet sketch in 1976, shortly before the Willisau festival, and he used the Alto I part as the basis for his impromptu solo performance (see Example 2 ). The quartet is divided into three sections. The first section, labeled quick , consists of a single phrase that spans more than two octaves. As indicated by the vamp marking and the brackets above the staff, the opening phrase can be repeated any number of times (see Example 3 ). Next is the slow second section, where a series of short motives combine to form a longer theme (see Example 4 ). The third and final section of the quartet, also labeled quick , is based on the original 1972 solo score. The opening phrase returns midway through this section, giving the performer(s) an opportunity to “[pull] together” the first and third sections (Mitchell quoted in Martin 1977) and create an elegant ABA’ form (see Example 5 ). And indeed, that is what Mitchell intended to do at Willisau. But when he took the stage, he was faced with an unforeseen obstacle, and he had to adjust his plans to contend with a new emerging reality. In other words, he had to improvise .",

In an audience poll taken at the festival, Braxton was voted “musician of the year” ( Troxler 1976 ). He placed first and second, respectively, in the “miscellaneous instruments” and alto saxophone categories, and his latest Arista recording, Creative Orchestra Music 1976 , was named the year’s best album (Braxton 1976; Troxler 1976). (3) Roscoe Mitchell’s Art Ensemble also earned accolades at Willisau, winning the “group of the year” category, with Anthony Braxton’s quartet finishing second ( Troxler 1976 ). (4) But many in Willisau considered Braxton to be the biggest name on the festival roster. Some audience members, in fact, had traveled hundreds of kilometers to hear his set ( Troxler 2015b ). When the emcee announced that Braxton would not be performing, the festivalgoers were incensed, and they did not hide their displeasure (see Example 6 ). Once Mitchell strode onto the stage, half of the 1,000-member audience assailed him with catcalls and abuse ( Mitchell 2015 ; Troxler 2015b ).",

                "text": "[6] To contemporary listeners, the crowd’s hostility may seem inexplicable. At Willisau, Mitchell was no interloper; rather, he was a highly regarded musician, as shown by the festival poll, where he placed third in the alto saxophone category ( Troxler 1976 ). He and his Art Ensemble bandmates, moreover, had given a well-received performance on the Willisau stage just two nights before his solo concert ( Anders 1976 , 18; Hardy 1976 , 19). Indeed, the reception of the Art Ensemble’s August 26 set casts doubt on one scholar’s theory that the audience’s reaction to Mitchell was about aesthetics—in particular, a desire to hear a group specializing in the “intense, dense ‘energy music’” often performed at 1970s European jazz festivals ( Reason 2004 , 80). To Mitchell, intensity was only one part of a broader sonic palette, an approach that he shared with his AACM colleagues, including Anthony Braxton. As Mitchell explained, “the Chicago people got intense, but they also got soft, and they also were incorporating other sounds into their music” ( Lewis 2008 , 145). Festivalgoers craving “energy music” would not have eagerly waited all day for Braxton’s set, nor would they have reacted so negatively when they learned that he would not be performing. The crowd’s response, therefore, could not have been an aesthetic critique of Mitchell’s saxophone style. Instead, it was a protest by Braxton’s loyal fans, who were upset at Mitchell for daring to take their idol’s place. In the words of one Jazz Magazine critic, “replacing Braxton was unforgivable” ( Hardy 1976 , 20). (5) “Nonaah”: First Section Example 7 .

Then an audience member near the stage shouts at Mitchell—loudly enough to be heard by everyone in the festival hall ( Troxler 2015b ).

Mitchell came to the festival hall to play a solo concert, but he soon found himself in an unexpected “battle” with Anthony Braxton’s supporters. Instead of confronting his antagonists directly, or attempting to ignore them, Mitchell resolved “to make the noise and whatever was going on with the audience part of the piece” ( Martin 1977 ).

At the same time, he introduces subtle variations to the opening phrase, demonstrating that he is indeed engaging with the festivalgoers—but on his terms, not theirs.

So he stabilizes the phrase ending, holding each subsequent G ♯ 4 for approximately four seconds. With this rhythmic transformation complete, Mitchell can turn his attention to E6, the phrase’s first note. He tunes this note differently on each repetition of the phrase, sometimes playing it as much as a half step flat and at other times bending the pitch to create two or three distinct microtones (see Example 9 ).",

Now Mitchell is giving every E6 additional emphasis through his use of expressive intonation. In contrast, the rest of the phrase remains much the same, further highlighting the note that varies from one repetition to another. However, these slight tuning variations do not significantly change how the phrase sounds. Neither does the next variation: a series of dynamic shifts applied to the final G ♯ 4, beginning in the eighth statement.

At the phrase’s end, he lands on G ♮ 4, a semitone below the usual pitch, then gradually bends the note upward so the phrase can conclude on G ♯ 4. These variations catch the festivalgoers’ attention, and a few start to applaud. Mitchell picks up on their reaction and decides to repeat these variations in the next phrase statement. This time, the crowd’s response is even bigger. As Mitchell sustains the final note, a number of audience members clap, whistle, and cheer. When he pauses to breathe, the ovation spills over into the space between phrases—the same interval where, less than two minutes earlier, a heckler yelled at Mitchell.

One is his use of complex timbres: as the performance unfolds, the loudest ovations tend to follow phrase repetitions where Mitchell employs a rougher tone. The festivalgoers also respond favorably to Mitchell’s persistence. After every few statements of the phrase, they offer another round of applause, as if to salute the saxophonist for continuing to repeat and develop the opening phrase in ways that defy all expectations. Mitchell’s commitment to repetition is epitomized by the drawn-out G ♯ 4 that ends each phrase. He holds these notes as long as he can, until just before his breath runs out, transforming each phrase repetition from a compositional choice to a demanding physical feat. In the twenty-fifth statement, he plays the triplets with a rough timbre, then slides into the final G ♯ 4 and sustains it for 4.3 seconds, matching the longest duration heard so far. The audience erupts into an ovation that lasts for twenty seconds, through three more repetitions of the phrase. By the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth statements, Mitchell’s G ♯ 4 has stretched to almost five seconds in length, and the crowd responds in kind, falling silent only when the saxophonist rests (see Example 12 ).

This process begins in the thirty-fifth phrase statement, when he starts changing the pitches in the first group of triplets. Mitchell also reintroduces the complex timbres he employed earlier, this time focusing on the midrange A4s and A5s just before the G ♯ 4 at the phrase’s end. Finally, in the forty-fourth statement, Mitchell is ready to apply his timbral transformations to the longest note of the phrase. He plays through the phrase using an incredibly rough tone—so coarse, in fact, that when he arrives at G ♯ 4, the note breaks up into five distinct attacks.

At this point in the performance, Mitchell later recalled, “my alto had just given in to me. . . . I started to open it up soundwise by putting in smears and different sounds” ( Martin 1977 ). Now that his saxophone is cooperating, Mitchell can push the phrase to its parametric limits.

He uses a similar tag to introduce the next statement of the phrase, and the festivalgoers applaud as he leads them into unexplored territory. Only seconds after an arrival that could have ended the piece, Mitchell is venturing deeper into the sound-world of “Nonaah” (see Example 16 ). As he observed after the concert, the musical ideas on which the composition is based “all come from the same world or atmosphere. The thing about ‘Nonaah’ is that once you put yourself in that atmosphere you can ride on forever. The world has the properties of very large skips [,] and it has notes that have accidental qualities that are kept” ( Martin 1977 ). In other words, “Nonaah” offers Mitchell endless possibilities for variation, from the phrases that make up the composition to the new ideas that emerge spontaneously during performance.",

He often focuses on one of the theme’s seven motives, reordering its notes or distilling the motive into a single gesture. At other times, he treats the theme more strictly, playing several motives in sequence with few alterations (see Example 21 ). Through all of this, the audience maintains a respectful silence. In their earlier sonic interactions, Mitchell and the festivalgoers resolved their initial conflict and showed that they were indeed listening to each other.

                "text": "[29] This analysis is also one of the first to demonstrate how real-time interactions with listeners can directly influence an improvisation. To some readers, it may seem curious that such an analysis has few precedents. After all, interaction is a major topic in the literature on jazz, the form of improvised music that has received the most notice from music scholars. The study of interaction in jazz improvisation was pioneered two decades ago in a pair of landmark texts, Paul Berliner’s Thinking in Jazz ( 1994 ) and Ingrid Monson’s Saying Something ( 1996 ). Both of these books briefly address performer-audience interaction: Berliner describes a “communication loop” between musicians and listeners, “in which the actions of each continuously affect the other” ( 1994 , 459) while Monson characterizes performers and audiences as members of a “community of interpreters” to whom every “sonic detail [is] socially meaningful” ( 1996 , 127). However, Berliner and Monson would write little else about musician-listener interaction, concentrating instead on the interactions among the members of a performing ensemble. Other jazz researchers have followed suit, contributing much to our understanding of musicians’ interactions ( Cannone and Garnier 2011 ; Givan 2016 ; Hodson 2007 ; Michaelsen 2013 ; Waters 2011 ) and the social contexts of jazz performance ( Ashe 1999 ; Brand et al. 2012 ; Lewis 2000 ; Sarath 2013 , 214–16) but neglecting to analyze performer-audience interaction.

                "text": "[30] The most extensive treatment of performer-audience interaction may be found in Christopher Washburne’s Sounding Salsa ( 2008 ). Here, Washburne develops Berliner’s notion of the performer-audience “communication loop,” shifting the scene from urban jazz venues to East Coast nightclubs where salsa bands play for dancers ( 2008 , 63 and 66). Writing from the perspective of a veteran salsero , Washburne examines performer-audience interaction from every angle, analyzing the musical structures that facilitate salsa dancing, the verbal dialogues between bandleaders and dancers, and the social, sonic, and spatial environments in which salsa performances occur ( 2008 , 55–76). Ethnography is at the core of Washburne’s research: he spent years playing trombone in top-notch Latin bands, and he interviewed numerous figures on the New York salsa scene, from prominent bandleaders to everyday working musicians.",

                "text": "[31] Like the ethnographic analyses in Washburne’s Sounding Salsa , my analysis of “Nonaah” is informed by conversations and communications with people who were in Willisau on August 28, 1976—namely, Roscoe Mitchell ( 2015 ) and Niklaus Troxler ( 2015a ; 2015b ). But my approach is ultimately centered on sound, the audible traces of the interactions between Mitchell and the Willisau festivalgoers. The audience members’ reaction when Mitchell appears onstage, the musical decisions Mitchell makes in response to their antagonism, and the crowd’s eventual embrace of the saxophonist—all of these interactions take place in the sonic domain, and all are essential to the performance. Indeed, it could be said that the sonic exchanges between Mitchell and the audience are the performance, more so than the compositional sketch that the saxophonist brought with him to the festival stage. Analyzing performer-audience interaction, therefore, may be the only way to comprehend pieces like “Nonaah,” where musicians and listeners are more than producers and consumers: rather, they are partners in co-creation.
