    "abstract": "The analysis of the structural repercussions of musicians’ strategies has traditionally focused on their handling of timing and dynamics, not only because of the correlation found in performances between hierarchical phrase structure and coordinated decreases in both parameters—usually referred to as phrase arching (Gabrielsson 1988) or phrase-final lengthening (Todd 1985;Repp 1990—but also because of these parameters’ easier quantification. However, other parameters, including articulation, can play equally significant roles in the emergence and potential perception of musical structures. The processes of performance and inference are, moreover, so unique to each musician and/or beholder that revisions of traditional approaches to musical form have become necessary. To explore this phenomenon, I study both the score and five recordings of the finale from Brahms’s first cello sonata, op. 38. The junctures where the transition and the recapitulation start are indeterminate. In addition, the piece employs procedures typical of both the sonata and the fugue to produce a formal hybrid that poses significant quandaries to both performers and analysts. Focusing on the selected musicians’ manipulations of articulation, this article aims to determine whether this parameter might, along with timing and dynamics, be relevant in the emergence and perception of formal relations. The study also addresses the ways in which formal ambiguity can be materialized, concealed, and created in performance, ultimately investigating how musical form can, on the basis of its performance, be considered as multivalent.",

Among those, ca. 35% are of the TR↔S type ( Horton 2017 , 163 and 165, Tables 7 and 8). Therefore, the elided MC in the op. 38, iii is typical of Brahms’s chamber practice.",

Most scholars studying articulation simply extend analytical methods originally devised for timing and dynamics ( Bayley 1996 ; Dodson 2002 ; Drake and Palmer 1993 ; Fabian 2017 ; Leong 2019 ; Lester 1995 ; 1998 ).

By the same token, the structural relations that they infer from composers’ scores may not influence the ways in which they play or sing. They may want to conceal or even dispense with structural relations determined from score analysis ( Vande Moortele 2009 , 311–12), (5) instead creating structures that may not be apparent analytically ( Dunsby 1995 ), (6) sometimes through specific performance “motives” ( Eitan 2003 ; Rink 2015 ; Rink, Spiro, and Gold 2011 ; Spiro, Gold, and Rink 2010 ).

This is done to place the selected recordings in a broader context and introduce some necessary terminology. It further reenacts part of the process of performance itself, in which interpretation typically develops by taking in the composer’s score. In a similar vein, the following analyses take as their point of departure the quandaries that the score of the Allegro third movement from Brahms’s E minor cello sonata poses to its performers, whether or not they are explicitly aware of them. Just as performers’ decisions are often provisional and subject to reflection over time as they live with the work, some of my preliminary conclusions will be revised. Similarly, some theoretical discussions will emerge later and more organically, in response to analysis of a given recording. By adapting these approaches, I aim to bring theory and practice into closer dialogue. Example 1 . Brahms, op. 38, iii, mm. 1–11 (click to enlarge) Example 2 .

(12) P presents a fugal subject (SUB) with two countersubjects (CS1 and CS2) ( Example 1 ), (13) the SUB being based on Contrapunctus XIII from J. S. Bach’s Art of Fugue . (14) The harmonic movement in mm. 1–24 delineates the standard pattern of tonic-dominant-tonic ( Example 2 ). (15) After motivic manipulation, Brahms presents the subject over the natural sixth scale degree in m. 25. The beat displacement with respect to the original entry in m. 1 prompts a metric acceleration towards m. 31. The subject re-enters there, realigned with the notated meter and over the tonic harmony, simultaneously in both recto and inverted forms. For its part, S has a more lyrical and tranquillo character ( Example 3 ). The two theme groups are connected through a transition (TR) that ends in an elided III:PAC MC (Horton 2017). (16) Even with the PAC enhancing the fusion between TR and S (TR↔S) (Caplin 1998, 203), (17) the exposition, which is not repeated, (18) in principle conforms to the traditional view that the two theme groups in sonata form contrast with one another. (19) After the animato development section (m. 76ff.), a “reordered,” “reversed,” or “mirror” recapitulation ( Jackson 1996 , 1997 ; Rosen 1988 ; Vande Moortele 2021 ) starts with S over the principal dominant harmony (m. 123ff). (20) P (m. 132ff.) and TR are subsequently recapitulated over the tonic before the più presto coda (m. 175ff.).",

Even more than tempo and dynamics, the perception of articulation is at least partly mediated by unique perception thresholds that encompass a wide range of factors including speed (attack and release rate), the technology used while recording and/or listening, personal preferences and responses, performance experience, etc. In other words, do we all define legato playing in the same way? How do we explain how we differentiate empirically between spiccato and staccato in string playing? Why do some performers play a specific passage with longer bow strokes or with less pedal than others? Because of such variations, my interpretations to follow are based on both my personal impressions and measurements made on spectrographic images. (21) (They are, in other words, the interpretations of a trained listener with many years’ experience in playing Brahms’s op. 38, which are further guided and confirmed by empirical observations.) My listening impressions have guided the analysis by directing the attention towards specific effects, yet they have never determined it. In fact, there have been many cases in which conflict has arisen between my perception and the measurements. (Similarly, readers’ perceptions of the selected recordings may differ from the conclusions I present in this text.) In such moments I give preference to the measurements made on the spectrograms, prompting me to reflect on the validity of exclusive empirical analysis when it comes to performance. Example 4 .

                "text": "[2.5] Empirical analysis helps us avoid unsupported, wholly subjective claims. To analyze articulation quantitatively, I employ a method uniquely geared towards this parameter. The method recognizes three broad categories of articulation depending on the relative sustaining of the lower partials, i.e., those up to the second octave from the fundamental frequency; these are listed below. Such requires manually measuring the percentage of the inter-onset interval (IOI) during which each note is held. The divergent classification criteria for the piano and the cello reflect the percussive quality of the piano, in contrast with the cello’s bowed and, thus, more easily sustaining nature ( Llorens 2018 , 109–10): Legato: “successive notes in performance [are] connected [virtually] without any intervening silence of articulation” ( Chew 2001 ). In this type of articulation, the spectrographic image shows that the lower partials are maintained for over 95% of the IOI in the case of the cello, and over 90% in the piano ( Example 4 ). (22) Long staccato: in the spectrograms, the lower partials are seen to be sustained for over 75% of the IOI in the cello, and over 70% in the piano ( Example 5 ). Sharp staccato: clearly disconnected notes ( Boyden and Walls 2001 ). It is visible when the spectrogram shows low overtone sustainment below 75% of the IOI in the cello and below 70% in the piano ( Example 6 ). To diminish the amount of numerical data in the article and thus to facilitate reading, I frequently transcribe the results in the form of specific symbols for legato (—), long staccato (·) and short staccato (··) in conjunction with staff notation. For the occasions in which my initial perceptions did not coincide with the empirical results, I also provide specific measurements of onset and offset times and percentage of the IOI. Example 5 . Type 2 articulation: long staccato; as in Brahms, op. 38, iii, Fournier (cello) and Backhaus (piano), first quarter note of m. 1 (click to enlarge) Example 6 .

As such, “hesitations” (analogous to GFL) as well as “elongations”—i.e., agogic emphases at downbeats—may serve as cues in the inference of phrase structure.",

To further probe such micro-scale techniques, I performed Kohonen-network analyses ( Spiro, Gold, and Rink 2010 ) on the five recordings. These computer-assisted (25) analyses serve to organize and cluster the data in the form of recurrent patterns. Applied to audio data, they help to determine which specific timing and dynamic patterns the performers use, in which measures the patterns surface, and their relative prominence. In this way, such patterns can be viewed as performance “motives” that emerge across the recordings analyzed and that may serve as a “link between structure and expression” ( Eitan 2003 , 213). Importantly, the patterns determined by such Kohonen analyses do not typically reflect precise measurements that are repeated exactly; rather, they usually concern general, average profiles (i.e., proportional increases and decreases in timing and dynamics), to which the actual performances conform. The software, further, does not place the detected patterns in the context of the large-scale tempo and dynamic fluctuations, hence the need for careful evaluation. Example 7 .

Data on tempo and duration at the quarter-note level were extracted, as well as smoothed values for dynamics. Dynamic values were then aligned with the position of the quarter notes using the online application Dyn-A-Matic. (27) To find patterns of equal length, I grouped the measurements by the largest common unit possible. In this case, it was by measures, as not all the phrases in Brahms’s op. 38, iii are divisible by larger units. The computer is trained using tabular data either on the durational percentage that a quarter note occupies within its measure ( Example 7 ), or on the dynamic fluctuation from every quarter-note beat with respect to the following one ( Example 8 ). After the training stage, the software returns a description and a bar graph of the patterns found and a list of where these patterns are found in the recording(s). As mentioned above, the program does not consider larger-scale fluctuations; it explores only beat-to-beat differences. In all cases, I experimented with carrying out the analyses with different degrees of precision. As the resultant patterns were always congruent with one another, I opted to present the data obtained with the two precision degrees that gave the most clearly interpretable results: medium (1000 nodes in normal mode) and high (2000 nodes in accurate mode).

Moreover, at the start of both the development (mm. 76–79) and the coda (mm. 175–179), Brahms develops at length SUB’s triplet figuration, causing the performers’ potential focus on extending the initial articulation to those passages as well. Notably, the metric emphasis on the tied quarter notes on the second beats is inherited from the first movement, where the piano accompaniment in P counteracts the strong beats of the measure, further extending articulation preoccupations beyond the limits of the movement.

As an example, Rostropovich and Serkin ( Rostropovich and Serkin 1983 ) invariably (29) accentuate the initial quarter note of SUB and then detach it from the one on the second beat (articulation types 2 and 3, as classified above). They then link the tied quarter notes of those second beats to the ensuing triplet eighth notes (articulation type 1). These eighth notes, for their part, are always played in long staccato strokes under articulation 2 ( Example 10 ). In mm. 1–4, 31–34, 91–94, 99–102, 115–118, 119–122, 132–135, 136–139, and 152–155, the musicians employ a sharp staccato articulation (type 3) for the initial quarter note of SUB, whereas on the other occasions they resort to articulation 2 for that note. That is, the shorter type of articulation is perceived to signal the most important structural junctures: the starts of P and the “merged” TR in both the exposition and the recapitulation, as well as every time the material appears in the development.

On the basis of sonata theory, one may view m. 31 ( Example 11 ) as the start of a “merged” transitional unit (TR) extending the activity of the first subject: its initial measures present the SUB in both recto and inverted forms simultaneously, dissolving itself “mid-phrase into transitional procedures” (P→TR) ( Hepokoski and Darcy 2006 , 94). (31) TR, starting in m. 31, involves a “functional transformation,” as described by Horton ( 2017 , 176; 2019 , 52–56) (32) and Martin and Vande Moortele ( 2014 , 134). On the basis of its initial failure to modulate in its first seven measures, it is possible to divide it into two modules. The first module in mm. 31–37 would “become” the second half of a compound P, being interpretable as ultimately thematic (P←TR). (33) The second (mm. 38–52), which initially seems to be part of P, becomes a transition because of the modulation process (P→TR) ( Horton 2014 , 194–95; 2017 , 175–77; 2019 , 52–56). (34) In this manner, the two modules can also be seen to form a single unit with a double function from beginning to end (P↔TR) ( Martin and Vande Moortele 2014 , 147–49). Example 12 .

(35) Although these views of TR do not fit well within a sonata theory framework, support can be found through analysis of articulation in the selected recordings.

There, Casals delays the entrances of the notes, thereby creating an expressive sense of asynchronization between the two parts.

They avoid strong internal punctuations by keeping both tempo and dynamics stable. While doing so, they resort to relatively strong initial agogic accents and to GFLs to reinforce specific boundaries. Among the three timing patterns detected in their rendition ( Example 18 ), T2 F/B displays the strongest initial elongation, whereas T3 F/B most clearly reflects GFL. (40) Through the use—or avoidance—of T2 F/B and T3 F/B , P in the exposition and S in the recapitulation are more perceptually segmented, whereas S in the exposition and P in the recapitulation are phrased in longer units. (41) With regard to articulation, in the exposition P leads with its staccato articulation; in the second, S’s more lyrical character prevails. In summary, the various thematic materials are played with varying articulations and are thus perceived as structurally different: P in the exposition: staccato and segmented S in the exposition: staccato and unified S in the recapitulation: legato and segmented P in the recapitulation: legato and unified (Example 25, a). P and S, then, do not diametrically contrast with one another; rather, they adapt themselves depending on the order in which they appear within each rotation. This strategy impacts the TR too: in the exposition, m. 31 is more clearly demarcated through microtiming and articulation strategies than in the recapitulation. Video Example 2 .

Some performers, such as Rostropovich and Serkin, articulate P so sharply that it affects S too, thereby diminishing the latter’s salience. Yet, as we have seen, still other performers may also play both subjects legato, which has the effect of emphasizing S’s dominance (Meneses and Pires). Other approaches include playing those materials differently, more or less similarly in both the exposition and the recapitulation (Polo and Nebolsin), or in a totally different way depending on the large-scale section and the ordering of the materials within it (Fournier and Backhaus). In other words, Brahms’s defiance of the traditional expressive opposition between sonata-form theme groups has significant formal implications for the performed structure(s) of this movement, or vice versa, and potentially of the sonata as a whole, particularly since the issue of the relation between the two theme groups impacts the opening movement as well.

(46) Such non-congruence applies to movements in which the returns of the main key and of the main thematic material in the recapitulation do not coincide, as is the case in the op. 38 Allegro. As Example 2 shows, not only does the recapitulation of the thematic materials from the exposition start in m. 123 with S over a dominant harmony, but the E minor tonic returns as late as in the fifth measure of the recapitulated P (m. 136).

Even mm. 95–98, which are the only place in the development where the four dynamic patterns appear, are played in a lyrical vein, with wide vibrato and a generally rich overall tone color. The use of the four dynamic patterns in a single structural unit, in conjunction with legato articulation, endows that unit with enhanced structural salience. By these means, Meneses and Pires project the sense of a higher-order central block that starts in m. 53 and ends in m. 131. Within this central block, the following articulations and dynamic strategies alternate: S in the exposition (m. 53ff.): legato with D4 M/P ; mm. 76–94: staccato (type 2) and no D4 M/P ; mm. 95–98: legato with D4 M/P ; mm. 99–104: staccato (type 2) and no D4 M/P ; mm. 105–114: legato with D4 M/P ; mm. 115–122: staccato (type 2) and no D4 M/P ; and S in the recapitulation (mm. 123-131): legato with D4 M/P .

(51) At the same time, there are no marked ritardandos preceding the changes; thus, the recording cannot be explained in terms of phrase-arching theory ( Video Example 3 ).

These points help listeners perceive two internal units: TR in the exposition (with m. 31 being signaled dynamically and m. 53 agogically) and S in the recapitulation (with m. 123 being marked dynamically and m. 132 agogically). As a result, the continuity between P and TR in the exposition, and between S and P in the recapitulation, is enhanced, perhaps to the point of suggesting a transformational process of becoming ( Schmalfeldt 2011 ). In Casals and Horszowski’s recording, then, articulation is crucial for the highest-order structural organization of the movement, whereas timing and dynamics are critically responsible for the lower-order punctuations therein.",

From the point of view of articulation, the recapitulated S is treated almost like a passing episode within a larger-scale section: development (+ S) || P. Moreover, the performers use type-4 articulation (two triplet eighth notes plus one), which gives the actual opening in mm. 1–4 such distinctive personality, not in mm. 132–135, where the thematic material is recapitulated, but at the beginning of the development section. Measure 76 thus receives enhanced structural weight, causing the recapitulation of P to be assimilated as part of a larger formal unit. Concurrently, the tempo and the dynamic levels decrease more before m. 76 than before m. 132. They do so again, and even more conspicuously, before the start of the coda in m. 175. From there onwards, and coinciding with the movement’s ESC, the legato articulation culminates, converting the coda into the climactic section (52) within the sonata form. In fact, the allegedly most defining feature of the form, i.e., the double return of the tonic and the opening material, is not marked in performance, thus favoring the accumulation of momentum from m. 76 up to the cantabile and rubato outburst of m. 175ff.",

What remains to been seen—and will be discussed in the following section—is how this ambiguity interacts with the other structural strategies. Through exploring this interplay, the idea of ambiguity in Brahms’s op. 38 finale (and in Brahms’s compositions more generally) acquires new meaning in the light of performed sound. * * *",

The music’s multivalence is particularly acute at the beginnings of the transition and the recapitulation, posing relevant challenges for performance apropos the relation between the two main theme groups. (54) We may see the movement as articulating “its sonata component within the context of an overarching fugal design” ( Smith 1995 , 285, fn 215) or, alternatively, as a sonata-form movement with some “contrapuntal details” ( Pascall 1972 , 223). The two formal schemes may also be considered to operate on an equal footing as they oppose different languages. (55)",

Each of the analyzed recordings presents a singular aesthetic response. (56) On occasions, the musicians seem to offer structural interpretations that may not appear consistent with “scholarly,” score-based analyses. This applies not only to junctures which are more overtly open to formal ambiguity, but even to passages where Brahms’s score seems to be absolutely clear: recall, for instance, Meneses and Pires’s handling of the beginning of the central section (m. 76ff.). Even the potential formal implications of the fugal writing in the movement is subject to this treatment. It can be made clearly manifest (as in Rostropovich and Serkin’s interpretation) or relegated to a superficial, stylistic role within a more recognizable sonata design (as in the four other recordings).",

As observed in respect to Casals and Horszowski’s interpretation, articulation may compensate for the effects of timing and dynamics. The performers’ use of specific timing and dynamic sequences serves to signal the main theme groups in a sort of “performatively” reordered recapitulation. They employ the same technique to mark other middle-level junctures, such as the transition and the start of the coda. However, their articulation strategies, with the two staccato-to-legato progressions, serve to conform two larger-scale blocks (Example 25, b). (57) In this manner, they make S in the recapitulation play a transitional function within a larger unit, and similarly the transition in the exposition hinders the thematic role of S. Polo and Nebolsin’s playing, on the contrary, opposes the two theme groups (2+1 articulation for P, type 4, and legato, type 1, for S) and minimizes the recapitulation’s salience to support a climactic, formally weightier coda. In fact, these performers play the coda legato in violation of Brahms’s directions , which results in the staccato articulation (types 2 and 3) being relegated to less salient passages (Example 25, e). For its part, mostly through articulation, the fugal process elements in Rostropovich and Serkin’s rendition acquires enhanced influence over the sonata form (Example 25, c). This is mostly produced by this duo’s resorting to the same short-staccato articulation for all the appearances of SUB in the exposition, the development, and the recapitulation alike. Example 25 .

Meneses and Pires emphasize the lyrical imprint of S so conspicuously that it affects the fugal materials, too. In fact, the lyricism of S in its two emergences, in conjunction with the performers’ use of the four dynamics patterns, represents the extent of their staccato playing in the development. In this manner, they construct a broad unit from m. 53 to m. 131, i.e., from the expositional S until the recapitulated P. This lyricism turns the movement into a tripartite structure with a large central section that itself has a highly legato core (Example 25, d). In the Fournier and Backhaus recording, on the contrary, the materials do not oppose one another; rather, the first material in each rotation dominates the second of them: staccato in the exposition and legato in the recapitulation. It is the exposition’s primary character, as determined by the performers’ approach to the fugal materials, that contrasts with that of the recapitulation, as shaped by S’s lyrical quality in m. 123ff. In this manner, these musicians play a “thematically” and expressively reordered recapitulation, in which the performative realization of the elements, as determined by their position and not by their theoretically inherent character, plays the most significant role in the projection and, potentially, inference of structural connections (Example 25, a).",

The foregoing analyses have shown that both performative elements and score-based parameters can be influential in the creation and inference of specific structural relations. Similarly, timing/dynamics and articulation have been shown to have diverging effects on the structural perception of the movement; at times, I have ventured to insinuate that articulation is structurally dominant. Having said that, I recognize that such a statement may be personally biased and perhaps unnecessary. Performers’ strategies may be as formally multivalent as Brahms’s score itself; thus, ambiguity and “non-congruence” may enter the field of performance (and of its analysis too), as the discussion regarding the data for the two theme groups in the Fournier and Backhaus recording has exemplified. In any case, the article has shown how the analysis of articulation patterns may, in the context of individual renditions, be highly illuminating from a structural vantage point, especially in conjunction with observations on other parameters.",

In some of the five recordings analyzed, the cellist and the pianist seem not to aim for unified articulation, which points to potentially non-congruent conceptualization. As the brief discussion of vibrato brought to light, articulation could also be explored in relation to performers’ technical command, and physical and emotional memory. Similarly, the perception of articulation may be mediated by our embodied engagement with the sound itself. The analyses presented in this article resulted not only from my assessment of the “hard” data, but also from my bodily and technologically mediated impressions, which guided my attention towards specific performance strategies. A wide set of interpretations are possible for any single recording, thus readers may not agree with mine. Such disagreements are indeed desirable, and can serve to enrich our approaches to performance and to musical structure. They equally help us to assess the significance of numerical data when evaluating sounds that were never produced to be quantified but rather conceived as the triggers of a series of listening experiences.",
