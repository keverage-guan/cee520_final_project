    "abstract": "In this article, I draw on public-facing sources and my violinistic experience to show how attention to performance technique illustrates three different relationships between performance and analysis. In the Largo from J.S. Bach’s Sonata No. 3 for Solo Violin (BWV 1005), multiple-stop chords, string-based affordances, and bowings in turn correspond with, contradict, and create new analytical perspectives. I first collate definitions of interpretation and technique as they relate to performance. Interpretation is non-instrument-specific and deals with decoding and expressing musical meaning; techniqueisinstrument-specific and deals with the granular mechanics of sound production. A multiple-stop intensity model shows that changes in a violinist’s multiple-stop-based effortcorrespondwith significant cadential markers. At the local level, the violinistic “feel” of each quadruple stop aligns with expressive aspects of harmony and form. Heinrich Schenker’s performance recommendations for the Largo’s cadences, by contrast,conflictwith a violinist’s experience of how the cadences intersect with instrumental affordances. Although the two perspectives may be reconcilable, actual performances support the instrument-grounded perspective. Finally, I draw on basic bowing motions tocreatean analytical technique of bowing reduction. My reduction of the Largo reveals a recurring bowing-based motive, which in turn elucidates the source of a performative tension I have experienced when playing the movement. This final example reminds us that technique and interpretation—just like performance and analysis—are inevitably entangled.",

Cook is careful to point out, however, that “it would certainly not be adequate to consider these performances as simply illustrating what Schenker said in his Ninth Symphony monograph. There are many occasions when Furtwängler puts in rallentandos which Schenker proscribes, or omits dynamic shading[s] which Schenker insists on as indispensable. On the other hand, time and again Furtwängler shapes his phrases, balances his instrumentation or articulates formal junctures in ways which do match what Schenker says, or which at least seem to belong within the same language of performance that Schenker is talking” (109).",

To further investigate the multifaceted relationships between performance and analysis, I focus on multiple stops, string-based affordances, and bowings in the Largo from J.S. Bach’s Sonata No. 3 in C Major for Solo Violin, BWV 1005/iii (henceforth “the Largo”). These three techniques correspond with, conflict with, and create new analytical approaches, respectively.

While interpretation tends to be non-instrument-specific and associated with musical expression, technique tends to be instrument-specific and to deal with the granular mechanics of sound production. However, interpretation and technique are not mutually opposed; performers make technical and interpretive decisions hand in hand with one another.

First, I create a multiple-stop-based intensity model that illustrates how multiple-stop distribution aligns with significant structural markers. To complement this bird’s-eye view, I show how the violinistic “feel” of each quadruple stop connects elements of technique to harmonic and formal insights. I then contrast a violinist’s perspective on how three cadential textures fit on the violin with Heinrich Schenker’s performance recommendations for those cadences. On the surface, the two perspectives conflict, but reconsidering the source of the conflict suggests that the incongruity may be reconcilable. Nonetheless, four specific performances of the Largo bear out the conflict. Finally, I take the simple motion of bowing as a springboard for creating an analytical technique of bowing reduction . The reduction reveals an embodied, bowing-based motive, which in turn clarifies questions about performance interpretation. This final example highlights how technique and interpretation reciprocally inform one another. Throughout the article, I reference public-facing sources (such as popular magazines and online discussion boards) to incorporate technique-based insights of professional and amateur musicians alike. Such sources offer music scholars an untapped wellspring of performers’ perspectives, especially for repertoire so widely beloved and exhaustively discussed as solo Bach. 1.

The recent turn towards technique in performance-and-analysis discourse warrants exploration of these key terms.

These authors suggest that performers, analysts, listeners, and composers can all interpret a musical work. In the context of performance, additional meanings of interpretation emerge. When performers interpret music, they may “decode” a score ( 2020 , 256) or solve “a problem” ( Clarke et al. 2005 , 43) in order to achieve specific “expressive aims” ( Peebles 2018 , [1.3]). Interpretations may also change over time ( Clarke et al. 2005 , 48) and involve creativity ( Leong 2019 , 63–66). (3) Specific musical dimensions that scholars associate with performance interpretation include tempo and timing fluctuations ( Duinker 2021 ; Lester 1995 ), as well as timbre, tone, and dynamics ( Lowe 2003 , 71). Some scholars add further layers of analytical interpretation by showing how musical features of a performer’s interpretation can convey metric, hypermetric, or voice-leading structures ( Brumbeloe 2000 ; McCreless 2009 ).",

Interpretation encompasses these difficult-to-describe combinations of dynamics, touch, timing, tone, etc. that distinguish one performance from another and create what we colloquially call “expression.” Technique entails the physical aspects of practicing and performing that are shaped by the relationship between instrumental affordances and a performer’s capabilities ( De Souza 2017 , 12–13). On the surface, these definitions suggest a mind/body opposition between interpretation and technique. But as any performer will tell you, the process of developing reliable technique requires thoughtful repetition and consistent refinement. In other words, both the mind and the body are involved in developing technique (just as they are both involved in crafting an interpretation). Peter Kaminsky aptly describes interpretation and technique as “porous” categories: a performer often makes technical decisions with specific interpretive goals in mind, and vice versa ( 2016 , [11]). (4) For example, a violinist might choose to “stop” a note that could be played as an open string in order to convey a sense of warmth and richness, or they might add some rubato to a quadruple stop featuring open strings in order to revel in the sense of physical release that the open strings provide. Ultimately, clarifying what interpretation and technique entail allows us to better understand the applicability, limits, and overlaps between them.",

In solo Bach, common technical concerns include bowings, fingerings, multiple stops, and articulations. However, different movements of the sonatas and partitas foreground specific techniques to varying degrees. (6) In the dense fugues, a violinist might dedicate abundant time to finessing multiple stops (especially the pesky four-note chords), whereas in slow movements, they might focus on questions of fingerings or when to use open strings. In other words, the “script” of musical notation ( Cook 2001 , [15]) and violinistic affordances intersect to create a constellation of movement-specific technical challenges. 2.

The intensity model shows that changes in multiple-stop intensity across the Largo strikingly correspond with form-defining cadences. In general, a violinist invests more physical effort with more notes in a multiple stop. They traverse more physical space with the bow arm and (usually) place more left-hand fingers down on the fingerboard. As Laurie Niles ( 2022 ), founder of Violinist.com, writes, “The triple or quadruple stop has its own kind of technique that is quite different than running 16 th notes, melodic lines and even double-stops. You can’t take it for granted—it needs special attention, and it needs special practice.” I characterize this special kind of multiple-stop technique—the extra bit of effort required—as multiple-stop intensity .

I assign each multiple stop in the Largo an intensity value: double stops receive an intensity value of 1, triple stops a value of 2, and quadruple stops a value of 3. The sum of the individual multiple-stop intensity values in a given measure determines the overall intensity value for that measure ( Example 2 ). For example, the two double stops in m. 1 together impart an intensity value of 2 to that measure, whereas the three double stops and two triple stops in m. 7 yield an intensity value of 7.

Both the PAC in V and the first PAC in I precede an immediate decrease in multiple-stop intensity (from 7 to 3 and 7 to 0, respectively). (7) Similarly, multiple-stop intensity increases towards the PAC in ii (m. 13), though here it only peaks at a value of 4 and falls more gradually across the next two measures. The authentic cadence in m. 4 is the only exception to this pattern. Like with the other cadences, multiple-stop intensity increases towards the cadence, peaking at a value of 4. Rather than decrease following the cadence, however, the intensity value momentarily continues to increase—little wonder, as the thus far slow-moving bass line suddenly bursts into a short-lived rhythmic flurry in m. 5. Overall, though, the pattern of intensity peaking around cadences prevails: the technical element of multiple stops corresponds with a music-analytical insight.",

(8) But listeners might also experience the harmonic tension ramping up towards and falling after each PAC. Indeed, scholars and performers alike often characterize the dominant–tonic relationship—especially at cadences—as that of tension and release. Thus, intensity in the Largo manifests in two domains: the technical/physical, measured by shifts in the violinist’s effort in executing multiple stops, and the harmonic/expectational, understood through enculturated norms of harmony and form in common-practice tonal music.",

Additionally, multiple-stop intensity could be parsed across musical segments longer or shorter than a single measure. The intensity “slices” could even be shifted to cut across bar lines. Still other musical features beyond multiple stops alone—such as rhythm or bowing technique—can impact a violinist’s experience of intensity. For example, when the abundant thirty-second notes appear in the codetta (mm. 18–21), the violinist significantly increases their left-hand activity towards the impending final cadence.

(9) For string and keyboard players, such instances of textural thickening almost surely necessitate an intensification of physical effort. Performers’ shifts of effort exemplify one facet of Daphne Leong’s ( 2019 , 10) expansive view of musical structure, which encompasses “structure in embodied action [and] sounding structure as created by performers.” Multiple stops in the Largo, then, connect technique-based, embodied structuring processes with familiar notions of musical structure—in this case, the phrase organization of the binary form.

Unlike several double and triple stops in the movement, each quadruple stop has only a single viable fingering option. As such, individual violinists’ performance experiences of the quadruple stops will be more similar than their experiences of moments with several fingering options. Much like the intensity model does on a global level, the violinistic feel of each quadruple stop reveals local connections between technique and analysis.

In this quadruple stop, the violinist uses two different fingers to stop three different strings (the highest note is an open E5). The violinist begins with their second finger on B ♭ 3 on the G string, then “hops” the second finger over the third (which is playing G4 on the D string) to land on C5 on the A string ( Example 6 ). Especially compared to the relaxed, open hand frame of the quadruple stop just a few measures earlier, the finger hop feels awkward and unidiomatic. The technique is especially marked in the context of the Largo, as no other multiple stop requires a finger hop. To execute the chord with clarity, the violinist must precisely coordinate the left-hand fingers with the bow arm.

(13) The V 2 4 opens space for the subsequent I 6 to initiate the 3 ˆ – 4 ˆ – 5 ˆ bass line that ultimately secures the structural arrival in I ( Example 7 , mm. 16–17). Atop this conventional cadential motion, familiar material returns. The sequential melody that prepared the structural PAC in V resurfaces, now transposed down by fifth ( Example 8 , mm. 6–7). Because of the violin’s tuning, the down-by-fifth (rather than up-by-fourth) transposition means that the violinist’s finger patterns exactly map between the two passages.

The second and fourth fingers pull towards one another on the lower strings to outline a diminished seventh (B3– A ♭ 4); the third finger on the A string tucks in close to the fourth to establish an augmented fourth ( A ♭ 4–D5); and the first finger awkwardly stretches back for a “low 1” F5 on the E string ( Example 9 ).

The third and fourth (or second and third) fingers reach away from one another to outline a spacious—though not yet settled—major sixth on the D and G strings ( Example 11 ). The stretching feeling of the sixth is especially pronounced on the lower strings—the violinist must internally rotate their left arm farther under the violin in order to reach the interval.

The cramped, tangled fingers of the tension-filled diminished seventh chord starkly contrast the reaching, stretching fingers of the expectant cadential harmony.

Even in these twilight moments of the movement, technical and harmonic dimensions continue to reinforce one another. If the violinist begins the trill on the E with an appoggiatura from above—as many violinists do—the quadruple stop begins with two perfect fifths (C4–G4 and B ♭ 4–F5). To play a single double-stop fifth, a violinist uses a left-hand technique that resembles guitarists’ technique for playing barre chords; that is, they use one finger to simultaneously stop two adjacent strings. Unlike on a fretted instrument, a violinist must make further adjustments to account for intonation. To this end, the violinist might employ a combination of strategies, including flattening their typically rounded fingers, swinging their elbow a bit to the left (away from the midline of the body), and slightly increasing both finger and bow pressure. (18) For the Largo’s final quadruple stop, the violinist must make technical readjustments to account for not one, but two awkward fifths ( Example 12 ). These adjustments impart an intensification of physical effort that corresponds with the expectancy of the dominant-seventh harmony. Furthermore, on many violins (mine included), the violinist must address a pesky “wolf tone” on the low C4—an act that compounds the player’s effort intensification. (19) To the violinist’s relief, Bach offers a final moment of technical release in the concluding tonic resolution. The final triple stop includes an open A, so the violinist needs to use only two left-hand fingers. Additionally, to delicately shape the plaintive E-string F5 in the final tonic, the player will likely lighten up the bow arm from the previous weighty dominant. One final time, physical tension and release map onto harmonic tension and release.",

In his essay on the Largo in Volume I of Das Meisterwerk in der Musik , Heinrich Schenker ( 1925a , 156–59) offers performance recommendations that, at first blush, conflict with string-based violinistic affordances. Three significant PACs in the Largo intersect with violinistic affordances in radically different ways. The way each cadence sits on the violin suggests how the violinist might play that cadence—the first with effort (likely loud), the second with expansiveness (also loud), and the third with delicacy (soft). Schenker, on the other hand, recommends that the violinist play the cadences at forte , mezzo forte , and forte dynamics, respectively. The mismatch between a violinist’s and Schenker’s perspectives are rooted in the differences between technique and interpretation. Though the violin itself invites certain ways of shaping each cadence, a violinist may recruit tools in their technical arsenal to convey an interpretation that more closely resembles Schenker’s dynamic suggestions. In the recorded performances of the Largo to be discussed below, however, all four violinists highlight the second cadence (the PAC in ii) much more than the other two. These real-world performance examples attest to the significance of string-based violinistic affordances in shaping violinists’ interpretive choices. Three Cadences on the Violin",

The three strong PACs in the Largo—the PAC in V on the downbeat of m. 8, the PAC in ii on the downbeat of m. 13, and the PAC in I on the downbeat of m. 18—are no exception (see again Example 1). Registral and textural contrasts between the three cadences invite the violinist to approach each cadence differently. The triple-stop PAC in V requires that the violinist work against the instrument’s natural resonance. On this chord, the violinist places three fingers down on the lower three strings. The low, covered register, the absence of open strings, and the wolf-tone-prone Cs make it difficult for the violinist to produce a clear, ringing sound. Though they may invest a fair amount of energy into this arrival, the performer’s effort may not directly translate into a robust sound.",

The G-minor tonic of this cadence “carries a hint of monumentality, even within the restricted dimensions of a lone violin” ( Cumming 2000 , 85). (22) Not only is the chord the first quadruple stop, but it features the first open G, includes both the open D and G strings, and covers the widest simultaneous registral span of the entire movement. Especially on the heels of the harmonic and technical intensity of the previous few measures, these features impart both a physical and sonic sense of release and exhale. The G-minor quadruple stop thus invites the violinist to revel in the cadential arrival, perhaps by adding some rubato or boosting the dynamic. In this case, the violinist works with—rather than against—the resonance of the violin. Example 13 .

Although the passage preceding the PAC in I (mm. 16–17) recalls the passage preceding the earlier PAC in V (mm. 6–7), the texture is significantly different ( Example 13 ). Because Bach transposes the earlier passage’s reappearance down by fifth, the F3 needed for an exact cadential mapping lies outside the violin’s playable range. Could the single-note PAC in I simply be a result of instrumental practicality? Perhaps. Nonetheless, the singular cadential texture might affect the violinist’s interpretive choices. The violinist might, for instance, highlight the fragility of the single-note PAC by decreasing in dynamic and sweetening the tone. The way each PAC sits on the violin seems to ask something of the performer, whether it be how much effort to invest, how much rubato to incorporate, or how to shape dynamics around the cadential arrival. In other words, performance technique—shaped by instrumental affordances—affects performance interpretation. How do aspects of performance technique in turn play into analytical perspectives?

He analyzes the movement as unfolding a “fundamental octave-line” that “divides into two segments” ( Schenker 1925a , 141). Within this overarching structure, each of the three significant PACs serves a specific role. The PAC in V concludes the first segment with an Urlinie arrival on 5 ˆ ; the PAC in I concludes the second segment with an arrival on 1 ˆ . The PAC in ii, however, is subsumed into a lengthy prolongation of 4 ˆ . At the highest level, Schenker reads the G-minor cadence as essentially passing in nature, made consonant as the “dividing upper fifth” ( Oberquintteiler ) of C ( Schenker 1925a , 143). (23) The chordal texture of Schenker’s background graph matches that of Bach’s score for the PACs in V and I (C4–E4–C5 and F4, respectively). The complete violinistic texture of the PAC in ii (G3–D4– B ♭ 4–G5), on the other hand, first appears in Schenker’s second diminutional level.

In Example 15 , I have annotated the Largo with dynamic markings that show Schenker’s primary and inner shadings. At the primary level, Schenker indicates that both segments of the movement ought to follow a piano – crescendo – forte progression; the violinist should play both section-concluding cadences (the PAC in V and the PAC in I) forte ( Schenker 1925a , 157–58). (24) He only mentions the PAC in ii when he proceeds to the inner dynamic shadings. Although Schenker also suggests that the violinist crescendo towards the G-minor cadence, he insists that this crescendo lead “only to a mezzo forte .” His reasoning: “In the second section, in terms of the fundamental structure . . . the G triad functions only as a dividing fifth of V. In other words, the events of bars 10–13 must not be equated with the two cadences of a higher order that occur in bars 6–7 and 16–17, for no other cadences have as much weight as these” ( Schenker 1925a , 158).

By contrast, the single-note PAC in I—for which Schenker suggests a forte dynamic—suggests a delicate, perhaps even intimate, cadential arrival. The PAC in V, though thicker-textured than the PAC in I, does not resonate well on the instrument, thereby potentially reducing its dynamic power in performance. It should be noted that Schenker’s practice of systematizing dynamics according to structural levels appears in his writings only occasionally ( Burkhart 1983 , n13).

But steeped as he was in early twentieth-century ideals of the musical work, Schenker downplays the importance of the physical production of sound in favor of preserving the work’s “conceptual integrity.” (27) This is not to say that Schenker never addresses granular technical concerns. In his writings on piano music, he often discusses issues of fingering in great detail—after all, Schenker himself was a pianist ( Siegel 2015 , 265; Bungert 2017 , [4.6]; Rothstein 1984 ).

A violinist’s technique-based perspective may not be at odds with Schenker’s analytical one as much as it initially seems. In his incomplete, posthumously published treatise The Art of Performance (“Die Kunst des Vortrags”), Schenker clarifies that forte and piano are not always measures of “ quantity in a purely physical sense” (i.e., loudness), but of expressive (“psychological”) “quality.” He explains that “occasionally forte can be interpreted as having emotional resonance and piano as being less the low point of a physical quantity than an intimate utterance” ( Schenker 2000 , 39). Schenker’s commentary suggests that dynamics fall within the realms of both the performer’s creation and the listener’s perception. In the case of the Largo, the violinist may recruit tools in their technical arsenal to affect how listeners perceive the dynamic of each cadence. They might play with the speed or distribution of chordal breaks, increase or decrease time spent on arrivals, or highlight moments through non-sound-producing physical motions. Thus, even if the volume of the PAC in ii exceeds that of the PACs in V and in I, a violinist might strategically employ multiple techniques that would ultimately downplay the G-minor cadence from a listener’s perspective.",

With this in mind, a violinist may end up making dynamic decisions that more closely align with Schenker’s recommendations. For example, even though the open strings of the G-minor PAC afford immense instrumental resonance, they also require little prompting from the bow to activate the sound. As such, a violinist might impart a sense of transparency to the thickly textured chord by rolling through the entire quadruple stop without ever playing two notes simultaneously. To create a robust PAC in V, a violinist might break the triple stop into two parts, draw out the C in the lower register, use lots of bow, or add a few extra wiggles of vibrato.

(Hahn’s Largo clocks in at around 4 minutes and 24 seconds, while Heifetz’s only lasts 2 minutes and 36 seconds.) Podger takes a historically informed approach, both with her instrumental setup—gut strings, a Baroque bow, and A415 tuning—and her stylistic choices. Hadelich strikes a middleground: he plays on a modern setup with a Baroque bow and takes a tempo nearly as slow as Hahn’s. However, his stylistic choices more closely resemble Podger’s. For example, Hadelich clearly articulates the beginning of each slur, then slightly lifts the bow out of the string as the slurs subside. Through this subtle bow-arm shaping, Hadelich invites a certain lightness and breath into his sound. Example 16 .

Each violinist allows the low open strings of the G-minor PAC to ring in their full glory, painting the moment as the expressive climax of the Largo. But each violinist uses a unique combination of techniques to achieve this interpretive effect. For example, Hadelich and Podger break the chord 1+1+2 after lingering on the low G, whereas Hahn and Heifetz break the chord 2+2 and approach the cadence with a highly continuous tone. Even though Hahn emphasizes the PAC in I more than the other performers do, the PAC in ii still functions as the dramatic high point in her performance.

For example: How closely should violinists follow the slur markings in Bach’s autograph manuscript? Should triple and quadruple stops always be played on down bows? When is it okay to sneak in a “hooked” bowing or two? In what might be considered a “bowing originalist” stance, eminent violinist Christian Tetzlaff suggests that performers follow Bach’s markings as closely as possible: “Some of the bowings look very difficult—like when you have eight notes in one stroke with a single note against it; but this is what gives the music its shape. For decades people have changed the bowings to make it apparently easier to play, but the only way to get the shape of the phrases right is to do what Bach wrote” (qtd. in Mellor 2017 , 31). Not all violinists agree with Tetzlaff. Though Laurie Niles ( 2019 ) acknowledges the importance of studying Bach’s manuscript, she takes a more flexible approach to Bach’s markings. In Niles’s words, “You don’t have to use Bach’s original bowings, but seeing them can help you think about Bach’s apparent intentions, and how you can reflect those intentions even when you choose different bowings” ( 2019 ). Although their specific philosophies differ, Tetzlaff and Niles share a conviction that bowings are a technical foundation upon which interpretive meaning—in this case, the composer’s intention—is laid.

The binary movements of bowing make it possible to map bowing patterns through a process that resembles rhythmic reduction. In other words, performance technique generates analytical method. For example, even though the three musical gestures in Example 17 differ melodically and rhythmically, they each require the same bowing pattern: a down bow that lasts three times as long as the subsequent up bow. My bowing reduction of the Largo reveals a recurrent bowing-based motive that establishes bodily connections for the violinist across the movement.

Though the full motive only appears once more—at the beginning of the B section (m. 8), when Bach transposes the opening measure into the dominant—its immediate repetition in the first two measures highlights its importance. Following the full-length versions that open the Largo, the motive shortens across the first phrase. At the beginning of m. 3, the medium-length version surfaces; now only two eighth notes follow the dotted eighth + sixteenth. On beat 3, the motive restarts with another dotted eighth + sixteenth, but this time it shortens further, fragmenting into separate sixteenth notes that lead into m. 4. In m. 4, this shortest version of the motive reappears before the phrase gently draws to a close. Across the movement, the medium-length version of the motive occurs eight times, the short version, nine. (31) The bowing-based motivic thread winds its way through key changes, sequential passages, and registral contrasts, weaving an intricate web of technique-based connections across the Largo.",

The motive’s initial rhythmic kernel (the dotted eighth + sixteenth) saturates the first several bars, appearing on each of the first four downbeats and on the third beat of m. 3. A violinist will likely be inclined to play a down bow on the dotted eighth note and an up bow on the sixteenth. Because classical violin pedagogy tends to associate down bows with strong beats, the drawn-out down bow of the rhythmic kernel imparts a feeling of articulating a starting point. The shorter up bow, on the other hand, suggests a continuation. The beginning-oriented dotted eighth + sixteenth imparts an initiating impetus to the motive in each of its various guises. As the movement progresses, the motive appears more frequently in its medium and short versions, which further reinforces its beginning role. The Bowing-Based Motive and an Interpretive Challenge",

Do I relax into beat 3, or do I forge ahead into the expressive upper-register sequence? These two approaches seem contradictory. The bowing-based reduction reveals the source of the tension between them. Beat 3 of m. 10 simultaneously encapsulates two contradictory impulses: the beginning impetus of the bowing-based motive and the ending sense of a local-level, quasi-cadential gesture. In the middle of the bar, the beginning-oriented motive reappears in its medium-length version after two measures of absence. The motive repeats twice more, unfolding an expressive sequence rife with crunchy seventh chords and sighing neighbor-tone figures (mm. 11–12). Simultaneously with the motive’s reappearance, the first sequence of the passage briefly comes to rest on G minor. In isolation, beats 2 and 3 of m. 10 appear to outline the cadential content of an IAC. At the phrase level, however, the juxtaposed sequences and the callback to the sequence of m. 5 dissuade a reading that characterizes this moment as projecting cadential function ( Caplin 2004 , 82). (32) The tension embedded in this moment, then, surfaces at the local level: the momentary sense of ending at the close of the first sequence conflicts with the initiating impulse of the bowing-based motive.

A violinist’s decision to prioritize either the ending sense of the G-minor resting point or the beginning sense of the bowing-based motive affects the shaping of each subsequent two-beat grouping ( Example 21 ). To downplay the beginning impetus of the motive, the violinist might relax into the end-oriented G-minor resting point with some rubato or a slight decrescendo . In this case, the single sixteenth notes that lead into beats 2 and 4 reinvigorate each new grouping and shape the two-beat gestures across the bar (beats 4+1 and 2+3 group together). Alternatively, the violinist could inject the phrase with the initiatory momentum of the motive, perhaps by increasing the weight in the bow to emphasize beats 1 and 3 (beats 1+2 and 3+4 group together). In this case, the violinist downplays the ending sense of the G-minor resting point. (33)",

As can be seen in Video Example 5 , Hahn prioritizes the G-minor resting point, but she varies the amount of time between each subsequent two-beat group. In m. 10, Hahn significantly slows down toward the B ♭ 4 of the G-minor arrival. She then reanimates the tempo on the pickup to beat 4. In m. 11, she prolongs the last sixteenth of the slurs in beats 1 and 3, echoing the rubato she introduced on the G-minor ending gesture. In the second half of the measure, Hahn pushes ahead towards the low-register dominant (m. 12, beat 1) to prepare the impending G-minor PAC. By contrast, Hadelich spares little time for the G-minor resting point of m. 10 ( Video Example 6 ). He instead highlights the beginning-oriented motive by emphasizing the seventh chords on beats 1 and 3 of m. 11. Like Hahn, Hadelich also treats each two-beat group slightly differently. He lingers on the downbeat of m. 11 with a full dynamic and a strong chordal break, but as he approaches beat 3, he slows down and softens the dynamic. On beat 3 itself, Hadelich rolls through the dissonant chord, coloring it with a hushed air of introspective melancholy. In my own playing, I prefer to slightly stretch the G-minor resting point, group the cross-bar two-beat gestures with dynamic hairpins leading towards and away from beats 1 and 3, and maintain the overall momentum of the phrase until the arrival of the expansive G-minor quadruple stop.

                "text": "[4.9] Although Bach’s notated articulations in the Largo suggest clear motivic connections, a performer’s bowing choices need not—and likely will not—hew to these markings. Violinists take into account many factors when making bowing choices, including instrumental setup (historical or modern), stylistic preference, violinistic comfort, tempo, and so on. In making bowing choices that differ from markings in Bach’s autograph, a violinist might instantiate or cut across the motivic connections embedded in Bach’s notation, creating new patterns and structures in the process. Analysts could construct bowing reductions of specific performances or of different editions of the Largo, thereby creating a constellation of bowing-based structural possibilities for the movement. The bowing reduction reminds us how attending to performers’ technical concerns can both enrich our analytical tools and elucidate our interpretive choices. Conclusion",

He knew how seemingly germane compositional choices—such as a movement’s key—can profoundly impact the relationships between technique, instrumental affordances, structure, and harmony. For instance, had he composed the Largo in G instead of F, Bach could have added a decisive lower octave to the structural PAC on the downbeat of m. 18—but at the expense of the low open strings in the off-tonic quadruple stop in m. 13. Bach may have woven such connections between technique, structure, and harmony through the fabric of the Largo as an intimate communication with the performer ( Cusick 1994 , 19–20). Whether or not Bach consciously intended such connections, the undeniably violinistic sensibility of the Largo invites us to consider how performance technique might play a part in our analytical endeavors.",

This attention to technique carries implications for musical contexts beyond the Largo. In addition to applying the multiple-stop intensity model to other solo string works, analysts might consider how intensity manifests for other instruments. The wide range of transcriptions of Bach’s solo string works—for lute, organ, marimba, trombone, and so on—provide ample opportunity for investigating this question. We might also consider how voice-leading practices intersect with instrumental affordances. Could alternate ways of sketching the Largo in fact highlight the G-minor arrival? Analysts might apply the bowing reduction method to scores or performances of works with either articulation-based or phrase-based slurs. How do different performers navigate such markings, and how do different bowing choices bring out different structural possibilities? Attending to the technical concerns of performers across a wide range of instruments will further proliferate technique-sensitive methodologies and enrich the ways in which performance and analysis mutually inform one another.",

Furthermore, listeners watching a performance might understand a performer’s interpretive decisions not only through the sound itself, but also through the performer’s body language.
