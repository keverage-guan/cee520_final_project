    "abstract": "This article revisits the issue of perceived meter in rhythmically irregular post-tonal music by way of Danuta Mirka’s (2009) dynamic model of meter. Her model, which is a parallel multiple-analysis processor in the sense of Jackendoff (1991), accounts for rapidly fluctuating sensations of meter in the real-time listening process, while maintaining local regularity as a defining feature of metric processing. I offer two extensions to her model—one concerning the perceptual processing of non-isochronous meter and the other concerning meter in multiple perceptual streams—along with applications to music by Carter, Webern, Barber, Babbitt, Feldman, and Adès.",

By contrast, Roeder ( 1994 ) offers an entirely new pulse-stream methodology for Schoenberg’s music, later applying it to Bartók’s music ( 2001 ; 2004 ).",

Like local time-units arising from surface durations, pulse streams are “a series of successive, equal timespans, marked off by accented timepoints” (233–34) and are proto-metric ( Roeder 2004 , 46). As with projection, “every pulse must be consistent with actual attacks in the passage,” and pulse streams need not match the notated meter ( Roeder 1994 , 234). Just as local time-units or projections may fluctuate in coordination with surface durations, pulse streams come and go as rhythmic cues fluctuate. Two main differences between Roeder’s ( 1994 ; 2001 ; 2004 ) studies and mine are that his examples always feature a clearly articulated low-level pulse that is common to competing pulse streams, and his analytical application involves keeping track of individual pulse streams as defined entities that can be departed from and returned to. By contrast, my examples do not always feature a common low-level pulse (though some do), and my application of Mirka’s model focuses on the local perceptual effects of fluctuating projections, making no assumption that the listener keeps track of projections over long spans of time.",

They argue that “strong beats will be heard wherever there are appropriate local details” and that this lack of regularity curtails the predictive framework necessary for syncopation. On the other end of the spectrum, Leong ( 2011 ) theorizes syncopation against a broad range of irregular metric structures, presumably all with equal salience. The present model instead suggests that syncopation is a local sensation resulting from a conflict between projection and incoming metric cues.

In light of this critique, I see no obvious reason, other than the issue of cognitive load, to assume that PMAP ever stops elaborating well-formed alternatives. The problem of cognitive load is lessened if we assume a scrolling window of time within which retrospective reinterpretation can occur.

However, as Malin ( 2008 , 61) observes, “a listener who does not have a score and does not know the song hears only a regular pulse.” Only with a score and prior hearing of the passage will listeners “have supplied the missing pulse internally.” Thus, Malin’s observations actually support PMAP’s generative rule. The listener without score or prior knowledge of the song would have exactly the sort of fast, automatic, and reflex-like perceptions for which PMAP aims to account. Even the listener with score and prior knowledge has to put in effort to hear the passage as syncopated.

In light of this hearing, it might be plausible to incorporate the conservative/radical dichotomy as a preference rule, in the form of: prefer to maintain a metric structure once it is established. In a conservative mode of listening, this preference rule is strongly weighted. In a radical mode of listening, this preference rule is weakly weighted and easily overruled by other preference rules.

In typical formulations of isochronous meter—including Example 4—well-formedness rules function like a filter, through which only well-formed combinations pass. Preference rules are then applied to determine a best fit among only the well-formed options. By contrast, here the two types of rules intermix, as the non-isochronous level is deduced in the first place through preference rules (see step 3). Hence, among other modifications to be discussed later, Example 23 will incorporate an additional two-way arrow between the initial processor and the selection function.

The notion that non-isochronous levels “come along for the ride” sits well with London’s ( [2004] 2012 , 128–29) well-formedness conditions, which stipulate that non-isochronous levels can arise only in association with a larger isochronous level. Specifically, for inter-onset intervals (IOIs) on the N cycle to be non-isochronous, the beat cycle must be isochronous (WFC 4.1.1). For IOIs on the beat cycle to be non-isochronous, the IOIs on the N cycle must be isochronous (WFC 4.2.1). In addition, the cycle itself is assumed to be isochronous. In the case of Example 11, the N cycle corresponds to the eighth-note level and is isochronous, the beat cycle corresponds to the alternating triple and duple beats and is non-isochronous, and the full cycle corresponds to the quintuple level and is isochronous.",

As stated before, the reason is that all relevant levels have already been subconsciously confirmed. This brings up an important methodological point related to the use of projective arrows to represent perceived meter. Dotted versus solid arrows only represent a distinction in the subconscious stages of projection formation. They do not represent a distinction in conscious perception. For example, if a projection that is shown with dotted and solid arrows surfaces, such as the quintuple projection at the beginning of Example 9, then the argument is that the corresponding metric level is heard as structuring the beginning but in retrospect from whatever point the metric level actually surfaces. In this case, that point in time is as early as the onset of Unit 2 but not sooner. Additionally, the presence of a solid arrow does not necessarily indicate a surfaced level—it only indicates that that level is subconsciously confirmed and available for surfacing. Hence, multiple non-nesting solid arrows are shown with Unit 2, even though, in my hearing, only the quintuple level surfaces. It is entirely possible that another listener might hear this duple level momentarily replace the quintuplet level. Relatedly, the resetting of the quintuple level at the beginning of Unit 4, shown with solid arrows, does not necessarily indicate that the listener perceives 4 5 meter at the outset of Unit 4. Rather, that perception is again retrospective, from whatever point the new quintuple level surfaces. Because that level has already been subconsciously elaborated, it can surface sooner than the corresponding level at the beginning of the passage. Such are the difficulties of conveying retrospective, in-time, and prospective hearings of meter with a single notational method, particularly when such perceptions fluctuate. For an excellent discussion of the multi-dimensional nature of meter perception in a different context and using a different notational approach, see Temperley 2008 , 312–14.",

I am simply pointing out that a non-isochronous 4 5 hearing is not only possible from the perspective of PMAP but likely, depending upon the extent to which one’s weighting of preference rules surfaces a quintuple projection at the beginning.

This same distinction has been made by Temperley ( 2008 ) in the context of hypermeter, and it counters the traditional view that Carter’s metric modulations are necessarily gradual and seamless. What is perceptually gradual is the filling-out of new subdivisions across measures 7–8, where dotted eighths and dotted sixteenths are gradually introduced.

Though originally designed for tonal music, Mirka’s model is especially well-suited to post-tonal music because of its ability to account for rapidly fluctuating sensations of meter in the real-time listening process while still maintaining local regularity as a defining feature of metric processing. The model accounts for perceptions that arise spontaneously, without reference to the notated barline, and usefully hypothesizes a lower threshold for perceived meter. This threshold enables a fine-grained distinction between musical surfaces that are at least somewhat metric (because they engage metric processing at least to some degree) and those that are truly ametric (because they persistently subvert one or more aspects of such processing).",

About a prior performance of the piece, he recalls: Simply in order to play the right notes at the right time, I had to learn to hear my own part as well as all the other parts in the texture in a metric framework—the notated one. In effect, I had to memorize a silent click-track for the piece—a click-track against which the rhythms played out their jazzy syncopations and crossrhythms . . . . I must have rather thoroughly memorized that metric grid, for if I listened to the concert tape not long after performing the piece, I could easily hear it automatically in the notated meter . . . But I can also remember well my surprise some months later when I listened again to the tape. In the interim, I had forgotten the measure-by-measure metric structure of the piece. And what had seemed to me in my days of familiarity a rhythmic-metric structure of crystalline clarity had become thoroughly opaque. Seemingly erratic impulses dominated the soundscape. Did an audience, any audience, hear only this latter piece and never the one that I had striven so hard to perform? ( Lester 1986 , 117)",

I am not sure that I can contribute at this time to an approach to these issues that does not rely on assuming such a one-to-one relationship between notated symbol and perceived duration. But I am convinced that until we as theorists can create a model that solves this problem, we will have failed to systematically address temporal aspects of this music in a manner that accords with our hearing of the music.

Namely, repeating durations within each individual line, and not the beats of the notated meter, project the passage’s “mensural character” ( Lewin 1987 , 62). While Lewin avoids the term “meter,” presumably to theorize mensuration and tempo as distinct from the notated meter, as well as to bypass contestable claims about perceived beat or metric hierarchy, his notion of autonomous local time-unit is nevertheless proto-metric, insofar as it carves out periodic regularities from perceived rhythmic cues. Lewin’s autonomous local time-unit is therefore a plausible foundation for a theory of perceived meter independent from the notated one. (8) Example 1 .

In Mirka’s adaptation, projection is schematized as in Example 1 . Given two attacks on the musical surface (A1 and A2), the time interval between them (dotted arc) functions as a hypothesis (dotted arrow) for the location of a third attack. If that hypothesis is fulfilled (A3), then the projected timespan is confirmed. It becomes the basis for further projection (solid arrow) and generates beats or pulses (dots), terms I use interchangeably. If, on the other hand, the hypothesis is not fulfilled and a third attack does not occur at the anticipated moment, then the projection is denied. It does not become the basis for further projection and does not generate beats. Under this formulation, the presence of three regularly spaced attacks functions as the lower threshold for the perceptual formation of a level of beats. (9) The dots of Example 1 are not felt as beats until the moment in time when A3 confirms the projection. Hence, meter in its earliest stages arises retrospectively, even though projection is fundamentally prospective. Example 2 .

Simply put, theorists disagree about the extent to which meter must be regular. Some require strict regularity, with irregularity arising at hypermetric levels through transformation rules ( Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 ; Benjamin 1984 ). Others permit meter to be aperiodic if it satisfies certain well-formedness constraints that model repeating non-isochronous structures ( London [2004] 2012 ) or if aperiodicity is driven by motive ( Horlacher 1995 ). Still others allow meter to be more substantially irregular ( Berry 1987 ; Kramer 1988 ; Leong 2011 ). (11) The disagreement is generally a matter of definition, which I have argued is better framed from a perceptual perspective: “are the various percepts associated with periodic meter, as well as the mental processes giving rise to them, the same as those associated with ostensible aperiodic metric structures?” ( Sullivan 2021 , 125). Finally, some treat regularity as repertoire-dependent ( Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 ; Lerdahl 1992 ; Temperley 2001 ), a view supported by a handful of empirical studies that address meter perception and enculturation ( Hannon and Trehub 2005a and 2005b ; Hannon, Soley, and Ullal 2012 ).

                "text": "[2.8]\tWhile I cannot hope to reconcile these competing positions, one piece of introspective evidence supports the idea that meter is constrained by regularity in some fashion. It is a phenomenon I call the pop-out effect , which David Temperley ( 2001 , 301) has described as follows: “even when a piece has established a norm of being completely nonmetrical, we will immediately notice any suggestion of a beat or regular pulse.” (12) Example 3 , which gives some of the prior context for Example 2, is instructive in this regard. The opening cello solo, while not entirely nonmetrical, is certainly metrically unstable. The sudden and sustained regularity of the second violin’s pizzicatos pops out of this context with a new pulse. The perception is immediate and seems to require no special effort on the part of the listener. (13) While Temperley adduces the pop-out effect as evidence that meter processing is always in operation and does not simply turn off in response to irregular metric cues, the pop-out effect also serves as evidence that meter perception is constrained by regularity in some way. If instead meter processing freely generated regular and irregular metric structures, then no pop-out effect would exist at all. The entire passage would be experienced as equally metric throughout. Thus, not only is meter processing always in operation, it must also always be seeking regularity. (14) Such “seeking” is well captured by the mechanism of projection. Irregular fluctuations and non-isochronous metric structures may very well arise in response to rhythmic irregularity—I will argue that certain ones do—but they must arise from a projective process that attempts to establish regularity in the first place. Thus, Mirka’s model offers something of a middle ground in the debate over regularity: meter must be regular at a local anticipative level, while the larger metric structures that arise from such anticipative regularity may be irregular.

However, while real-time processing and final-state understanding are obviously related, I see no reason to assume outright that they are constrained in the same ways. My adaptation of Mirka’s model suggests that a final-state analysis can be irregular—sometimes substantially so—while the processing that leads to that structure demands greater regularity. Among other things, this distinction has important implications for the formalization of non-isochronous meters. It suggests that accounting for such structures is not just a matter of refining well-formedness constraints, as London ( [2004] 2012 ) does. Rather it is also a matter of articulating how the listener might integrate the relevant irregularities into an anticipative projective process that is otherwise strictly regular.",

The idea that perceptions can pop out without the listener’s intent to have those perceptions in the first place is consistent with the idea that music perception generally, and meter perception in particular, is modular . (17) Among other things, modularity holds that perceptual processing is reflex-like—fast, obligatory, domain-specific, and informationally encapsulated. For the real-time perception of meter, these principles mean that as a passage unfolds, the mind rapidly and automatically assigns it a metric structure (i.e., is fast and obligatory) based on (and only on) whatever metric cues the music currently presents (i.e., is domain-specific) without conscious effort on the part of the listener and independent of any “outside,” conscious knowledge about the passage (i.e., is informationally encapsulated). While modularity has been hotly debated since Jerry Fodor’s ( 1983 ) original outline (see, for instance, Barrett and Kurzban 2006 ), it nevertheless accounts for the pop-out effect and is a useful framework for thinking about meter perception. Furthermore, I would argue that we need not invoke all aspects of modularity—such as strict encapsulation—to adopt some of them—such as speed and obligatoriness. Indeed, without explicitly referring to modularity, London ( [2004] 2012 , 68) describes meter perception as “automatic and subliminal” while observing that trained musicians can “self-consciously reconstrue a rhythmic surface.” Thus meter processing for London is obligatory but not strictly encapsulated.",

(19) The fundamental feature of such a processor is that, as a passage unfolds, the processor simultaneously generates all well-formed analytical structures—in our case, metric structures—subject to certain constraints. In other words, the processor generates multiple analyses in parallel (hence “parallel multiple-analysis processor”). It does so automatically, and the analyses are subconscious at this stage of processing. When sufficient evidence, in the form of preference rules , supports one meter above the others, the processor’s selection function chooses that meter as the preferred one and surfaces it to consciousness. The chosen meter becomes the perceived meter and interprets musical events in the immediate past, present, and future. Non-preferred analyses are maintained subconsciously even if they do not surface. This enables retrospective reinterpretation (or retrospective reanalysis , to use Jackendoff’s word), whereby any well-formed alternative can supplant the surfaced meter if appropriately cued by phenomenal accents.

For a definite sense of meter to arise as a passage unfolds and for retrospective reinterpretation to be possible, meter processing must either (1) commit to a single metric structure and, when prompted to make a reinterpretation, backtrack to try out alternative meters in succession; or (2) generate all well-formed meters simultaneously and choose among them. The former is called a serial single-choice processor ; the latter is a PMAP. (20) Jackendoff favors a PMAP in part because the serial single-choice model places high demands on processing speed: backtracking must keep up with the pace of the music. With a PMAP, the demands of processing speed are replaced with demands of processing space: multiple analyses must be computed simultaneously rather than successively. Jackendoff prefers a PMAP but acknowledges that the tradeoff is difficult to evaluate. Similarly, Temperley ( 2001 , 209), whose computational model is also a PMAP, cautions against dismissing a serial single-choice model, since “it is possible, for example, that the system is backtracking, but is just doing it so quickly and effortlessly that we do not notice.” I follow Jackendoff and Mirka in adopting a PMAP as the most viable model.

Metric hierarchy is generated by the simultaneous projection of nesting timespans. As shown in Example 5 , an interval spanning the first and third attacks (A1 and A3) prompts a higher-level projection that itself is either confirmed or denied by a subsequent attack (A5). The confirmation of this larger projection (A5) functions as a lower threshold for what is traditionally thought of as meter. Given a musical surface that articulates one lower level of regularity, Example 6 shows all projections that could define a duple or triple metric hierarchy, with all phases shown. Because PMAP is a parallel multiple-analysis processor, these levels and phases are all elaborated subconsciously, and this is true every time PMAP encounters an isochronous series of attacks that functions as a unit level. It is up to the selection function to choose one nested hierarchy to surface to consciousness at a given time. (21)",

With respect to Example 5, PMAP predicts that, at the moments when A1 and A2 occur, we do not yet have a definite experience of pulse. After A3 occurs but before A5 occurs, we have a sense of pulse for everything up to the moment in question (assuming the selection function surfaces that beat level), but we do not yet have a definite sense of metric hierarchy. Only after A5 occurs do we have a definite sense of metric hierarchy (again assuming that the selection function surfaces that particular beat level). The process continues up the metric hierarchy, with each successively higher level confirmed one after the other and at proportionally wider and wider timespans. In this way, the perception of meter at the beginnings of pieces is always both retrospective and gradual. (22)",

This hypothesis results in two stages of meter, which she calls “finding meter” and “monitoring meter,” after London’s ( [2004] 2012 , 67–72) distinction between “finding the meter” and “keeping the meter going.” Temperley ( 2009 , 310–11) critiques this hypothesis for a number of reasons, and I similarly do not adopt it. (23) Thus, in my formulation, PMAP is always in a state of meter finding. In the case of rhythmically irregular post-tonal music where meter constantly fluctuates, it often would be anyway. This assumption means that metric reinterpretation is swifter in my model than in Mirka’s. Instead of needing to “wake up” to restart the projective process and in turn overcome a series of three-attack thresholds, PMAP is already prepared to replace the surfaced meter with any projective hierarchy that has been subconsciously elaborated. The analytical consequence is that such later-surfaced hierarchies will sometimes appear immediately as solid arrows, whereas in Mirka’s model they might appear as a series of dotted arcs, dotted arrows, and solid arrows.",

First and foremost are the attacks on the musical surface: until a projection has been confirmed, projection can only operate on actual attacks. As Mirka ( 2009 , 25–27) notes, this assumption simplifies meter finding. In other models ( Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 ; Jackendoff 1991 ), initially syncopated metrical analyses are well-formed possibilities that are typically discarded by the metrical preference rule (MPR) that attacks should coincide with strong beats (Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s MPR 3). Projection bypasses such analyses and treats this preference rule as the model’s fundamental generative rule. (24) Equally, any pair of attacks within certain temporal thresholds initiate a projection that has the potential to be confirmed. This obligatory processing conforms with Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s ( 1983 ) metrical well-formedness rule (MWFR) 1, whereby “every attack point must be associated with a beat at the smallest metrical level present at that point in the piece.” Recast in terms of projection, every attack point necessarily initiates a projective search for a second attack, which in turn has the potential to generate beats with a third attack.

Drawing from Hasty 1997 and London [2004] 2012 , Mirka outlines a range of 0.2–2.0 seconds for initial projections ( 2009 , 32–33) and an upper limit of 5–6 seconds for hypermeter ( 2021 , 46), both of which I adopt. Under this rubric, A1 and A2 in Example 5 would need to be 0.2–2.0 seconds apart to induce projection, while A1 and A3 need only be less than 6 seconds apart to induce the larger projection. Were there no intervening A2, then A1 and A3 would need to be 0.2–2.0 seconds apart to induce the same projection. In this manner, smaller projections substantially facilitate the induction of larger projections with which they align.

(31) They typically include a variety of phenomenal accents, such as dynamic stress, durational stress, textural accentuation, melodic peaks, change of bass, and change of harmony, all of which prefer to be aligned with strong beats. They can also include non-musical cues like prosodic stress, as well as things like the preference for binary regularity, the preference to place strong beats early in a group, and the preference to interpret parallel groups with parallel metric structures.",

That is because melodic parallelism is known to facilitate the perception of meter ( Temperley and Bartlette 2002 ). Mirka ( 2009 ) puts it well: From the assumption that recognition of [melodic] parallelism is tantamount to recognizing patterns as having parallel metrical structure, it follows that the “false” meter is established as soon as the parallelism is recognized. This happens, at the latest, with the completion of the second segment in a given chain of repetitions. (138) Here, Mirka is describing cases in which repeating motivic parallelisms generate a temporary false meter that is different from the established or notated one, but the same principle applies more generally to any case of melodic parallelism. Thus, in rhythmically irregular post-tonal environments, melodic parallelism can facilitate quicker and more rapidly fluctuating sensations of meter than might otherwise arise through the basic operations of PMAP. It can even create exceptions to the three-attack threshold, as will be seen later. Melodic parallelism therefore has privileged status among preference rules.",

Both are essential to account for the fleeting and fluctuating sensations of meter that characterize much post-tonal music. Additionally, while Examples 5 and 6 assumed a pervasive unit level in order to demonstrate parallel processing, such a level is not strictly necessary. All that is needed to induce projection and an accompanying sensation of meter are a few evenly and moderately spaced attacks within a short window of time. This is one of the benefits of PMAP as compared with many other models of meter and is in fact necessary if we are to account for perceived meter in, say, Example 3.

Coming out of the introduction, the melody takes a moment to settle into a meter, speeding up its durations from 7 to 5 to 4. The irregularity of this opening segment C ♯ –D– D ♭ confirms no metric projections, but the faster value 4 becomes the basis for meter through the sustained regularity of the next segment D ♭ –F– A ♭ –G. The sequence 4–4–8–4 surfaces nesting quadruple and octuple projections, generating the line’s strongest sense of meter in conjunction with the line’s registral climax. As the line descends, the durations broaden from 4 to 5, and the tempo subtly slows. Specifically, the F ♯ cuts against both established projections and, together with the prior B, surfaces a new quintuple projection. In a similar manner, the next segment A ♯ – C ♯ cuts against this new projection and resurfaces a quadruple projection, this time leading into the melody’s lowest point. The final segment E–A– D ♯ relaxes from 4 to 6, and its irregular 6–4–5 profile closes the melody with a similar lack of meter with which the melody began. In sum, the melody’s rhythmic fluctuations are coordinated with its two registral extremes—both extremes confirm the same fastest local pulse at the precise moment of their onset.

Example 7 assumes that PMAP can distinguish among quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, and octuple projections, even when the common unit is unarticulated. Yet that assumption should be questioned. In the absence of articulated subdivisions, how fine-grained can projective distinctions be? In Example 7, are the quadruple and quintuple rhythmic values registered as categorically distinct, in which case they generate conflicting sets of projections, or are they registered as categorically equivalent, in which case they generate and reinforce a single projective hierarchy? The answer determines the depth of metric hierarchy and the presence or absence of sensations like syncopation or metrical dissonance. If, as I have assumed, quadruple and quintuple projections are categorically distinct, then each change from one to the other supplants the established metric structure with a new one and generates indirect metrical dissonance. If, on the other hand, quadruple and quintuple projections are categorically equivalent, then each change from one to the other simply continues the established metric structure, generating a subtle push and pull of tempo rather than metrical dissonance. This hearing resonates with Lewin’s ( 1981 ) discussion of observations made by Jeanne Bamberger ( 1976 ) and conforms with John Roeder’s ( 2006 ) notion of “quasi-metric continuity.” Under Roeder’s model, the passage would be perceived as a series of shorts (4 and 5) leading into longs (8 and 6) at the registral extremes. The overall experience of directedness is similar in both hearings, though the perceptual particulars differ. (33) Which of these hearings holds also depends on performative details of absolute tempo and accentuation, in addition to the perceptual categories formed by the listener. I will return to the issue of categorical perception later. (34)",

If the pulses generated by PMAP and thus inferred by the listener are those described above and not those of the notated meter, to what meter should the performer actively entrain? Recall that, in reference to similar melodic lines in Example 2, Lewin ( 1987 , 70) argues in favor of entraining to a line’s “local time-unit,” rather than to a “distantly related notational beat.” In the language of PMAP, that means entraining to the shifting projections of Example 7. While such entrainment would prove difficult in the chamber setting of Carter’s String Quartet no. 1, where each line moves according to its own local time-unit within a larger polymetric configuration, such entrainment is much easier in the solo context of Figment III . For example, the bassist might initially entrain to the notated meter for the introduction, given no strong projective alternative, but then switch to counting the triplet subdivisions shown above the staff in Example 7, overtly feeling a 4-pulse on the D ♭ –F– A ♭ –G segment, a 5-pulse on the B– F ♯ segment, and again a 4-pulse on the A ♯ – C ♯ segment. By actively attending to these shifting metric structures, the bassist can come closer to entraining as a listener would. Such matching facilitates metric communication between performer and listener, insofar as the performer can think, perform, and perceive their own music and performative actions in terms of the meter likely heard by the listener. This approach corresponds to Hasty’s ( 1997 , 209) notion of “playing by ear,” which he acknowledges may involve “some form of counting,” and by which the performer “can communicate a much more vivid and engaging rhythmic/projective sense using all the articulative resources his or her technique provides.”",

This brings up a fourth and final issue having to do with what might be termed passive versus active entrainment . In short, PMAP models passive entrainment, insofar as it aims to account for perceptions that arise automatically in a reflex-like manner. In principle, however, a performer or listener can entrain to whatever pulse they desire, with varying degrees of active effort depending on the context and the given pulse’s relationship to it. The attending sense of meter is present immediately, prior to any three-attack threshold. How does PMAP accommodate active entrainment? One possibility is suggested by John Paul Ito’s ( 2020 ) concept of focal impulse . To entrain to the notated beat, the performer—and I would argue the listener as well—matches focal impulses with the notated beat. Such active entrainment somehow overrides, interacts with, or functions as an input to passive entrainment. Exactly what this interaction might look like is too speculative to warrant extended discussion here. Instead, I simply suggest that focal impulses as a form of active entrainment should be kept in mind as a complicating factor when making introspective judgements about perceived meter.

This latter point suggests a more general one: while smaller projections facilitate larger projections with which they nest, they are not strictly necessary to induce those larger projections. Mirka ( 2009 , 33–35) makes this point in an insightful analysis of the opening of Joseph Haydn’s String Quartet in D Major, op. 50, no. 6 (“The Frog”), where the largest metric level is established first and then gradually filled in by lower levels in coordination with harmonic resolution of an off-tonic opening.

Under traditional formalizations of meter, exemplified by Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s ( 1983 ) definition of metric well-formedness, all but the quintuple subdivision would be considered metric. Yet if the larger level has already been established through projection, as Mirka has shown to be a viable process in common-practice music, why would the sudden presence of a nesting, isochronous level that happens to include five beats instead of two, three, or four beats, suddenly negate the larger level’s metric status? Surely the presence of this new nesting pulse does not suddenly cause the established larger pulse to vanish. Indeed, all pairwise combinations of the larger level with one smaller nesting level pass Maury Yeston’s ( 1976 , 66) definition of meter as, minimally, an interaction between two regular levels of motion, “a constant rate within a constant rate.” Example 9 .

In my hearing of the passage, the largest projection crystallizes first with the onset of Unit 2, carving out the descending chromatic line E ♭ –D– C ♯ and continuing through Unit 3’s accented F. While I hear the quarter-note level briefly surfacing in Unit 1, it quickly dissipates from a lack of subsequent note onsets. This level becomes more firmly established over the course of Unit 2, at which point the larger projection is revealed to be a quintuple grouping of the smaller projection.

The non-isochronous 3+2 patterning is flanked above and below by clearly articulated isochronous pulses. As the model currently stands, PMAP handles the outer levels with no issue. The problem is the intermediate level: differently sized timespans cannot be projected in alternation, at least not directly as a single projective level. Perhaps, instead, this level is deduced from the outer levels. The process might work as follows and as suggested by Example 11 : Both outer levels are projected and eventually confirmed (marked with the rightmost arrow in Stage 1). There is a point in time after the larger timespan has been projected but before it has been confirmed that all duple and triple projections have already been confirmed (marked with the leftmost arrow in Stage 1). There is a point in time between (1) and (2) when PMAP recognizes, through preference rules, that no one established duple or triple level is as well-supported in its entirety as various components and combinations of multiple different duple and triple levels. One of those combinations is best-supported and nests with the larger level (circled in Stage 1). That best-supported combination surfaces to consciousness, or is made available for surfacing, in tandem with the larger level (Stage 2). (36) Thus hypothesized, the intermediate level effectively comes along for the ride, by way of the larger projection. This is represented visually in Stage 2 of Example 11, where the triple and duple timespans are measured together (dotted arcs) and then projected together (dotted arrows) in association with the quintuple level.

These cues grate against both the intermediate and larger levels of the established 8 5 meter. The resulting sense of syncopation or indirect metrical dissonance is possible because two measures of 8 5 are present. Example 14 gives some hypothetical alternatives to Barber’s opening, with the vocal entrances aligned. Were only one measure present, as in the first hypothetical alternative, the intermediate and larger levels would not have a chance to surface, and no conflict would be felt. Instead, the passage would likely begin with a vague sense of meter, before briefly falling into the quarter-note pulse of the 4 2 measure. The same is not true of, say, 8 6 meter, as shown in the second hypothetical alternative. After only one measure of 8 6 meter, the dotted-quarter level would surface, against which the subsequent cues would be dissonant. They would not, however, be dissonant against the larger level, since that level would not have yet surfaced. The extent to which the reader agrees that Barber’s actual opening is more dissonant or syncopated than the second hypothetical alternative, which is in turn more dissonant or syncopated than the first hypothetical alternative, is evidence for or against my proposed extension to PMAP.

For instance, in Example 13, might non-isochronous strong beats be heard wherever there is a bass onset, just as soon as the listener realizes that each bass onset initiates another “oom-pah” pattern? While a stock pattern like this can facilitate meter in a similar way as melodic parallelism, I question whether projective meter can surface quite so rapidly. Specifically, I question whether a proper sense of metric anticipation exists, to the extent that a listener expects the precise location of the next pulse at a given metric level, as opposed to perceiving an accent in the immediate past. I argue that such anticipation is the more important perceptual feature of meter, particularly since accent in the immediate past could conflate metric accent with phenomenal accent. For instance, at the onset of the third or even fourth eighth note in Example 13, do we really have a sense of duple or triple pulse above the eighth-note pulse to the extent that we expect another strong beat two or three eighth notes forward into the future? I do not think I do, and I suspect that is because the only cues for meter at this stage—duple bias and bass onset—are at odds. Furthermore, at the onset of the sixth or seventh eighth note, how could we anticipate the location of the next bass onset or strong beat when they have so far been spaced both two and three eighth notes apart? To my ear, only with the ninth and tenth eighth notes can I begin to anticipate the downbeat on the eleventh eighth note, and only because of the emergence of a larger five-eighth-note parallelism. Thus, while I acknowledge that melodic parallelism and stock patterns might facilitate perceived meter prior to the three-attack threshold (the eleventh eighth note), they do not entirely supplant that threshold.",

                "text": "[4.9]\tThis discussion has pointed to several reasons why listeners might report hearing strong beats sooner than the three-attack threshold. I compile them below, along with several others: Melodic parallelism—a type of intra-opus template matching, melodic parallelism has a facilitating effect on meter. The accompanimental pattern in Example 13 constitutes a melodic parallelism, albeit short and subject to contraction and expansion. Schema, topic, and style—an instance of extra-opus template matching, the “oom-pah” pattern of Example 13 is highly stereotyped and may be sufficient to cue strong beats with each bass onset. (39) Enculturation and metric archetypes—in addition to the top-down, extra-opus cues in (2), meters themselves can function as schematic templates. Those whose musical cultures commonly feature 8 5 rhythmic patterns may more readily impose a 8 5 metric framework than those whose musical cultures do not. (40) Categorical perception—relatedly, those who have formed stable rhythmic categories for 8 5 rhythmic patterns may more readily impose a 8 5 metric framework than those who have not. Categorical perception will be discussed in more detail later. Repeated listening—having heard Example 13 before, a listener might consciously or subconsciously impose 8 5 meter onto the passage prior to the point at which PMAP would have surfaced it in a first hearing. Embodiment, physical performance, and conscious intention—either listener or performer might intentionally hear or perform a passage with a particular meter from the outset, such as through focal impulses ( Ito 2020 ). Furthermore, such intention may fall somewhere along a conscious-subconscious spectrum. Introspection and notation—in attempting to account for one’s own hearing of meter, one might intentionally or unintentionally impose a particular metric hearing. A special case of this, which also intersects with (6), is when introspection occurs with score study, whereby a listener might intentionally or unintentionally impose a notated meter or pulse level. Introspective misjudgment—in Example 13, even though the full non-isochronous metric hierarchy does not surface until the onset of measure 3 (or some slightly earlier moment due to the factors above), regular projections, whose timespans I have hypothesized form the basis of the hierarchy’s irregular level, are confirmed and could surface earlier. Such fleeting regularity could impart a false impression that the non-isochronous hierarchy has surfaced earlier than measure 3. Additionally, as already pointed out, introspection can easily conflate phenomenal accent with metric accent, particularly as concerns perception of accent in the immediate past. Different ways of hearing meter—meter-related percepts range from relatively direct sensations, such as strong and weak beats, to relatively indirect sensations, such as the sense that text stress matches or mismatches its rhythmic setting. The numerous ways of hearing meter can be easily conflated in the process of introspection.",

To the extent that PMAP does account for perceived meter in contexts with fewer complicating factors, such as Example 7, I argue that PMAP is still a viable working hypothesis for a baseline meter processor. Its interactions with other aspects of perceptual processing in turn makes for more precise and testable hypotheses about meter perception generally. (41)",

At this point, we might posit a new regularity rule that accommodates the local irregularity of Example 10, while still maintaining a degree of global regularity. London ( [2004] 2012 , 128–29) takes such an approach through a set of well-formedness constraints that accommodate certain non-isochronous structures. For reasons that will become clear in later examples, I will not follow suit. Instead, regularity continues to be captured by projection. Recasting regularity in this way means that PMAP still exhibits local projective regularity, even in contexts that lack global regularity. (42)",

This time, however, I hear an intermediate level more readily, likely because the unit level is already established and intermediate levels are already confirmed. Specifically, I hear a non-isochronous 3+2 level, which can be explained through the process outlined in Example 11: PMAP recognizes that a 3+2 combination is better supported than any single triple or duple projection, and this intermediate level surfaces with the larger quintuple level, creating a complete 4 5 hierarchy. (44) Thus, my extension to PMAP explains the intuition that I have a less definite sense of 4 5 meter over Units 1–3 but a more definite sense of 4 5 meter over Units 4–6, even though the two sets of units are rhythmically parallel. (45) Over Units 7–8, rhythmic patterning begins to complicate this 4 5 meter, and I hear the notated barline surfacing for the first time, though with a 4 6 organization that continues to obscure the notated 2 3 meter. As a whole, Example 9’s top-down filling-in of the metric hierarchy in conjunction with pitch structure and unit form, leading to an eventual crystallization of the notated barline, makes Webern’s passage a post-tonal analog to the opening of Haydn’s “The Frog,” as discussed in [4.1].",

In particular, the idea that a large beat subdivided into fives is sufficiently metric (Example 8) and the intuition that such a metric structure can organize our listening experience for some time without a strong sense of an intermediate level (Units 1–3 of Example 9) together demand that we drop the well-formedness rule stipulating that beats must be organized hierarchically in twos and threes ( Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 , MWFR 3). Indeed, Lerdahl and Jackendoff ( 1983 , 97) consider this possibility for certain musical idioms, in conjunction with dropping MWFR 4. And yet, the strong sense of 3+2 in Examples 10 and 13, combined with the intuition that an intermediate level eventually emerges in Example 9, suggest that there is still some cognitive pressure to construe meter with as rich a hierarchy as possible, be it isochronous or non-isochronous. Thus, I suggest that MWFR 3 is better conceived as a preference rule, which encourages rather than requires duple or triple hierarchies. While dropping MWFRs 3 and 4 allows for potentially objectionable non-isochronous levels within otherwise isochronous meters—such as a 2+1 level in 4 3 meter or a 3+1 level in 4 4 meter—keeping MWFR 3 as a strong preference rule safeguards against such levels when a subdivision is present. Later, we will return to the possibility of a non-isochronous 2+1 level when a subdivision is absent. Additionally, this recasting of MWFR 3 in turn raises a question as to whether MWFR 4 should also be recast as a preference rule. While doing so is possible, I stop short of adopting this view for the present study, given my emphasis on global metric irregularity. Applying PMAP",

I suggest that any such rhythmic context engages PMAP as outlined, prompting projections wherever there is sufficient local regularity. One useful way of parsing the rhythmic landscape of post-tonal music relative to the mechanisms of PMAP is through the extent and depth of rhythmic regularity. This approach leads to the following categories: music that features both a regular unit level and a regular organization of the unit level, which prompts PMAP to generate a single isochronous or non-isochronous meter throughout; music that features a regular unit level but fluctuating organization of the unit level (i.e., “mixed meter”), which prompts PMAP to generate a constant unit pulse and to surface larger pulses in potentially rapid succession based on the configuration of phenomenal accents; music that features fluctuating but well-articulated unit levels, which prompts PMAP to generate both unit and larger pulses in potentially rapid succession based on the configuration of attacks and phenomenal accents; music that lacks a unit level altogether but features larger fluctuating levels, which prompts PMAP to surface shallower hierarchies than those in (3); and music that lacks any sense of pulse whatsoever (i.e., “ametric music”), which consistently subverts one of the core components of PMAP’s projection mechanism. While this classification is rough, porous, and non-exhaustive—an additional class of irregularity will be considered in the conclusion—it nevertheless represents many common post-tonal rhythmic structures and the ways they engage metric processing.

Furthermore, the passage’s most extreme metric instability, which clusters around the words “secrets” and “now,” conveys an instability in what the speaker presently knows (having “secrets now”). Over the course of the poem, what the speaker knows turns out to be the differences between love in youth and old age. Thus, in Barber’s metrically unstable opening, I can hear already the instability of love that the speaker turns out to have experienced, as well as a degree of hesitance in the speaker’s assertion that all aspects of that past and present love are in fact known.

(47) The first such switch occurs over measures 9–11. After the opening eight measures surface, suppress, and then resurface the notated 8 6 meter, a series of counter-metric accents in measures 9–10 cut against both levels of the 8 6 hierarchy. (48) These accents seem to prompt a new set of projections, shown as beginning at measure 9 with solid arrows. (49) These new projections continue into measures 11–14, where they become the notated 8 6 meter, now with a faster tempo than the beginning of the movement. Measures 9–10 thus function as a metric transition, prompting the new 8 6 hierarchy to surface slightly prior to its notational onset. (50)",

Thus, for instance, the extension from 8 5 to 8 7 at the beginning of measure 17 continues the prior 8 5 meter, while the onset of the next motivic statement in the middle of the measure cuts against that meter and surfaces 8 7 meter, both retrospectively for the 8 7 segment itself and prospectively for the subsequent segment.

Each metric modulation prompts PMAP to surface a new metric structure built from shorter and shorter projections, producing the passage’s sense of local accelerando. As projections shorten, higher-level projections move down into meter’s temporal sweet spot, and perception is gradually drawn up the metric hierarchy.

This type of ameter was suggested by the introduction from Example 7, which avoids confirming all but the very first projection through a process of gradual rhythmic expansion beginning in measure 2. Example 17 , which reproduces the opening clarinet solo from Milton Babbitt’s Composition for Four Instruments along with Lester’s ( 1986 ) rhythmic annotations, achieves the same type of ameter by serializing rhythm at two hierarchical levels with the pattern 1–4–3–2. (54) The patterning is such that for every pair of immediately successive onsets, there is no third onset to confirm a projection. The only larger regularities are the quintuple pairings of 1+4 and 3+2, but the corresponding projections never stabilize beyond a third attack because the unit level keeps changing.

In such cases, inter-onset intervals that are more than twice as long as the marked tempo’s referential rhythmic unit fall outside of the range of initial entrainment, while shorter inter-onset intervals fall within that range. Example 20 gives the opening of For Aaron Copland , marked “quarter equals 56.” The solo violin’s inter-onset intervals hover around the half note, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, thus riding the edge of metric entrainment.

By the same line of reasoning, it follows that PMAP subconsciously elaborates all well-formed metrical structures for each individual perceptual stream, in addition to those elaborated for the composite texture. If not, then retrospective hearing of a particular stream’s meter after an attentional switch to that stream would not be possible.

To answer this objection, another example is needed, specifically one that features competing meters across competing textural layers but that does not articulate a constant and common unit pulse. Recall that Example 2, like Example 22, features multiple textural layers, parsed as distinct perceptual streams. In Example 2, each stream supports its own “autonomous local time-unit,” which we reformulated as projective pulse. Unlike Example 22, there is no articulated unit pulse that is common to any pair of streams. Yet I experience a similar perceptual phenomenon surrounding meter and attentional shift as I do in Example 22. Thus, Lewin’s insights into Example 2, which prefigure essential elements of Mirka’s PMAP, also support my multiple-meter extension.

As historically conceived, triple meter differed from duple meter not in the number of beats each measure contains but in the length of beats. Specifically, triple meter consisted of two beats, with the first beat twice as long as the second.

In practice, the non-isochronous subdivisions from this repertoire are too fast to perceptually infer an isochronous lower level ( Polak and London 2014 , [92]).

                "text": "[7.4]\tIf Examples 24 and 25 truly describe metric experience, then they make two demands of PMAP. First, in addition to the non-isochrony that violates MWFR 4, Example 25 also demands that MWFR 3 be dropped, but for a different reason than Examples 8 and 9 suggest. Namely, the pattern’s final short operates as an indivisible beat appearing at two different levels of subdivision. Unlike the long, the beat does not divide into twos or threes, as MWFR 3 would require. Second, both Examples 24 and 25 stabilize a lowest non-isochronous level without the presence of an even lower isochronous level. This demands that we account for non-isochrony through a different mechanism than hypothesized in Example 11, since there is no lowest isochronous level to prompt the projections that might otherwise make up the non-isochronous level. Polak and London ( 2014 , [117]) put it well: “The non-isochronous metric subdivisions of Ngòn and Bire challenge and enhance our understanding of metric well-formedness: one may have non-isochronous subdivisions yoked to an isochronous beat, just as one may have non-isochronous beats yoked to an isochronous layer of subdivision.”",

                "text": "[7.5]\tGiven this observation, what is the mechanism by which a non-isochronous level can be “yoked” to a larger isochronous level? One hypothesis, suggested by Polak and London ( 2014 , [99]), is categorical perception : if non-isochronous rhythms implicate stable rhythmic categories, then perhaps they can be stabilized as meter by a larger isochronous level alone. (60) My projective annotations in Examples 24 and 25 formulate this hypothesis in terms of PMAP. (61) Like in Example 11, the non-isochronous level surfaces in conjunction with the larger isochronous level. However, rather than resolving the issue of non-isochrony within the scope of PMAP—as in the process represented by Example 11 and subsumed by the well-formedness/preference-rule loop in Example 23—the present hypothesis resolves the issue by referring to an external categorical-perception mechanism, as shown Example 23. Whether or not this new well-formedness/categorical-perception loop replaces or merely supplements the well-formedness/preference-rule loop is unclear. Either way, incorporating categorical perception helps tease apart universality and enculturation. In Lerdahl and Jackendoff’s ( 1983 , 99) model, the two overlap, since certain well-formedness rules are universal (MWFRs 1 and 2), while others involve acquired knowledge (MWFRs 3 and 4). In the present model, the two are cleanly separated: projection and well-formedness rules (MWFR 2) are universal, while preference rules and rhythmic categories are subject to enculturation.

                "text": "[7.6]\tCategorical perception also solves a problem with Mirka’s model that has not yet been addressed. Namely, in Example 26 , a simple series of alternating halves and quarters will never surface a unit quarter-note pulse under the three-attack threshold. While this might not be a problem for historical approaches to unequal triple meter, it is a problem for Mirka’s modern approach to triple meter. Yet surely with just a few repetitions of the pattern, we deduce the unit pulse from the relationship between the long and short values. Because 2:1 is a stable rhythmic category, the present hypothesis proposes that we might deduce a quarter-note pulse once the larger pattern stabilizes a dotted-half-note pulse. This seems especially likely with a 2:1 relationship since the ostensible unit pulse is represented within the pattern itself. The similarity between Example 26 and Example 11 is striking—it suggests that a 2:1 pattern in 4 3 meter might be processed as metric in a similar way that certain rhythmic patterns in non-isochronous meters are processed as metric. Indeed, Grant ( 2014 , 63) makes exactly this point when he observes that unequal triple meter is “similar in nature to the unbalanced meters in five or seven with which we are familiar in the twenty-first century.” Might there be a case for non-isochronous triple meter in modern theories of meter, along the lines of the bracketed level in Example 26? I leave that for future consideration.",

                "text": "[7.7]\tIf categorical perception, in tandem with PMAP’s projection mechanism, accounts for the non-isochronous meters in Examples 24 and 25, then we might ask whether the same mechanism extends to 20th- and 21st-century non-isochronous rhythms that lack an isochronous unit pulse. The removal of the eighth-note level from Example 10 is one such example and is shown in Example 27 . If 3:2 is a stable rhythmic category, then a non-isochronous level might form through a similar process as that represented by Example 26. But do we also perceptually deduce the eighth-note unit, which is no longer part of the non-isochronous level as it was in Example 26? And what about the 25:16 pattern, which features an even more complex rhythmic relationship? While 25:16 resembles the complexity of stable rhythmic categories in African drumming, it seems doubtful that Western musicians and listeners, even afficionados of rhythmically complex 20th- and 21st-century music, will have experienced the degree of enculturation needed to stabilize such a rhythmic category. Thus, the pattern is likely normalized. But to what is it normalized? And if normalized, to what extent do we still perceive the rhythms as deviating qualitatively from their normalized paradigms? At this point, I can only propose that answers to these questions likely vary from listener to listener and that there is likely a limit to how fine-grained rhythmic categories can get. Whatever the answers, these examples probe the limits of rhythmic categorical perception and, as I am hypothesizing, the limits of a PMAP-based theory of non-isochronous meter.",

The passage is an extreme refraction of the one in Example 29 , which is drawn from the piece’s exposition and is widely noted for its sudden calm amidst an otherwise tonally and rhythmically turbulent exposition. (62) The string parts in both passages, though complex in their rhythmic relationships with one another and with the piano, are internally regular and surface projective pulses along the lines suggested by my second extension to PMAP—that which incorporates multiple meters. The rhythmic relationships within the piano parts of Example 28 and 29 correspond to those of Example 27 (25:16) and 26 (2:1), respectively, and they pose the same issues within a larger multiple-meter context. I leave a full reconciliation of these issues with PMAP and categorical perception for another time.",
