    "abstract": "A central figure at the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in the 1950s, Bruno Maderna (1920–73) pioneered a type of serialism that was as deeply rooted in the contrapuntal tradition of the past, as it was committed to the exploration of new avenues in musical expression. This article investigates the serial arrays that lie at the core of his works written between 1951 and 1956. The constructive principles behind Maderna’s tone rows are explained, as are the ways in which he subjected them to order permutations that he represented graphically in matrices, tabulating order positions and pitch-class space. The article further examines how Maderna’s matrices served as the source for his rhythmic language. With evidence from the sketch materials and other sources, the analyses show how Maderna designed his serial arrays in response to what he considered to have been the shortcomings of the twelve-tone technique.",

Maderna and his friends summarily called the matrix, the other types of tables discussed below, and the permutation procedures performed in these arrays “quadrato/quadrati” ( Rizzardi 2004 , 33). My choice of the term “matrix” follows Borio 2004 , 109. Fein 2001 and Rizzardi 2004 use “square” (“Punktquadrat” and “quadrato” respectively). In her recent study of similar notations and procedures in Luigi Nono’s Il canto sospeso (1955–56), Jeannie Guerrero refers to the configuration as “Position-Grid” ( Guerrero 2006 , paragraph 24).",

Selected serial charts for Improvvisazione N. 1 (including my Examples 2a, 2e, 5, and the first four matrices of Example 4) have been discussed before by Fein ( 2001 , 15–27) and Rizzardi ( 2004 , 31–46). Improvvisazione N. 1 was likely the second work in which Maderna used the kinds of serial matrices to be discussed. He probably employed them for the first time in Studi per il “Llanto” di G. Lorca, an unfinished composition for tenor, flute, and guitar, that cannot be dated with certainty. Fearn 1990 , 345, and Karlen and Romito 1990 , 22, date Studi “1950–1952?”",

Maderna’s choice is interesting in light of the fact that other hexachord set classes could have been used as well for the generation of series built from the same kinds of intervals. Maderna’s choice of 6-20 ( Ode to Napoleon hexachord) and 6-1 (chromatic hexachord) was probably motivated by his study of the music of the Second Viennese School.

Closely affiliated with the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music since 1949, Maderna held the modernist view that music follows a continuous historical development and hence there could be no return to older musical styles. “Music is a continuous movement like human life,” he explained in a lecture he wrote in 1953–54, rejecting neo-classicism, neo-romanticism, and other “neo” aesthetics as being too limited in their narrow, naïve views of earlier music, and as lacking involvement with the present. (1) “But these images [of earlier musical periods],” he continued, “are precisely only images and not a general reconsideration of music as human expression.” (2) Instead, Maderna called for the exploration of new compositional techniques and expressive means in a progressive musical language that assimilated elements of the old in the new.",

(3) He found serial techniques to serve him best in this regard: a chosen material—a pitch-class series, a series of durations, etc.—could be transformed by way of serial permutations, usually to the extent that the original version of the material was no longer recognizable. To this end Maderna developed a rich palette of compositional strategies, quickly moving beyond the basic twelve-tone operations employed by the composers of the Second Viennese School and their followers. In addition, he gradually extended serial principles to a number of musical dimensions (such as rhythm, pitch register, and orchestration), and developed his own version of integral serialism.",

The entries below each heading identify serial devices employed in each of the three works discussed in this article. The shaded fields highlight materials that will be analyzed in the examples to follow. As we shall see, Maderna generally constructed his serial materials in the order listed from left to right, without using every serial device in every work. At the bottom of the example I have marked the distinct stages of the compositional process, which generally unfolded as follows: Stage 1) Maderna first designed one or several pitch series, twelve-tone or otherwise. (6) Some series were constructed from the two sizes of a (non-perfect) diatonic interval (e.g., series built from a succession of major and minor seconds). Stage 2) The order of the pitch classes in the series was then permuted, represented graphically in a succession of matrices, as discussed shortly. The permutations were guided by numeric values taken from a number table, often a magic or Latin square. Stage 3) Rhythmic values were assigned to the pitch-class materials following serial principles. Those principles may or may not have been related to the serial permutations in the pitch-class domain. Stage 4) Starting in 1953–54, Maderna often fed the pitch-class and rhythmic materials through filters, canceling some of these materials. Stages 5) and 6) During the final scoring process Maderna frequently \n\tdetermined pitch register and orchestration via serial principles as well.

Although mathematicians make no strict distinction between “array” and “matrix,” we shall presently reserve the latter term for a specific notation that tabulates pitch-class successions in a time-point grid, in distinction to other kinds of arrays.

The twelve columns project a succession of time points, read chronologically from left to right. Maderna represents a twelve-tone series or any other type of (ordered or partially ordered) set by placing dots in the corresponding positions of the matrix. The succession of dots connected with straight lines in the example, read from left to right, defines the twelve-tone series used in Improvvisazione N. 1 (B –A–D–F –C –C–F–E–B–E –A –G), to be discussed below. Maderna’s matrices are not always squares; they could use fewer than twelve pitch classes, and a larger or smaller number of time points.

The individual letters in the 12×12 grid can be assigned specific pitch classes, or they could be substituted by numbers to be interpreted as rhythmic values or to be used for serial permutations. Often, as here, such arrays form Latin squares: all rows and columns (and in the present case also both main diagonals) contain each of n letters (or numbers) exactly once. Maderna also uses magic squares, defined as grids of size n×n, whose cells hold values 1 to n 2 such that the rows, columns, and main diagonals add up to the same sum. In addition, he may also use rectangular arrays or other types of squares that are not magic or Latin squares. We shall now examine the construction of Maderna’s serial arrays and their compositional realizations for each of the three works in turn. Improvvisazione N. 1 (1951–52) Example 3 .

(11) The twelve pitches of the series are labeled A through N, with the first \ntrichord, central hexachord, and last trichord bracketed. (12) Below the series Maderna analyzes the succession of intervals, identified by their diatonic labels (“2-” = minor second, “5” = perfect fifth, “3+” = major third). The purpose of Maderna’s labels is to show that the intervals form a palindrome, illustrated by the brackets below. Since the intervals that appear in symmetrical order positions in the pitch series (i.e. the first and last interval, the second and penultimate interval, etc.) have the same size and direction, the series is retrograde-inversionally symmetrical. While the retrograde-inversional symmetry pertains to the series as a pitch - class series, that symmetry is also clearly visible (and audible) in the actual pitch representation of Maderna’s sketch. As we shall see again \n\t\t\t\t\t\tlater, Maderna always thinks of a series \n\t\t\t\t\t\tinitially as a succession of pitches, \n\t\t\t\t\t\trather than as a sequence of abstract pitch classes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is also evident from Maderna’s listing of all \n\t\t\t\t\t\tthe pitches in ascending order on the right of Example \n\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Since the series in its pitch representation is retrograde-inversionally \nsymmetrical, the registral distribution of the pitches is inversionally \nsymmetrical. This is shown by Maderna’s interval labels on the right margin: the pitch collection projects a major second (“2+”) at the bottom and top, and minor seconds in between. As demonstrated below, Maderna will later map the series onto other symmetrical registers as well, exploiting their properties in his orchestration. Example 4 .

The first of these is the one from Example 2a above, with an additional three dots that are not connected by straight lines (to which we shall return later). All dots represent pitch classes, rather than pitches. Since the series is its own retrograde-inversion under RI D D# and since D/D also lie midway in the vertical arrangement of the pitch classes in the matrix (6 = D, 7 = D ), the retrograde-inversional symmetry of the series produces an RI-symmetrical picture. (14) The lower case letters to the very left of the first matrix indicate the order of entry of the twelve pitch classes: “a” next to 2 means that 2 (B ) is the first pitch class of the series, “b” next to 1 means that 1 (A) is the second pitch class, etc.",

Thus the thirteenth dots in all rows taken together will reproduce the original series. This takes place twelve full matrices after the first statement of the series (after 144 positions = 12 matrices), that is, in the thirteenth matrix, which Maderna elides with the first.

The first descending minor second in Example 3 becomes an ascending major seventh in Example 8, and so forth. Since not only the pitch-class succession but also the contour of the original pitch series (Example 3) is RI-symmetrical, the derived version in Example 8 also projects an RI-symmetrical contour. This new version defines a new pitch collection that is itself again inversionally symmetrical, as illustrated by Maderna’s intervallic analysis on the right (“3-” = minor third, “4” = perfect fourth, etc.). This new pitch collection now serves as a template for the waltz phrase in Example 7; the pitch-class material obtained from matrix 11 (Example 6) is assigned to the registers of Example 8.

As a result, the partitioning of the series is symmetrical. As indicated by the added instrument labels (in square brackets), Maderna assigns the highest and lowest four pitches to the strings, with the addition of trombone in the lowest group, and the two dyads in the central register to the woodwinds (flute and oboe respectively).

Maderna’s musical language thus shares with the twelve-tone music of his predecessors the unifying element of a series while creating a musical surface that avoids repetition at all costs. In addition, Maderna’s serial array leads to a new concept of counterpoint and harmony. Harmony no longer results from a superposition of different contrapuntal layers (such as when several series unfold simultaneously) or from a verticalization of segments from a series. Rather, harmony arises directly from the serial permutations themselves: in Example 4, the permutation (horizontal shifting) of the dots (pitch classes) assigns them to specific columns in specific matrices. The permutation is an operation on the order positions occupied by each pitch class, with each being shifted following a unique pattern of displacement (no two pitch classes are shifted the same number of positions in the same order). A simultaneity arises when different pitch classes occur in the same column. The number of pitch classes per column fluctuates greatly. The matrices do not suggest a specific number of contrapuntal voices. Rather, the counterpoint we hear in Improvvisazione N. 1 is an interpretation of the matrices; by associating certain pitch classes with each other through register and orchestration—themselves based on serial permutation (contour inversion of the original pitch series)—Maderna creates a texture with clearly articulated, distinct instrumental voices.",

This series is now twelve-tone, marked “Buono.” The sketch also bears witness to the evocative character of Maderna’s serial construction. At the top of the sketch, he reflects upon the generative process: “NASCE LA SERIE – strani, flebili, dolce funerei richiami – nella notte” (the series is born—strange, faint, soft, mournful calls—at night). (26) In addition to series A-D Maderna derives a further twelve twelve-tone series from the same pool of intervals, at times including one tritone and a fourth and/or fifth. The corresponding sketches (not shown here) are titled “LA SERIE SI SVILUPPA” and “SERIE SVILUPP. al rovescio” (the series develops / series developing in reverse). The original nine-note row at the top of Example 9 thus serves as the generator for sixteen twelve-tone series.

The beginning of the corresponding sketch is transcribed in Example 14 . On the top staff, Maderna copies out the content of matrices 16 (retrograde) and 15 (recto). Underneath, he distributes the pitch-class material among three instruments, two acoustic (flute and piano) and one electronic (“El.”). The electronic instrument used is the melochord, a keyboard instrument that offers a variety of timbres to be recorded on tape. (32) The pitches are distributed over a wide range. The temporal order follows the one given in the matrices; no rhythms are assigned as of yet.",

No sketches survive that document Maderna’s rhythmic and dynamic choices. The dynamics appear to have been freely chosen. The rhythmic values, on the other hand, follow a pattern in which each pitch class (with the exception of D) always occurs with the same note value. A total of five different values are used, each of which is a multiple of a quarter note, as shown in Example 16 . (33) The pitch material, as orchestrated in Example 14, is realized in Example 15 such that the flute always holds a pitch preceding a general pause until it is reached (the “general pauses” are the quarter rests in Example 14, resulting from empty columns in the matrices). The same holds for the melochord (“El.”) before the first two general pauses. (34) The onset of these pitches, and hence of those that precede them, is thus calculated backwards from the general pauses. Overall, Maderna takes the opportunity to turn what could be realized mostly as a single line (see first staff of Example 14) into a texture that projects single pitches as well as simultaneities in Example 15 (via the orchestration of Example 14). Following the second general pause in measure 5 of Example 15, the third “phrase” in measures 6 (with pickup) to 9 is realized as a single line of Klangfarbenmelodie , moving from one instrument to another. (35) In the final version of the work, contrary to the instrumentation indicated, the score of Example 15 is performed entirely on the melochord \nand recorded on tape. (36)",

In 1954 Maderna started to subject his serial arrays to a device often used in the studio: the filter. This tool allowed him to control the outcome of his serial processes more flexibly by readjusting the materials of his arrays. Maderna did this either on an ad hoc basis—freely shortening or removing materials—or more formally with the help of further serial procedures, as in the second part of Serenata N. 2, to which we shall now turn.
