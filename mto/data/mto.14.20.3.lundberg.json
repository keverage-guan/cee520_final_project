    "abstract": "This article examines the use of canonic, fugal, and imitative writing in progressive rock, with special emphasis on the interaction between received models of composition and the apparent trialing and struggles to utilize, appropriate, and reinterpret such models in a popular, commercial, and performance-mediated idiom. While the reception history of progressive rock has hitherto mainly focused on the concepts of “pretension” (the appropriation of elements from the Western classical tradition) and “contention” (the countercultural social critique of cultural, musical, and political establishments), the music considered here illustrates problems of contention not just against the establishment but also within the counterculture itself, through both emblematic qualities of learned writing (surface allusions to counterpoint) and functional applications of received and appropriated counterpoint traditions (structural use of counterpoint).",

Macan has stressed that it would indeed have been hypocritical of the British progressive rock bands of the early 70s to present a roots-based “oppositional” music and that the only possible honest opposition would have to be voiced from within the demographic and cultural context with which the musicians were familiar ( 2006 , 166).

Future, more specialized studies of the reception of contrapuntal devices in progressive rock may be able to distinguish between different types of accusations of pretension: Gentle Giant always had more of a cult following than more famous bands like Yes, Genesis and Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

The first aligns with the informal historiography proposed in music criticism and sociology throughout the 80s and 90s. According to this interpretation, the bands involved were middle-class social agents seeking acceptance from their elders on the grounds of authoritative cultural capital deriving from the appropriation of classical and traditional musical elements (or, in the case of working-class musicians, as striving for increased cultural capital and socio-economic ascent). (1) Such apparent aspirations for cultural accreditation have often been viewed as an anomaly in the so-called counterculture movement, which was otherwise characterized by critique (or outright rejection) of all expressions of reverence for the individual artist, historical conventions, and middle-class values, and a mistrust of powerful institutions and mores. (2) Sheinbaum has posited an “inversion of musical values” within the late 60s and early 70s counterculture, suggesting that its dominant musical aesthetic favored simple structures over more complicated ones, repetition over development, and stimulation of the body over stimulation of the mind ( 2002 , 24–27). When viewed in light of such interpretative paradigms, musical elements such as canon, imitation, and fugue are construed by many scholars as somehow inherently in conflict with the cultural context in which progressive rock appeared. This interpretative trope, for many years predominant, may be summed up by charges of “pretension” and “self-indulgence” against progressive rock.",

Writers who subscribe to this view describe progressive-rock groups as speaking from within the counterculture while nonetheless relying on aesthetic and stylistic elements and compositional strategies from the Western classical tradition, and offering at times severe social critique and challenges aimed at the cultural establishment, indeed at the very authorities and institutional cultures by which they were schooled musically and intellectually. Some writers have focused on what Keister and Smith ( 2008 , 435–36) call “the nasty side of progressive rock,” unearthing or rediscovering dissident political, social, and ethical topoi in the otherwise lofty and abstract lyrics and highly ambitious music of these bands. (3) Here the balance of power between high-brow and low-brow is shifted, by claiming—as Keister and Smith do—that it was in fact popular culture that bestowed cultural capital onto the waning tradition of Western classical music, rather than vice versa. (4) This historiographical strand is held together by “contention,” i.e. tension between the established bourgeois culture and the counterculture. Such an analytical stance interprets contrapuntal writing in progressive rock as a traditional tool handed down from predecessors for ready use, just like any other means of musical expression that can be taught and perfected.",

(5) I will furthermore argue that contrapuntal writing is used in some instances as a deep principle of structural organization, where the contrapuntal devices are at the heart of the song, but that it occasionally also figures as surface allusion with a number of different associative implications. As we will see, the tradition of contrapuntal writing could be simulated or hinted at even when there is little counterpoint proper in the musical structure. These hypotheses have crystallized from analysis of a large amount of progressive-rock repertoire from Europe and North America ca. 1968–1980.",

Keister and Smith have drawn attention to the fact that “progressive rock found its strongest following among—but was not limited to—the hippie counterculture during the late 1960s/ early 1970s that opposed both elite and mainstream popular culture” ( 2008 , 448). While contrapuntal writing, along with many other idiosyncrasies of progressive rock, steered clear of associations with mainstream commercial culture, it was certainly susceptible to the charge of elitism leveled against progressive rock with ever greater intensity from the middle of the 70s onwards. (6) No socio-musicological model seems to fit well in our case, even if some come closer than others. It is difficult to explain contrapuntal writing primarily as aspiring for cultural accreditation, in spite of its associations with erudite and technically complex music, since counterpoint was not part of the middle-class appreciation of symphonic and operatic music. In contrast, the use of elements typical of the nineteenth-century symphonic poem could more readily be fueled by such aspirations, as has been pointed out by several authors ( Spicer 2000 , 77–78; Holm-Hudson 2002 , 111–13). This also the case with some twentieth-century orchestral music and Anglican Church music ( Macan 1992 , 102–3).",

A critique of the aesthetic ideology of such modernist appropriations could possibly be made (see Keister and Smith 2008 , 437–38), but is the same true of traditional counterpoint? This incorporation of a highly institutional practice into popular music seems to signify a discernible urge to incorporate this historically significant aspect of Western music into a new era of musical amalgamation of low-brow and high-brow. It was a common notion in the counterculture at the time that Western art music and commercial popular art music were poised to evaporate as separate entities, and that the more ambitious post- Sgt. Pepper acts—such as the bands discussed here—were the new synthesis from which future mainstream music would proceed. (7) I ultimately argue that the use of contrapuntal devices is best understood as an appropriation of received compositional models that partly represented contention within the circle of progressive-rock listeners, i.e., a point of controversy within the counterculture movement itself (where listeners would not naturally expect, or favor, conservative musical features). The appropriation of models that had served many different earlier styles and idioms in Western music constituted an implicit claim that progressive rock was the new classical music, for which reason it also offered a challenge to bourgeois musical conceptions. The appropriation is, moreover, an aesthetic and technical contention against other composers and musicians of all earlier times, based on the inherent possibility of competition in fixed compositional models.

From the perspective of musical historiography, it is primarily important as a case of attempted prophesy for what is to come. In the interview, McCartney mentions “psychedelic freakout,” “far out,” and “weirdo” music, implying some sort of “Zukunftsmusik”: a new advanced stage, free of the conventional and received principles of compositional techniques and form. The key factor seems to be expression without the inhibition of rules. It is at the same time both a social and a cultural contention (see also Chander 2008 ). Camille Paglia has interpreted 60s music (which she seems to hold as the pinnacle in the history of rock) as a predominantly Dionysian paradigm, stressing the qualities of individualism, spontaneity, energy, passion, rebellion, and demonism ( Paglia 1992 , 18–20). McCartney’s comments and the interpretation of this culture as Dionysian point to Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Traffic, Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, and a number of other acts coming to the fore in 1966–68. His statement also reminds us in a remarkably clear way, however, that nobody in 1967 could have possibly imagined that popular music was soon to take an Apollonian turn towards meticulously planned, composed-out, and regulated music, often drawing explicitly on principles from institutional and historical traditions. Thus the progressive-rock movement, which rose to cultural prominence less than a year after McCartney’s remarks, seemingly contradicted everything he anticipated in the music of the future. In its more far-reaching guises, this Apollonian turn inspired bands to explore one of the aspects of Western musical traditions that had seldom before then been assimilated into popular music, and would seldom be thereafter: linear melodic counterpoint.",

This results in a mixing of styles and idioms that would be considered distinct by scholars, but probably not by most coeval listeners. Covach’s observation points to stylistic allusions as emblems that could be recognizable to a listener reasonably familiar with the most celebrated works in the Western classical tradition. While Covach’s assertion is certainly valid as regards fugue and fugal expositions, it is questionable whether canonic structures integrated (or even hidden) within a song structure could be understood in that way, since such compositional techniques are generally absent from the symphonic, orchestral, and chamber repertoire known to non-specialist listeners. In such cases, we must look for another model of addressing matters of intentionality behind compositional choices. Canonic Writing Example 1 . Jethro Tull, “Round” 00:11–00:39 Example 2 .

While the two motives have similar endings, they have complementary contours and rhythm (see Example 1 ). “Asforteri 25” also takes leave of the stylistic surface manifestations of the round (see Example 2 ). It is difficult to establish a distinction of intention or poiesis (the creative process of writing the music) between appropriations of Western canonic idioms on the one hand, and layered music without such intentions on the other. On the immanent level (what is there for one to hear), however, the Caravan song is quite removed from any historical contrapuntal idiom. The manner of presentation hints more at canons for children and amateurs than at canons that appear as structural elements in composed-out songs: in the former cases, entries start one at the time, and then either fade out or drop out, as they would in a canon where the parts are not made to halt on a fermata. This presentation without sectional form in both examples suggests an intended simplicity of sound resembling the popular English round or catch, a low-brow bourgeois entertainment from the 1600s onwards. (10) Both songs, however, have ostinato parts that are independent of the canonic parts (like the “pedes” in a round). In the Jethro Tull example the imitative writing is integrated into coeval “vernacular” styles of music drawn from blues and folk-rock, while in “Asforteri 25” the imitation is not stylistically “masked” in the same way.

A distinction could be made here between cases where canonic structures are rooted in deep harmonic and voice-leading structures of the song, and where they occur as superimpositions over structures apparently composed in relation to only one of the canonic parts. Such a distinction is illustrated by passages from Yes’s “And You and I” ( Example 3 ) and Gentle Giant’s “As Old as You’re Young” ( Example 4 ). The distinction can be made both in relation to how much the canonic parts affect the entire texture (and not only the main melodic parts) and in relation to the independence of the canonic parts (whether or not any of the canonic parts could be removed, and whether the remaining part(s) relate equally well to the non-canonic parts).

The phrase structure also signals this subordination: the second entry in the middle voice of Example 3 is interrupted and realigned with the first entry to make a cadence and the time interval between the entries is shortened. (11) This is an instance of imitation in sectional, phrase-bound structure, rather than a canon in a cyclical structure. “As Old as You’re Young” (Example 4) has a structure that is cyclically repeated, without realignment of the parts or cadences appended in order to break the canonic structure.",

The latter case thus may be said to be a surface element of imitation, used only at one point in the song and primarily, I would argue, emblematic in its presentation. (12) This interpretation is also a response to its compositional context: a sudden change in instrumentation (from guitar, bass, drums, and multiple voices with Leslie effect to voices and acoustic guitar accompaniment only) and in the role of the two canonic voices as the main rhythmic guides of the section lend the impression of an exposition, which is not at all the case in “As Old as You’re Young.” There, the canon is fundamentally central in the song, but it is utilized as a development strategy, since the first refrain of the song features only one of the parts (the top part in Example 4, in A Mixolydian rather than G Mixolydian ). The effect of this canon at the unison, with both parts sung and phrased in identical manner by Kerry Minnear’s voice, is in fact one of Melodieschichten (resultant voice leading in a Schenkerian sense) between one group of notes (G3–D4) and another (D4–G4). I experience it not as notated above, with two-measure phrases alternating between the canonic parts, but rather as a repetition of one-measure segments, with a lower voice added to the melody of the A-major chorus ( Example 5 ).

This is true both locally (the canon appears within a texture of free writing in the instrumental parts, with motivic fragments of the canonic parts in the one-measure bass ostinato) and on a larger scale, since the canonic melody is the chorus melody, which was previously presented as a single lead part. The same melody appears in contrapuntal fragments in the modulation that follows the canonic section (see the last four measures of Example 4), enhancing the impression of canon as development. (13) In “And You and I” this is not the case, since the canon is presented at the very first appearance of the melody in question and never returns again in the song. (14)",

Another way to understand a canonic section of a song as simultaneous or successive composition is via its relation to harmonic mobility and stasis. In Example 3, the first entry in the “And You and I” canon moves with the harmonic progressions in measures 1 and 4 of the example, and is static when the harmony is static. The second entry, albeit equally firmly integrated harmonically, moves when the harmony is static—in fact measure 2 seems interpolated mainly in order to accommodate melodic movement without clashes. Furthermore, the time intervals between the entries are inconsistent, which signals that the surface design arises from the wish to have imitative entries here, and that the compositional process seems to have been successive.

It is, however, far from always the case that the emblematic or associative use of canon and imitation appears as surface-level design, as in “And You and I.” A similar compositional procedure to that in “As Old as You’re Young” is also found in Gentle Giant’s “His Last Voyage” (see Example 6 ), but here the use is also emblematic, i.e., showcased and self-referential with one or more intended associations with learned counterpoint for the listener.",

On account of this procedure, the canon is perceived as integrated into the song structure, or at least as a coherent continuation of what has been heard up to that point. It is not an agent of formal demarcation, and lacks the emblematic properties of a fugal or canonic exposition (characterized by one entry after another ex nihilo in a new section, often with a new tempo and instrumentation). Nevertheless it is showcased in a way similar to that in “And You and I,” and some intentional emblematic associations seem likely (e.g., it signals overtly that something complex is done with previously presented melodic material). “His Last Voyage” has a strict two-part canon (the top two staves in Example 6) and an added quasi-imitative part (the lowest staff). This added part (just like the second entry in the Yes song) is a key to our tentative distinction between emblematic and non-emblematic use, for why should one otherwise add a part that does not pull its structural weight, so to speak?  One reason seems to be a desire for imitative textures; another could be that strict imitation is not possible.",

This is of course nothing unique to progressive rock, but a common practice in the contrapuntal tradition. But such a planned-out, development-oriented strategy is progressive in the literal sense of the word (also, one could argue, ideologically). The contrapuntal techniques exemplified in the two Gentle Giant songs (as well as other songs by a number of other bands) have, as far as I am aware, never been derided and criticized in a countercultural context, either from an aesthetic or ideological perspective. (15) This suggests not only a successful appropriation of compositional techniques from the Western tradition, but also one that was widely acceptable to aesthetic paradigms within the counterculture movement. The same cannot be said of the examples of fugal writing to which we shall turn shortly. It could therefore be argued that this type of canonic integration in songs appears to have been uncontroversial in its cultural context as a compositional device, in spite of its complexity and apparent anomalousness in rock music.

The number of instances exemplifying this practice is much greater than those of canon, fugue, and imitation in this repertoire, and falls outside the topics covered in this study. Quodlibet technique has different historical roots from the compositional strategies analyzed in this study; it was not, as is the case with canon, fugue, and imitation (with a few mid-60s exceptions), new to commercial popular music by 1968, and therefore it needs to be examined in a different context of culture and reception history. (16) Still, it requires compositional planning similar to that of canon and round, and therefore merits a brief discussion here. When it comes to small-scale instances of quodlibet (only one or a few measures long), there are some examples in which this is nearly indistinguishable from the compositional technique of the round (see e.g. Gentle Giant’s “Raconteur Troubadour” where the melodic material from two contrasting sections is combined). Quodlibet can, however, be utilized to allude to a learned contrapuntal style, as well as to provide a musical means of harmonic contrast, complementary figuration, and independently aligned phrasing. One such example is “L’orchestra dei fischetti” (1977) by the Milanese band Stormy Six (see Example 7 ). Different dense contrapuntal textures are derived throughout the song from a set of short diatonic melodies. This is a much more multifaceted and versatile use of the melodic material than in the Jethro Tull and Caravan examples, and very different  from the way in which Gentle Giant downplayed the contrapuntal structure in relation to the rest of the songs. Here, the contrapuntal cleverness is at the forefront.",

This is a relationship that few listeners would probably grasp upon first exposure to the song, hearing it instead as a straight rendition of the first melodic element with complex and irregular guitar arpeggiation. The last melodic element to enter sets the text “Niente resta uguale a se stesso, la contraddizione muove tutto” (Nothing remains equal to itself, the contradiction changes everything), which appears to be a direct lyrical reflection on the compositional technique—something not found in the other examples discussed so far.

The revolutionary topic of this verse, nothing out of the ordinary in the international “Rock in Opposition” movement of which Stormy Six was part, would have been clear to most contemporaneous listeners. The second verse (04:23–04:45) presents the second quodlibet melody, sung in parallel thirds and sixths to a rhythmically complex version of what sounds like a pastiche of rural Italian mandolin accompaniment. Then the third melody presents the lyric that here is taken as an analytical key to the entire song: that nothing stays the same, that oppositions and contradictions change everything, as if out of a Hegelian-Marxist handbook. I would venture further that this melody, even before its combination with the other two, may present a musical reflection of the text, in its surprising modal turn to the lowered 7th scale degree in the context of a major key at the word “contraddi zion e.” When the three melodies are combined a cappella , the effect of the polyphonic texture and the simultaneous sets of lyrics create a carefully planned climax.",

This is significant since Stormy Six shared concert bills (and thereby audiences) with the Swedish group Samla Mammas Manna, the French Etron Fou Leloublan and the Belgian Univers Zero in the late 70s.

The Rock in Opposition movement of the late 70s may certainly be seen as a rather different context from the late-60s counterculture in Britain, from which progressive rock as a genre initially emerged. “L’orchestra dei fischetti” may with some justification be held to lack all three of the elements that Macan has outlined as a socio-musicological characterization of progressive rock: the Romantic notion of musician as (solitary) prophet, the idealization of rural pre-modern society, and a notion of spirituality and transcendence in music ( 1997 , 68, 73–74; 2006 , xxxix, 108). Stump, on the other hand, has pinpointed (without discussing this track or any other by Stormy Six) what seems to be at work here, when he ventured that in the youth culture of (predominantly northern) Italy “audiences of young radicals saw this style [of conservatoire and operatic traditions] not only as a well-spring of forbidden secular jouissance but also as a means of taunting their elders and betters by appropriating establishment forms and using them as distorting mirrors. Much Italian Progressive wears its classical ancestry unashamedly” ( Stump 2010 , 123).

The album version was recorded in Croydon Hall with The Nice and the London Sinfonia. Emerson has credited Friedrich Gulda as the main source of inspiration of the fugue, and it indeed seems to draw on Gulda’s Prelude and Fugue in E-flat minor. (18) “High Level Fugue” is not a complete fugue, but a single exposition lasting around one minute. By 1969, Keith Emerson was really on his own when it came to such experiments with art-music forms in rock music, and his attempts seem to have been widely embraced within the “free,” “freaked-out,” and experimental ideal described in Paul McCartney’s 1967 interview, despite his assessment of traditional compositional rules as no longer relevant. The Nice was in this respect already making the music that was later to become progressive rock, but it seems to have been understood rather differently at the time. (19)",

Similarly to “High Level Fugue,” the “Endless Enigma” fugue seems to be based on a compositional model, in this case not anything from the fugal repertoire, but rather the two-part keyboard inventions by J.S. Bach, widely used as didactic models of piano playing. Macan has stressed the importance of Bach’s music for Emerson’s piano playing and writing ( 2006 , 3). In a general sense, Macan’s suggestion is relevant.  Stylistically, one could consider BWV 722, the C-major invention, where not only the type of two-part exposition, voice allocation, and episode writing are remarkably similar to the Emerson, Lake and Palmer example, but also the subject itself is similar.

According to such an interpretation, the quotation of the Enigma theme in the fugue accomplishes large-scale closure through the final statement of the same melody to the lyrics “Now that it’s done, I’ve begun to see the reason why I’m here” as a peroration. Macan’s analysis of “Fugue” resembles my analysis of “L’orchestra dei fischietti” above. Both interpret the climactic thematic statements as a peroration in the rhetorical structure: thematic entries that explain or reveal something of the piece as a whole by way of conclusion. But in “Endless Enigma” we lack a clear program for the song in which the fugue appears (in “L’orchestra dei fischietti” it is the very contrapuntal section that is the climax, music that resolves the tension among the three layers of lyrics). I agree with Macan’s interpretation of the thematic statement as an intentional allusion. I would even be willing to interpret the descending figure in measure 1 of Example 7 as a motivic reference to the melodic line that precedes the lyric “your words waste and decay . . . ,” but it is unclear  whether Macan suggests this.  The potential redeeming function of this allusion, however, is only one of several possible interpretations. Emerson often quotes himself and others in freer sections and solos, which normally do not give rise to meanings beyond that of a bit of clever wittiness. (21) This caveat does not detract much from Macan’s analysis of the piece, but it has its place, since there are some elements of Emerson’s soloist-like playfulness in this otherwise through-composed piece.

The character Meurglys III is Peter Hammill’s guitar, named after Ganelon’s sword Murgleis in the twelfth-century Le Chanson de Roland ou de Ronceveaux .

It is similarly absent from the sections where Hammill sings about it (or to it). It seems reasonable to interpret the guitarless sections as the background to the song Hammill is trying to compose, a multi-layered theatrical approach that is commonplace in progressive rock.

The term was by this time well-connected with the general trope of “pretension” and “pretentiousness” by which influential music critics had marked and condemned progressive rock (giving rise to the first of the two historiographical strands outlined above). By the mid 70s, the broader community of progressive rock showed several signs of self-awareness of this stigma. A few months after the release of “Meurglys III,” Gentle Giant labeled their compilation album “Pretentious—For the Sake of It” (1977). Philip Sutcliffe’s liner notes are illustrative of the apologesis for complexity and sincerity: “Gentle Giant, dedicated musicians that they are, have never taken themselves that seriously. They’ve always been one of the bands to cop flak from rock pundits who reckon Chuck Berry said it all, and so on an American tour they took the key put-down word of that school of criticism and spelt it out in huge neon letters above the stage while they played their set: ‘PRETENTIOUS’.”",

The difference between Gentle Giant’s and Sutcliffe’s statements on the one hand, and Hammill’s lyrics in “Meurglys III” on the other, seems to be that the latter is not an attempt to wittily defend or deny pretension, but rather a sincere take on what may be termed the problem of pretentiousness in popular music. “Meurglys III” poses the idea of simple, personal, and passionate music with the guitar as one’s only companion against the contrapuntal structures that open the song, the melodic material of which returns intermittently. The opening relates to the melodic theme that appears to represent self-absorption, solipsism, and music that nobody wants to hear. The riff consists of the notes E–D–G joined to a row of eight rapid notes from the canonic exposition (see the last eight notes in the top part of Example 11). When the vocals enter, the E–D–G figure is exchanged for the descending tetrachord E–D–C–B, still with the latched-on eight notes from the canonic exposition. (01:38–02:13) “These days I mainly just talk to plants and dogs— all human contact seems painful, risky, odd; I stay acting god in my own universe where I trade cigarettes in return for songs. The deal’s made harder the longer I go on: I find me gone from all but secret languages.”",

It is also melodically identical to the first part of the riff discussed above, but here augmented to constitute a bass line and harmonic foundation.

This type of conflict between sections and layers was not new to Van der Graaf Generator. A good example of similar competing layered sections within a song can be found in the 1971 track “Man-Erg,” where the two sections represent two sides of the narrator’s (Hammill’s, one presumes) personality. The struggle in “Meurglys III” is left unresolved both musically and lyrically, followed by the words: “Though I know all this is just escape, I run because I don‘t know where the prison lies.

Over this pattern, the character of Meurglys III (the guitar) speaks, with a solo based on the thematic material from the opening fugato.

                "text": "[40] The reader may find this interpretation far-fetched, but I will present additional arguments in its favor below. Significantly, by 1977, few progressive-rock bands were writing LP-side long tracks (“Meurglys III” clocks in at 20:55), and Van der Graaf Generator had not done so since “A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers” in 1971 (a very long period in the career of any band at the time). (24) This opens up a hermeneutic window for an interpretation of retrospectivity, which is also directly addressed in the lyrics. Furthermore, the song is about Hammill’s guitar. Hammill could by no means be seen as a guitarist on the same level as, for example, Steve Howe of Yes, Steve Hackett of Genesis, or Robert Fripp of King Crimson. In live sets he was primarily a singer, occasionally doubling on second keyboard. The band was in essence always a drums-organ-saxes-vocals outfit. Significantly, on the early Van der Graaf Generator tracks, Robert Fripp of King Crimson was called on to provide guitar parts. It was the lack of guitar and bass sonorities that provided the unique sound of early Van der Graaf Generator. Even when the two instruments are used, they are not played by specialized instrumentalists like the bass players and guitarists of most other British progressive acts. This fact is possibly significant in analyzing this song, since it purports to treat an instrument which was not central to the group’s writing in the early progressive period of the first years of the 70s.",

Is it intended as the strange music (“secret languages”), as opposed to the vocal sections in “familiar style”? Considering the representational and symbolic density of Peter Hamill’s lyrics from the preceding albums ( Godbluff , 1975 and Still Life , 1976) either of these interpretations seems a conceivable explanation for the sole use of strict contrapuntal writing in the entire output of Van der Graaf Generator. In the light of the factors elucidated above, one might even venture to suggest that “Meurglys III” could be heard and read as a comment on the death of progressive rock, or alternatively as a comment on its transition from a vital cultural idiom of some social significance to solipsism and introversion.

As in Emerson’s case, this lack of compositional training seems to result in contrapuntal exercises that are conceived at the keyboard, and that remain keyboard-centered even when parts are allocated to other instrumentalists. This is fundamentally different from the contrapuntal writing for ensemble forces by Kerry Minnear of Gentle Giant (a composition major from Royal Academy of Music) and also from that of the Royal College of Music alumni and Early Music instrumentalists Brian Gulland and Richard Harvey in Gryphon. The fugato writing in Gryphon’s “Opening Move” (03:53–04:29) from the 1974 album Red Queen to Gryphon Tree never amounts to fugue, but it is shaped formally by a similar balance of tonally separated entries, with the effect of having been written for an ensemble rather than having been conceived at the keyboard (see Example 12 ). The contrapuntal section is firmly rooted in the song as a whole: the fugato subject is derived from a short motive used for demarcation in the preceding section (03:39–03:52), spun out in an extended bassoon-led section (04:33–07:25), and then recurs as a demarcating motive (08:27–08:45). The large-scale sectional form and motivic cohesion resemble Gentle Giant’s use of canon in “As Old as You’re Young” and “His Last Voyage,” but “Opening Move” has stronger stylistic contrasts among its sections than do those songs. This is effected by way of instrumentation and timbre (the recorder, bassoon, acoustic guitar, and analogue synthesizer are prominent in the mix, without reverberation), tempo (just as in Emerson’s “Endless Enigma” fugue, the exposition picks up at a fast pace, independent from earlier tempi, immediately after a freer section—a possible reference to prelude or fantasia style), and by figuration with Fortspinnung and suspensions emblematic of the school fugue as taught in the above-mentioned fugue primers.

                "text": "[43] A case similar to that of Gryphon’s “Opening Move” is “Carnival Fugue” by the Dutch band Focus. Like “Fugue” from “Endless Enigma,” the fugal writing is preceded by a semi-improvisational piano-led introduction consisting of four varied reiterations of a theme that does not recur in the contrapuntal section. The 2 + 2 repetitions in the introduction are interpolated with a cul-de-sac modulation leading to a tonal area that is immediately abandoned, and which when first heard seems to invoke both rhythmically and melodically the theme of the second movement of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony (and with the same sequential repetition), but which in fact is related to the fugal theme: it consists of the eight-note groups followed by a quarter note at the same sequential distance (see Example 13 ). The subject of “Carnival Fugue” seems to have been conceived with more planning in relation to possible contrapuntal treatment than the subjects in either exposition by Emerson, Lake and Palmer or Van der Graaf Generator. It is invertible at the minor third below or major sixth above, which facilitates entries at degrees other than those of the tonic and dominant, and it appears in stretto and quasi-stretto entries. The exposition is in C minor, but the highly chromatic subject does not clearly define a key. The second entry is in Ab minor, which illustrates the irregularity of the tonal plan of the piece. The subject appears in double counterpoint with several entries in A minor, and entries at the inversion with stretto. This type of compositional control sets “Carnival Fugue” apart from any other examples discussed above (even Gryphon’s “Opening Move”) and most likely testifies to Thijs van Leer’s studies in composition at the Amsterdam conservatoire.

It showcases the surface features of the technique, with a lengthy, rhythmically and intervallically poignant subject that enters at different transposition levels in different instruments, but in a context of otherwise free material.

Gentle Giant, for example, frequently utilizes hocket, where a monodic structure is fragmented and alternated between two or more parts with intermittent breaks and pauses within a single part (see, for example, “Knots” and the opening sections of “His Last Voyage”). Kerry Minnear’s clavinet playing is distinguished by such rhythmic micro-syncopation and fragmentation, and the fact that in live performances he often transforms originally homophonic passages into hocket textures corroborates our definition of it as essentially a surface-level textural elaboration of monodic writing.

This is the six-part “Moog Fugue” by Kerry Minnear of Gentle Giant, which was originally sketched and composed in the early 1980s and later reworked with added instrumental tracks by a partly reunited line-up of Gentle Giant in the late 1990s.

Its timbre and instrumentation give the impression of AB form, but thematically it is tripartite. The entire exposition is performed by keyboard instruments alone (John Weathers enters with drum kit at the fourth entry). The first five entries each use different Moog sounds, while the sixth introduces piano, the first acoustic instrument apart from the drums. It is only at the beginning of the episode that the entire band enters, but now Gary Green’s guitar, overdubbed with several motivic replies and countermelodies in the lengthy modulation, asserts supremacy. The second exposition is, in contrast to the first, entirely combo-based, with acoustic piano and guitar sharing most entries (the Moog doubles some entries, but it is deep down in the mix). This succession of instrumentations pays lip service to conventions in rock and jazz that would have been germane to most listeners in the counterculture: a keyboard intro, followed by a guitar solo, rounded off by a section of the full band. This organization highlights the reconciliation of polyphonic processes with the expected large-scale sectional form, just as in other complex structures in Gentle Giant’s music (see Lundberg 2014 ). Compared with the Stormy Six example, in which contrapuntal idioms seem to have been ideologically and aesthetically unproblematic (or even desirable), here we see the form of the fugue positively downplayed to notions of the “familiar style.”",

Rather, they seem to be related to the tradition of the essai , or imitatio auctorum , in which one practices a style by taking a pre-existent model as a point of departure. Robert Hatten’s ( 1985 ) distinction between competency of style (understanding, interpretation, and identification of organizational patterns) and competency of strategy (the ability to compose particular manifestations within a style) is relevant here. Minnear certainly knew very well how a fugue functions stylistically and how it ought to be constructed, but since it was not likely to have been one of his most natural idioms of composition, his competency of strategy may have left him with a subject somewhat resembling a that of a pre-existent work.

Bach’s “Little” G-minor fugue, BWV 578. Examples 15 and 16 provide the beginning of the “Moog Fugue” and Bach’s fugue for comparision. Thematically, “Moog Fugue” adheres closely to BWV 578, the two main differences being that its subject has a descending line in natural minor, 8 ˆ – 7 ˆ – 6 ˆ – 5 ˆ with lowered seventh and sixth degrees, and a second half that modulates sequentially flatwards (Example 15). Bach’s subject, in contrast, uses the leading tone and has no modulatory section within itself. Passages of flatwards Fortspinnung do, however, occur in Bach’s model, as we can see in the last three measures of Example 16, which prepares for the second subject entry by moving back toward the tonic from the minor dominant of the answer. It is possible that Kerry Minnear derived the second part of his subject from such passages in Bach’s fugue. The fourth-species suspensions of falling fifths that provide Minnear’s countersubject recall the textbook fugue style that he would certainly have been taught at the Royal Academy of Music. Non-thematic passages are linked to the entries of the subject by way of motivic fragments, such as in the answer in measures 14–16 in Example 11 and in the bass part in the episode (see Example 14 above).

It lacks the alienating function of shock typical of the avant-garde. It also lacks, however, the potential aesthetic contention of shock by rhythmic intensity, dissonance, and strong dynamic contrast otherwise found in progressive rock. Furthermore, it lacks the flamboyant virtuosity and splendor in either harmonic relationships or timbre, which is at the heart of progressive-rock style, and which has often been read as pretension. Instead, contrapuntal writing may be seen as an academic approach, in the eyes of rock listeners and critics the most far-reaching detachment from “all that is gutter pure in rock,” as Lester Bangs wrote in 1974.
