Since history does not exist, there are only ‘histories of . . . ’ and histories of which the eventlike atom is the plot.  The value of a history book will depend first of all on the cutting out of that plot, the unity of action it requires, the boldness with which this unity has been extricated from more traditional cutouts—in \nshort, on its originality . . .",

I wondered if it might not be equally legitimate, given his probable exposure to fencing in Lüneburg, to look for thrusts and parries in Bach’s music. David Yearsley doesn’t quite get to fencing, but his Bach and the Meanings of Counterpoint invokes a wide range of other cultural manifestations drawn from three centuries.",

(1) His reasons for this characterization include the subjectivity of the choice of subject matter, the lack of method, the originality of the \n“plot,” and the arrangement of the documentary evidence. (2) The choice of what to present and how is central: “The scholar does not tell \nstories or comment on the past, he shows it; in fact, chooses and organizes it, \nand his work has the false impersonality of a documentary photomontage. \nErudition is a variety of historiography to which we give too little thought; \ntwo centuries of historicist speculation have excessively associated ‘history’ \nwith ‘science’ or ‘philosophy,’ whereas the natural place of history, the \ndocumentary knowledge of the concrete, is situated at the opposite pole, that of \nerudition . . . history or poetry . . . is perceived through documents or texts \nthat have density and the handling of which is, besides, a source of pleasure or \nof interest; it may even be considered that it is the taste for handling this \ndense matter that is the surest sign of an authentic sense of what history or \npoetry really is.” (3)",

He is at his best when laying out the material, placing things side by side, presenting long quotations, musical examples, and pictures. However, he sometimes overreaches in his desire to draw conclusions, and his search for \n“meanings” leads him far from Veyne’s ideal. Veyne says that a “document has a double nature. On the one hand, it belongs by its form to a series: a legal document, to the series of legal documents; a building, to that of buildings [etc.] . . . on the other hand, like every event, it is at the crossroads of an indefinite number of events and is capable of answering an indefinite number of questions. Erudition is only concerned with the first aspect: it establishes the meaning of a document in its series according to the rest of the series; it leaves to the user the task of asking all the questions he wants. Its task consists in showing him only what questions he must not ask; one does not question a false act like an authentic one, nor a proverb like a truth established after inquiry; thus erudition is content to adjust the optics of the documents. After that, each person can look in the document and there perceive the past with all the richness of vision of which he is personally capable.” (4)",

The most striking instance of overinterpretation comes as a consequence of equating the discipline of contrapuntal technique with concentrated political power (Chapter 4). In a clever zeugma, Yearsley says of Frederick the Great and Bach that \n“Both men were intent on dominating their subjects.” (170) Speaking of the Canon a 4 from A Musical Offering, he says: “A majority of the contrapuntally additive voices announce the entry of the theme as well as their own submission to it” (162), and \n“Here was a thoroughly ‘well-regulated’ music akin to absolutist ruthlessness.” (170) This metaphor sounds a little shrill, but that’s nothing compared to the trouble it gets the author into later, when he is discussing Frederick the Great as the \n“proto-Führer” (note 43, page 231) in German musicology of the thirties.",

We have an example ready at hand from the recent memoir Jarhead, in which Anthony Swofford recounts how soldiers in the First Gulf War were psyched to go into battle by watching scenes from Apocalypse Now, a film about the Vietnam War with an originally anti-war agenda. (5) Now that the military has co-opted the famous helicopter attack scene (accompanied by the \n“Ride of the Valkyries”), should pacifists not watch it? The Nazis wanted to take Bach on board because he was already a giant figure, not just because it is possible, by an imaginative use of metaphor, to find some reflection of military discipline in it. Yearsley must either actually believe there is fascism in the music or that his having written about it makes him complicit, neither of which is true. He has succeeded in making an imaginative juxtaposition of historical documents, and has convincingly shown how people in the past might have come to the conclusions they did. But he is not responsible for those conclusions, and he should leave us to \n“perceive the past with all the richness of vision” we are capable of. If we want to, then, I suppose we can let the association with evil from hundreds of years later poison our hearing of Bach, but that decision should be left up to us.",

Veyne has little patience with such historical \n“explanation:” “It is known what a stir was made by Panofsky’s book in which he sets forth the discovery he thinks he has made of a formal homology between the great theological summas of the thirteenth century and the structure of Gothic cathedrals. I do not know if that homology exists, and is not one of the many phantoms raised by the combinative. But let us suppose it does exist; the real, the only question will then be to explain concretely how that homology between the book of a theologian and the work of an architect could have been produced. Panofsky certainly does not fail to try to explain it—could it be that architects and theologians associated with each other, and that a foreman wanted to transpose into his own art the subdivision procedures of the Scholastics, as Seurat and Signac wanted to apply to painting the physical theory of primary colors (which they had misunderstood, so much so that in their pictures those colors do not recombine and produce a grisaille)? Many other explanations are imaginable, but, as long as we do not have the right one, Panofsky’s thesis will be an unfinished page, and not at all an example to be followed by the human sciences.” (6)",

He says that \n“in a fugue all voices compete with each other and none has preference over another as is the case with other genres.” (7) These \n“other genres” (ones characterized by melody and accompaniment texture, like aria or sonata) might provide more persuasive metaphors for authoritarian behavior.",

The latter is exemplified by galant style, by Mattheson’s ideal of \n“free-flowing, natural melody” (54), and the former by various kinds of learned canon, \n“obscure mysticism and secret practices.” (91) Yearsley finds both juxtaposed in the duetto in F from Clavierubung III: \n“As against the loose and engaging style of the opening, we have less dialogue than clinical examination of contrapuntal material: erudite recitation supplants the logical succession of rhetorically persuasive ideas.” (108) I agree that there’s a sharp contrast between the A section and the B section, but not that one is more contrapuntal than the other.",

After all, it is the same Mattheson who says that the reason we use invertible counterpoint is that \n“[A]n assiduous organist no less than an ingenious composer or Capellmeister can draw materials and inventions from these artifices for the rest of his life.” (8) For him, the purpose of strict learned techniques is to aid in the making of inventions. Counterpoint, then, is a technique, and flowing melody is a style.

He wants to bring counterpoint down to earth: \n“The great mystery turns out to be nothing more than a gimmick.” (44). He demonstrates often how counterpoint is a locus of fun and even humor: the crab canon on the Royal Theme is \n“an invitation to recreation and amusement.” (155). To show us that “such pieces . . . are not as difficult as they appear,” he composes his own crab canon on the same theme, allowing as how Bach’s is \n“not only a better piece than mine, it’s funnier too” because “it goes nowhere faster.” (153–155) It is reassuring to see a musicologist playing in the sandbox with the great composers of the past, closing up the gulf between style and technique. Yearsley’s only reference to present-day counterpoint pedagogy is a reference to Kent Kennan’s counterpoint text, in which Kennan takes a trial-and-error approach to crab canon. (9) Yearsley disapproves, finding Marpurg’s method, which he used to compose his own, clearer and easier. And that is not his only complaint with present-day attitudes: \n“Current engraving software is unable to produce reversed clefs and key signatures, a fact that nicely demonstrates the current obscurity of the genre of the crab canon and its semiotics.” (note to Example 4.9, page 151)",
