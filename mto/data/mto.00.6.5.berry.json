Finding sources that elucidate aspects of their personal or professional lives, or concentrate on their business successes\nand the commercial attainments of their songs, is not difficult.

(2) He has also been the subject of numerous erudite studies by the musicologist Charles Hamm, including a monograph devoted to his early years as a songwriter. (3) Published analyses of his songs, however, have\nbeen much less common—a rather regrettable state of affairs for a person Cole Porter declared to be “the greatest song-writer of\nall time.” (4) Alec Wilder, himself a songwriter and composer,\nprovided cogent verbal commentary on numerous Berlin songs in a chapter of his 1972\nbook; (5) Allen Forte engaged in much more\nintricate analyses of a half-dozen songs in his 1995 volume on the repertory; (6) and I have focused on certain associations\nbetween the large-scale melodic line and the lyrics, in select songs, in a journal\narticle. (7) Otherwise, not much has been done. Thus, the\nappearance of a book that promises to provide “new information on how [Berlin’s] songs were created,” and to “delineat[e] a ‘life\nin song’,” causes the interested musician to take notice.

                "text": "[0.3] Such a book appeared in late 1998, written by Philip Furia, a Professor of English who had previously established a\nspecialization in the  repertory’s lyrics though two books, The Poets of Tin Pan Alley: A History of America’s Great\nLyricists (which, naturally, included a chapter on Berlin), and Ira Gershwin: The Art of the\nLyricist . (9) The book under review, Irving Berlin: A Life in Song , is in part a standard chronological narrative of the songwriter’s life. The main text\nis divided into twelve chapters, each of which draws its title from that of a Berlin song (or, in one case, a\nphrase from a song)—a somewhat hackneyed device that did not seem particularly ingenious when Freedland employed it (using some of the same\ntitles) a quarter-century earlier. The purely biographical information is enhanced, however, by Furia’s work at the Irving\nBerlin Archive at the Library of Congress, from which he derived some materials not included in other biographies; and also from\npresumed suggestions by Berlin’s daughters, Mary Ellen Barrett and Linda Emmet, who are credited with giving “the manuscript a\nvery careful and helpful reading” (page ix). Also incorporated into each chapter are Furia’s examinations of select songs. Some of\nthese are quite brief, and even the longer interpretations probe the lyrics much more than the\nnotes (as would be expected from a writer of Furia’s background). Still, his insights about lyrics\nare often revelatory; they elucidate features of specific songs, as well as general mannerisms, that might pass without comment in\nmore “music-theoretical” investigations. Moreover, as advertised, he does provide contextual details about the creation and\nevolution of many songs, and these certainly reinforce the theme that Berlin’s was “a life [spent] in\nsong.”",

Rhynland , which brought his family to New York; to his increasing triumphs as a\nwriter of popular hits and stage and film songs; to the waning years of his career, which witnessed some\nsuccesses (e.g., Call Me Madam and the 1966 revival of Annie Get Your\nGun ) but several failures (e.g., Miss Liberty and Mr. President );\nand then to his virtual reclusion and death at age 101. Coming after so many other biographies, the general timeline as well as many of the\ndetails presented by Furia will be very familiar to the Berlin aficionado. Nonetheless, in addition to the author’s pleasing\nwriting style, there are two attributes that cause the current book to stand apart. First, regarding various facets of Berlin’s\ncareer, Furia provides additional context that has been ignored, or treated less completely, in some prior biographies. Second, he\nis able to impart some new information though his research at the Berlin Archive.",

                "text": "[1.2] As for the enriched historical context Furia provides, perhaps it is most evident when he turns to Berlin’s work as a\nsongwriter in the emerging world of sound movies, beginning in the late 1920s (chapter 7). He delivers more than just requisite\nfacts about the birth of the industry, he also explains differences between the uses of songs in films and in musicals\nand operas; how film studios came to commandeer many Tin Pan Alley publishing firms, once they realized the extra profits and\npublicity music could provide; and particular ways in which studios would place invested\ncommercial objectives over artistic ones, where music was concerned (as when they would adapt\nsuccessful Broadway shows, only to discard the songs that made them popular, and insert new ones for which they owned the\nrights). Also addressed is the public’s early disenchantment with film musicals—in the days after their enthusiastic introduction\nbut before their impending golden era—and how it impacted projects with which Berlin and\nother songwriters were involved. Later in his narrative (in chapter 9), Furia returns to the\nsubject, once the rebirth of the film musical is underway, and explains the emergence of Top Hat (1935), the Art Deco classic with Berlin’s songs and Astaire’s and Rogers’ dancing, as well as Alexander’s Ragtime Band (1938), the “first film ever to carry a songwriter’s name above the title and ahead if any other name\nin the credits” (page 186). Many Berlin biographers have addressed the machinations of Hollywood, but few have done it in as\nilluminating a fashion as Furia.",

Furia\ndiscusses its emergence in the Princess Theatre shows of Jerome Kern, Guy Bolton, and P. G. Wodehouse; and it is against this\nbackdrop that we come to understand the implications of Berlin’s decision to continue with less dramatically “integrated” revues,\nof a type more familiar to him. The topic resurfaces frequently, as with the consideration of Berlin’s As Thousands Cheer (1933), which infused the review format with an innovative\ncohesion by relating its sketches to the various sections of a newspaper—having headlines and photographs “come to life,” as it\nwere. The book’s penultimate chapter rounds off the topic with a focus on Annie Get Your\nGun (1946), a musical which allowed songs to grow out of character development and dramatic exigency,\nbut which still managed to “produc[e] more hit songs than any Broadway show before or since,” with “virtually every song\n[becoming] an independent success” (page 229).",

                "text": "[1.3] As for Furia’s archive research, the results are generally woven invisibly into the text, although two applications stand\nout: his use of many informative quotations “taken from newspaper clippings in Irving Berlin’s scrapbooks” (page 285), including from\n“undated and unidentified” articles of sufficient obscurity to have escaped the attention of prior biographers; and his\nconsultation of lyrics manuscripts, which enable him to trace the evolution of certain songs. I will return to the latter topic\nwhen lyrics analysis is addressed. Regarding his presentation of information from archive\n“clippings,” my only criticism is that sometimes Furia is too willing to allow quotations from these\nsources to stand on their own, when clarification or at least informed interpretation seems to be in order. A prime example\narises when “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” (1911) is addressed. For years it was reported in Berlin biographies that the song\noriginated as a piano march—an instrumental composition sans lyrics. However, more recently, Charles\nHamm argued that the song version actually came first, and only later was adapted into an\ninstrumental two-step. Supporting evidence includes not only the facts of the copyright dates (the instrumental version was\ncopyrighted a half-year after the song), but also the structure of the piano version,\nwhich is peculiar when compared to most marches and rags, and suggests an adaptation of an earlier\nsong. (10) Furia, in his discussion, asserts the\nolder view (that a piano version was written first), with no suggestion in the main text that such an opinion has been challenged. In the\nendnotes, he acknowledges Hamm’s conclusion (a product of “formidable” scholarship, he admits), but Furia counters that he\nhas found “several interviews where Berlin himself states that [the song] was first an instrumental” (page 288). These quotations\nare assimilated into the main text, and give rhetorical weight to Furia’s claims about the sequence of composition. However, by\nnever addressing the inconsistencies between Hamm’s research and Berlin’s own remarks—by never even acknowledging such a\ndiscrepancy exists, except in an endnote which, like all others, is fairly well concealed (there are no\nsuperscripted numbers in the main text, instead one has to find notes “in reverse,” in the\nback of the book, through citations keyed to specific page numbers and quotations)—Furia has left the matter frustratingly\nunresolved.",

                "text": "[1.4] Excepting the above complaint, Furia’s handling of general historical and biographical matters is done quite well.\nNonetheless, there is one problem that will disturb the more discriminating popular-music scholar, and it concerns a lack of\nprudence when determining the “hit” status of a song. For example, Furia offers these summary remarks at the beginning of\nhis book: “More than half—451—of Berlin’s [copyrighted] songs became hits, and\n282 of these reached that coveted circle of the ‘Top Ten.’ More amazing still is that 35 of his songs reached the\npinnacle of the ‘Number One’ most popular song of their day” (page 2). The problem with the assertion is simply that “hit lists,” as\nwe think of them today, did not exist for much of Berlin’s career. Beginning in 1935 (nearly three decades after Berlin’s\nfirst song), Your Hit Parade was broadcast on radio (and later on television); it\noffered a national survey, with chart positions based on various factors including sales of records and\nsheet music (although its evolving rankings formula was never clearly articulated). Thus, from 1935 onward, one can at least\nsay that a song was number X according to that particular source. For songs released beforehand, however, there is no\nconsistent way to derive such a ranking. Variety and other publications may provide ad hoc sales figures, or print very specific charts (for example, of record sales by a given company\nin a given market), but they offer nothing that would enable one to say, so generally, that a song was “number X ” nationally. True, some books have tried to conjure numbers for songs of these\nearlier periods—e.g., Joel Whitburn’s Pop Memories 1890–1954 . (11) There is much misinformation to be found in books\nlike this, however, which fabricate single-number chart positions; rankings often are based on sources that may have\nreported company-biased or only regional information, and, in extreme cases, information may be merely anecdotal. I have no\nidea where Furia found all 451 of his chart rankings, as he never volunteers the\ninformation (a scholarly lapse in itself); but if he found them in a book like Whitburn’s, then he (and others\ninterested in similar research) should ponder a detailed critique of Whitburn’s methodological shortcomings, issued by Tim\nBrooks.

For example, he remarks that “You’re Just In Love”\n“topped Your Hit Parade for weeks” (page 247). In lieu of any other information, most people would\nsurely interpret “topped” literally, and assume that the song was perched at no. 1 for a\nperiod. But, in fact, it rose no higher than no. 3 during its thirteen weeks among the ten weekly entries of early\n1951. (13) Finally, other statements about chart successes seem curiously\nchosen, even if they are not entirely wrong. For example, to illustrate the popularity of Berlin’s songs from the movie Top Hat (1935), Furia notes that “By September 1935, three of Berlin’s songs—‘Cheek to Cheek,’ ‘Top Hat,’ and ‘Isn’t This a Lovely Day?’—held the first, second, and fourth spot, respectively, on Your Hit\nParade ” (page 179). These rankings are accurate (although they are actually from the broadcast of 5\nOctober). But I find it mystifying that he failed to cite the more impressive feat: that, the prior week (28 September), all\nfive Berlin songs from this single film were among Your Hit Parade’s fifteen\nentries, with “Cheek to Cheek” spending the first of its five consecutive weeks at no. 1.

For example, Furia describes “Say It With Music” (1921) as\nstarting “with a cellolike strain that deftly matches long a and u vowels to lush whole notes:\nS ay ----it with m u ----sic [rest] / B eau ----tiful m u ----sic [rest].” He emphasizes also the\ninternal rhymes woven into the same song, as with the phrase “A m el ody m el low played on the\nc el lo . . . h el ps Mister Cupid al ong” (page 91). Other categories of rhymes that receive\nattention include “feminine” ones, i.e., “two-syllable rhymes where the last syllable is unaccented,” as in “ bon net . . . up on it,” in “Easter Parade” (1933; see page 159). A compendium\nof insights is provided in Furia’s comments on the lyrics of “Alexander’s Ragtime\nBand” (1911); he points out Berlin’s intentional distortion of syllabic emphasis which forces certain\nrhymes; the “packed rhymes and alliteration” of certain phrases; and the way Berlin fits “syncopated music with jagged rhymes and\nfragmented but perfectly conversational syntax” (see pages 42–43). Through his dissections and reconnections of words and phrases,\nFuria shows the ingeniousness of Berlin’s lyrics, which elsewhere have been too readily dismissed as less artistic than those of\nIra Gershwin, Lorenz Hart, and certain other contemporaries.",

                "text": "[2.3] Second, Furia often supports his assertions about Berlin’s lyric writing through information on how particular lyrics\nevolved. For example, to demonstrate how intent Berlin could be on finding the most appropriate words for his songs, Furia\nrecounts the story of how Berlin “sweated to find” the perfect keyword for “My Wife’s Gone to the Country” (1909). It came in\nthe simple shout “Hurrah!,” but as Berlin himself is quoted as explaining, that elusive word “gave the whole idea of the song in\none quick wallop. It gave the singer a chance to hoot with sheer joy. It invited the roomful to join\nin the hilarious shout. It everlastingly put the catch line over” (page 31). In other\ninstances, Furia nicely illuminates lyrics through the broader context he provides. A case in point is “I Used to Be Color\nBlind” (1938), from the film Carefree (see pages 187–88). Furia points out that the song was\noriginally to have been part of a dream sequence, in which the “reality” of black-and-white film\nwould give way to a “dreamy” Technicolor sequence. Ultimately, everything was shot in black-and-white, but the proposed shift in\nfilm type had prompted Berlin to write a song that couched love in terms of a prismatic epiphany. His original lyrics included\nthe phrase: “I never could see the green in the grass, the gold in the moon, the blue in the skies.” He\nfound the phrasing to be “redundant and negative,” however, so revised it to: “I used to\nbe color blind, / But I met you and now I find / There’s green in the grass, / There’s gold in the moon, / There’s blue in the\nskies.” The new phrasing conveys, much more positively, the transforming effects of love.\nMoreover, it reveals the “subtle intricacies of artistry” that lay beneath the “seeming\nnaturalness of [Berlin’s] blend of words and music.”",

One theme to which he occasionally\nreturns is Berlin’s “characteristic knack of refracting the big historical picture through the lens of the particular individual”\n(page 78). For instance, during the First World War, which witnessed songs of such sweeping conviction as George M. Cohan’s\n“Over There,” Berlin offered more personal fare, e.g., “They Were All Out of Step But Jim” (1918), in which a proud mother watches\nher son march off to war, and excuses (as only a mother could) the fact that he is marching to\na different rhythm than the rest; and “Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning” (1918), in which\nthe protagonist sings of the agony of reveille, and his plan of revenge against the bugler, in a manner humorously familiar to\nall soldiers of the time (of which Berlin himself was one). On a more serious subject, in “Supper Time” (1933) Berlin managed to\npersonalize the savage injustice of lynching, by presenting “the anguished lament of the victim’s\nwife, who must now attend to the prosaic task of feeding her children and telling them their\nfather is dead” (see pages 155–58). Rather than engaging in overt moralizing or politically pointed language, “the lyric focuses\npoignantly on the predicament of the mother and wife as she forces herself to start her\ndaily routine.”",

            "2.5": {
                "text": "[2.5] Another general insight tendered by Furia is that Berlin’s writing for the film musical, with its microphoned sound reproduction, actually changed his vowel usages, and thus the\nvery sound of his lyrics. “When writing for a performer who would sing a song on stage, a songwriter had to\nsupply long notes and open vowels so the singer . . . could project a song to the back\nof the balcony. With microphones and prerecording, however, . . . Berlin could concentrate on [a singer’s] ability to enunciate\nsyllables and follow the trickiest rhythms. Using shorter vowels and clipped consonants,”\nperformers who were singing could sound more like themselves talking (page 174). One of many illustrations\noffered is “Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails” (1935), written for the film Top\nHat , with its “marvelously clipped phrases” such as “I’m dudein’ up my shirt front, / Puttin’ in the shirt studs,\n/ Polishin’ my nails.” “Cheek to Cheek,” from the same film, provides another example with its opening word, “Heaven . . . ”\nBy beginning with this evocative word, with its “not so singable short and long closed e ’s and aspirating [ h ],” Berlin gives “the song a breathless immediacy” (page 175).\nFuria reminds us that “[s]ongwriters who wrote primarily for the stage, such as Rodgers\nand Hammerstein, would never enjoy such freedom. Hammerstein fretted, for example, over ending a song, for dramatic reasons,\nwith the unsingable line, ‘all the rest is talk’” (page 174).",

                "text": "[2.6] Fourth and finally, Furia makes intriguing connections between Berlin and various literary figures, some of which are\nnot initially apparent, though all are adequately supported by his commentary. Consider his coupling of Berlin and the\neighteenth-century satirist, Alexander Pope (page 96). Furia explains that Berlin actually had an “abiding interest” in Pope’s\npoetry, no doubt fostered by Berlin’s friendship with Algonquin writers like Dorothy\nParker and George S. Kaufman. He asserts that [Berlin] felt a special affinity for Pope’s lifelong dedication to the    “lean, compact heroic couplets”—the most constrictive of    poetic forms. Pope’s ability to compress his observations on    politics, manners, and art within the confines of ten    syllables parallels Berlin’s devotion to the restrictions of    the thirty-two bar chorus. Like the formula of the popular    song, the couplet demanded ingenuity on the part of the poet    in placing accent and pause, in avoiding banality of syntax    and rhyme, and in achieving natural, even colloquial,    expression within this most rigid of poetic forms . . . Just as Berlin thought that Pope “would have made a brilliant lyric writer,” Berlin himself tried his hand at writing couplets.\nMoreover, Berlin would also have admired Pope as the most commercially    successful of English poets, one who was alert to the    shifting fashions of his time, to developments in the    publishing business, and changes in copyright laws. Like    Irving Berlin, “Pope became his own publisher, managed his    rights with care, manipulated the booksellers, and planned    his own career . . . [He wrote] the most accomplished poems    of his age, arrange[d] for their publication at the most    advantageous juncture, and harvest[ed] the returns carefully” (pages 96–97, partly quoting Pat Rogers).",

                "text": "[2.7] Although Furia’s engagement with lyrics is, in the main, perhaps the most commendable trait of his book, occasionally his\ninterpretations tend toward the peculiar. For example, in order to demonstrate how much Berlin improved as a lyricist over the\nyears, Furia goes out of his way to emphasize the ineptness of his first lyrics, for “Marie from Sunny Italy” (1907). After some\ncritical remarks about the song’s forced rhymes and syllabic padding (none of which I will dispute), Furia claims that “[a]\nmore serious flaw . . . is that Berlin does not adapt his lyric to the structure of the music”\n(page 21). He points out that the music is in a verse-refrain pattern, and explains that, “[t]raditionally, the verse was where the lyricist told a story, while the chorus consisted of a brief lyrical exclamation.” He\nadds that the music (not written by Berlin, in this case) fully emphasizes these sectional\ndifferences: the composer used “a Cuban habanera rhythm in the verse, coupled with a minor-mode\nmelody, to give it an ethnic flavor, while in the chorus he used a more American ‘pop’ melody and a rhythm derived from\nragtime.” (14) According to Furia, however, Berlin’s lyrics ignore\nthe form; they are “all of a piece, an extended plea by the lover for his Marie that ignores the musical contrast between verse and\nchorus. [ . . . ] Berlin evinces little grasp of the musical divisions of the song.” At the risk of sounding like Berlin’s\narch-defender, I believe that Furia has missed an important separation built into the lyrics. The verse is all about a\nsummons: the protagonist is waiting for his true love to appear; he is standing on the street,\npleading for her to “raise [the] window,” to “come out tonight” and meet him under the “summer\nmoon.” He wishes to sing a “serenade” to her, and he has brought his “mandolin” for accompaniment. In contrast, the refrain is\nprecisely the song that he sings to her. The lyric in no way “ignores the musical\ncontrast between verse and chorus,” but instead is predicated upon them; the two parts are not, together,\n“an extended plea by the lover,” but rather the verse offers the plea, and the refrain is the promised song (or, more\ncolloquially, the “payoff”). In sum, Berlin seems to have “grasp[ed] . . . the musical divisions of the song” quite competently.",

I\nwill begin by reminding the reader that the song is in AABA form, with each A section beginning in minor and turning, at its very\nend, to the relative major. In contrast, the B section (or bridge) is in the relative major throughout—although mode\nmixture rears its head, and melodic ♭ 6 ˆ is harmonized by the minor subdominant. The A sections tend toward longer note values,\nwhile the B section accelerates the pace rhythmically. Finally, despite touches of minor,\nall sections are somewhat positive lyrically, with the A sections speaking of “blue skies smiling at\nme” and “bluebirds singing a song.” The B section, with its affirmation of the major mode and more-animated rhythms,\nintensifies the emotion with lines like “never saw the sun shining so bright.” In the\nending section, all seems right with the world, as the protagonist pronounces: “Blue days, all of them\ngone. Nothing but blue skies from now on.” (Incidentally, all of this positiveness seems quite in line with Furia’s assertion that\nthe song was written “to celebrate the birth of [Berlin’s] first daughter” [page 121].)",

The emphasis on participles—“shining,” “going,” “noticing”—draws “nothing” into its orbit and hints that the singer’s present happiness may only be fleeting, as does the melancholy chromatic note on the word “shining.” The note of mutability, at the song’s emotional pivot, turns the joyous “blue” of “blue skies” and “blue birds” into the “blue” of the blues as the bridge turns into the final A-section: Blue days—all of them gone—nothing but blue skies from now on. Unlike “blue skies” and “blue birds,” these last “blue days” are the departed days of sadness, but the preceding\nrecognition that “when you’re in love” the days go “hurrying by” also hints that despondent times can return. While the\nsong ends on a note of affirmation, the lingering rhyme on “gone” underscores that melancholy awareness (pages 122–23).",

The problem, of course, is that although Berlin (and other period\nsongwriters) did tend to fall back on an ingrained thirty-two bar, AABA or ABAB template, there were many other patterns\nemployed. To see how non-rigid Berlin could be, consider “I’m Sorry for Myself,” from the film Second Fiddle (1939), published as an eighteen-measure song that might best be\nsegmented according to the phrasing 4+4+10 (with the final melody note held for four bars).

For instance, regarding “Cheek to Cheek” (1935), from the film Top Hat , Furia opines that Berlin “compensates for the lack of a verse by\nwriting a chorus more than twice the length of the normal thirty-two bars” (page 175).\nThis is literally true, and certainly the song’s internal patter-like section does expand the form. One cannot dismiss,\nhowever, the fact that much of the song’s “extra length” is an attribute of notation, and thus\nsomething about which Berlin, who reportedly could not read or write music, would have been\nunaware. That is, as written, the quarter note carries the beat in the song; its familiar opening phrase (of sixteen measures) is\nwritten in long note values, including several notes that are held for five beats. It\ncould have been notated as eight measures, however, with the eighth note carrying the beat.\nIndeed, its opening (sixteen-bar) phrase presents 39 syllables of lyrics, which is not far afield from the number of syllables\nfitted to some eight-bar phrases. (16) The point is, “Cheek to\nCheek” is “twice the length” of other songs not due to the perception of rhythms and phrasing, but due largely to a notated\nmeasure count—something of which Berlin would have been oblivious. A more striking case of form expansion could have been\nmade if Furia had only looked to another song from the same film: “The\nPiccolino,” which has a truly arresting, 98-measure design, which might be diagrammed A12 A'12 B16 A12 C9 C'9 C\"10 A\"12+6.",

Furia says that here Berlin used the unusual “ABCD pattern, where each of the four eight-bar sections introduces a\nnew melodic phrase, making the song as constantly fascinating as the American girl it celebrates” (page 76). I suspect that he\nderived his formal description from Wilder, who declared the same scheme; (17) if so, one might not blame Furia from trusting a\nwriter who was himself a songwriter. Still, the ABCD description fails to capture the fact\nthat the refrain’s initial two, eight-bar phrases are exactly alike except for their endings;\nthus AA'BC is much more apt, making the form of the song similar to other Berlin fare, such as “Because I Love You”\n(1926). (18) One might also take issue with Furia’s somewhat homely manner of\nconnecting the music with the topic of the lyrics, by calling the form “as constantly fascinating as the American girl it\ncelebrates.” As an alternative interpretation, I might point out that Berlin’s frequent use of an accented-beat neighboring-note\nmotive (given as a quarter note followed by a half note) ties everything together melodically, making one segment of the song\nsimilar to most others, just as social trends mandate that any given cover girl shares traits with\nmost others. (In fact, Furia had just discussed some of the common period images of women, as\nfound on the covers of Vogue and other magazines, making my comparison perhaps more apt than his.) Of course, it is not\ndifficult to construct fanciful metaphors which associate text and tones; but sometimes a more expressly musical description can\nbetter capture the way a song directs a listener’s attention. To wit, regarding “The Girl\non the Magazine Cover,” instead of claiming that listener interest is maintained due to the\nintroduction of “new” material (which, after all, could be merely desultory in an amateur songwriter’s hands), I would point out\nthat a listener may well be carried purposefully through the two ending sections\nbecause of their large-scale melodic arch, which rises to D5 ( 5 ˆ ) at the end of the B section, and then gradually\nfalls to G4 ( 1 ˆ ) at the end of the (concluding) C section.",

The chord is not\ntonicized; instead, these measures hover on that single accompanying harmony, with appropriate melodic alterations,\nbefore heading to the dominant chord in preparation for a repeat of the initial section. In even the most immediate of contexts,\nthere is no “key change” here. Another example comes in Furia’s reference to a striking feature of\n“Lady of the Evening” (1922). He explains that “Berlin introduces a minor seventh interval\nwhich, played against a major chord gives a ‘sprinkle of theatrical mystery’ to the phrase” (page 98, partly quoting\nWilder). Mentally combining a major triad and a minor seventh, a musician is likely to wonder:\n“what’s so ‘mysterious’ about a dominant-seventh chord?” Of course, what Furia does not reveal is\nthat it is a special dominant-seventh sonority: the one derived from adding (in a major key) melodic ♭ 7 ˆ to the tonic triad. This\nsonority—used for its color and not for its function as V 7 of IV—is not uncommon in the repertory, and here it certainly\nimparts a non-Western veneer to a song that speaks of “fold[ing] . . . tents just like the Arabs . . . ” The affect would have been clearer had Furia quoted Wilder’s comments more fully, as\nthe latter actually wrote that this particular minor-seventh interval “gives a modal quality to this passage” and thus a\n“sprinkle of theatrical mystery.” (19)",

Passing between keys related in this fashion is quite fluid,\nand, given that Berlin was actually dictating the song’s melody and not its harmonies to an arranger\n(as Furia indicates), perhaps he was not even aware of implicit modal shifts within the\nrefrain. (20) By “shifting meters,” Furia\nmeans the change between a 4 4 verse and a 8 6 refrain. However, the extent to which these meters differ is blurred by the\nrhythms: the 4 4 section makes extensive use of the dotted-eighth/sixteenth rhythm, which of course is often played with a triplet feel in popular music; thus, the transition to the 8 6 section, with its extensive use of the quarter/eighth pattern, almost passes without notice. As before, Furia has fixated a bit too much on the notation, rather than the sound, of the song.",

She adds the dismissal: “B or I flat, C or Y flat /\nTry it hon’ but not in my flat.” The pun on the two meanings of “flat”—a musical alteration and an apartment—is shrewd.\nFuria, however, claims that it is “the first of [Berlin’s] many musical and lyrical\n‘puns’” as “the final word ‘flat’ actually falls on a flatted note” (page 37). Once again, Furia focuses too much on a\nnotational aspect that might not have been recognized by Berlin. Perhaps Berlin did identify the sound of “blue notes” as being\n“flat”—who can say? But that is irrelevant, as this “flat” note arises as a descending, chromatic passing tone, of which there\nwere three others in the verse, including one which occurred on the very same notes. In\nno instance but this one did the passing tone happen to accompany the word “flat” (or a synonym). [4] Songography",

(21) Bloom provides a chronological\nlisting (1907–77) that divides entries, under each year, into “show songs” and “pop songs,” the\nformer including songs for stage and film productions, the latter including essentially\neverything else. The list encompasses roughly 850 copyrighted entries, although there are some redundancies, as when songs were\ninterpolated into more than one show (e.g., “Oh, That Beautiful Rag” appears under two shows in 1910). Given that Bloom’s list\nthus contains fewer than 850 unique entries, and that Furia claims in the main text that Berlin\nregistered 899 songs for copyright (page 2), one wonders about these “missing” songs. What\nare they, and why are they not listed? The number of omitted songs may be even larger than Furia suggests, for a similar song\ncatalogue by Steven Suskin had nearly 930 copyrighted entries, including unpublished songs (which Bloom also seems to list) as\nwell as song parodies and songs later revised (which Bloom seems to list as well, though\nperhaps not as completely). (22) The lack of consistency in cataloguing (and counting) Berlin’s songs is\nnothing new; it has been an unfortunate malady of Berlin scholarship for some time. Furia makes matters worse,\nhowever, when he repeats the exaggerated claim that Berlin actually “wrote thousands of songs” (page 2)—most, therefore,\nbeing non-copyrighted. Such a number has never been substantiated. In fact, Berlin seems to have\ncopyrighted most of what he ever wrote (even private songs for his grandchildren!),\nand while some (especially early) songs may have been lost—Hamm has documented about a hundred of\nthese (23) —it is simply unbelievable that thousands of songs are missing.",

For example, a person consulting the inventory for practical research purposes would have been\nbetter served if Bloom had indicated, perhaps with a simple asterisk, which of the songs were unpublished (and there are\nseveral of these); and also, with a different symbol, which songs had been already\ncited on his list, so that later interpolations would be more readily identifiable. True, Bloom usually lists\nsongs only once, and not again, under later shows which also used them; e.g., for the movie Alexander’s Ragtime Band (1938), he lists only three new songs written for the film, not the many\nolder ones that were also incorporated (such as the title song). But, alas, he is not consistent, and thus “Easter Parade,” from\nthe 1933 stage show, As Thousands Cheer , is included also under the 1942 film Holiday Inn .

Its glaring defect is in its expressly musical commentary; and although,\nstrictly speaking, this represents a small portion of the whole, it takes on additional significance\ngiven the relatively few sources which have addressed Berlin’s songs in musical terms.\nEventually, those interested in Berlin’s songs will have recourse to this volume, and they may leave the encounter\nwith some odd (or even incorrect) impressions.
