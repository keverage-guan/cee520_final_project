In all,\nmore than 250 sketch leaves appear in this large-format (approximately 9 by 12\ninches) publication from A-R Editions. The editor has provided an introductory\nessay (pp. 3–19) and a pair of tables in which the sketches are identified\ninsofar as possible, locating the corresponding passages in the 1987 reprint of\nthe full score. There are also three short essays by Ramuz scholars Philippe\nGirard, Alain Rochat, and Noël Cordonier about the evolution of the text; each\nis provided in French and in English translation.

A discussion of “Criteria for\nEstablishing the Ordering of the Sketches” (pp. 10–11) and “The Musical Origins\nof Histoire du soldat ” (pp. 11–12) provides a start toward the\nchallenging task of untangling the web of source materials. Carr also discusses\nexamples of rebarring in a series of sketches for the “March du soldat” (pp.\n13–16) and explores questions of motivic linkage among the “march” movements (p.\n17), thus providing some snapshots of the kinds of discoveries that await the\ncareful reader of Stravinsky’s sketches.",

As\nwas previously noted by Robert Craft, important thematic ideas for the work\noriginated in sketches made for a setting of “Antony and Cleopatra,” a\ncollaboration with André Gide that Stravinsky abandoned after several months of\nwork in 1917. (1) Stravinsky apparently first introduced the subject of Histoire to Ramuz during the winter of that year. According to Richard Taruskin, the\nfirst clear reference to their collaboration comes in a letter from Stravinsky\ndated 28 February 1918. (2) Ramuz wrote a three-page synopsis of the story with\nthe provisional title “Le soldat et le diable” on the very same day. (3) By 6 April, Stravinsky had completed a version of the Music to Scene One (“Petits\nairs au bord du ruisseau”). Composition progressed rapidly, and the work was\npremiered on 28 September 1918 in Lausanne.",

During the same year,\nan abbreviated arrangement of the work (for clarinet, violin, and piano) was\npublished, and another (for piano solo) followed in 1922.

                "text": "[5] Even this cursory account of the genesis of Histoire is not without its\nproblems. Unfortunately, most sources contain contradictions, errors, and\nomissions. For example, Craft’s account of the revisions has appeared in two\nslightly varied versions. (5) In the latter, he states that\n“Stravinsky began\nrevising the score soon after this unique performance [the premiere on 28\nSeptember 1918], until only the Scene by the Brook and the Tango remained\nunchanged.” He further informs us that both the Lausanne premiere and the 1920\nLondon performance of the concert suite were conducted by Ansermet from a full\nscore copied by Stravinsky’s wife Catherine, into which numerous corrections\nwere later added. (6) Presumably, this is the\n“conductor’s score” mentioned by\nCarr, currently located at the Stadtbibliothek Winterthur, from which she\nprovides her table of the dates “as written by Stravinsky”(p. 4). A comparison\nof the table to the corresponding facsimile pages confirms that these dates\ncorrespond exactly to the ones on the sketch leaves—down to the occasional\ninclusion of both Old Style and New Style dating (the Gregorian and Julian\ncalendars were 13 days out of phase at this time, and Stravinsky sometimes used\nboth). Many of the dates are accompanied by the composer’s signature, some with\nthe designation “Morges,” the location of the family dwelling at the time the\nsketches were completed. This leaves us wondering whether Catherine’s copy of\nthe score was annotated with dates from the sketches by the composer, or whether\nCraft is incorrect about the hand in which this score is written. Craft also\nrefers to another score, requested by Stravinsky for a performance in Paris (7\nNovember 1923), which had been “used by Scherchen and myself. . . [and] has many\nmore corrections than the one you sent me.” Craft says that score was in use in\nLeipzig at that time. (7) Carr writes\n“The copyist’s manuscript of 1920, with\nannotations by Stravinsky and others, is missing. This manuscript was used as a\nsource for the Chester editions of 1987 and 1924” (p. 19, note 68). It is\nunclear, in short, exactly how many manuscript copies of the score exist, and\nwho wrote them.",

In this regard, Carr’s book represents both a great step forward and a\nfrustrating failure. On the one hand, it provides access to a large body of\nprimary source material that has never before been readily available. Although\nCarr admits the possibility that some sketches may have become separated from\nthe ones reproduced here (p. 9), she claims the edition contains “all the\nexisting sketches for Histoire du soldat ” (p. 17). On the other hand, issues of\nchronology and interpretation are only minimally addressed. There is no thorough\naccount of the physical properties of the sketches. The dimensions of each\nsketch leaf are given, but there is no description of paper types, the physical\nmakeup of the two bound sketchbooks, and exact locations of the various pages\nwithin Stravinsky’s other bound sketchbooks are sometimes vague. Regrettably,\nthere is no concordance with the catalogs of either the Paul Sacher Stiftung or\nthe Rychenberg Stiftung.

                "text": "[7] Let us make a brief tour of the sketches in order to clarify what this\nfacsimile edition might enable us to learn. The sketches are divided into eight\ngroups of varying sizes, and as Carr explains (pp. 10–11), it is very difficult\nto establish a strictly chronological ordering among them. However, some general\nconclusions could have been drawn. Some of the sketches in Group One are surely\namong the earliest, because they include instrumentation indications that\nreflect a different ensemble than that used in Histoire . These are assumed (by\nCraft and Carr) to belong to Stravinsky’s work on “Antony and Cleopatra,” and\nwould thus date from 1917. Others, however, clearly relate to much later\nefforts. For example, Figure 1.30 is a short score version of the Little\nChorale—the very last movement to be completed (the date in the “conductor’s\nscore” is 23 September 1918, a mere five days before the premiere). Throughout\nthis group we find early versions of a number of the work’s most prominent and\nmemorable themes: the chromatic melody from Rehearsal 10 of the Soldier’s March\nmakes several appearances (in Figure 1.1, it is scored for three trumpets;\nFigures 1.5 and 1.10 include less fully developed versions), and the\nquintessential rhythmic motive from the Music to Scene One (five bars after\nRehearsal 4) appears in Figure 1.13, and so on. There are significant bits of\nthe Tango, the Ragtime, and the Waltz, as well as recognizable bits of the\nTriumphal March of the Devil, the Devil’s Dance, and the Royal March. It is\npossible that some of these sketches may relate to revisions made after the\nfirst performance. For example, Figures 1.35 through 1.41 relate to the\nTriumphant March of the Devil, the instrumentation of which Stravinsky was still\nrevising for performances in 1923. (8) What is crucial to know about this group\nis that all of these sketch leaves (excepting the last four) are on the same\ntype of paper, all of uniform (or very nearly uniform) size, with six holes\npunched in the margin. They were probably kept in a binder, or in several\nbinders. It is highly unlikely that the order in which they are presented here\nis the order in which they were written. Placing them in chronological order may\nrequire some very careful reconstruction.",

In several cases, Stravinsky’s\nwriting continues across an opening—suggesting that the writing took place after\nthe leaves were bound. But the sketchbook may have been rebound at some point:\nFigure 3.35 (the last leaf on which musical sketches appear) is written upside\ndown, while Figure 3.36 (the verso of the same leaf) is right side up. The\nlatter leaf is dated 1 May 1918, and bears the fascinating inscription in\nItalian “parent of my first aria” above an early version of the “Princess\nMotive.” Stravinsky himself noted a resemblance between this theme and the Dies irae, although he said the chant was not on his mind when he initially invented\nthe theme—and the sketches corroborate his claim: the earlier sketch version of\nthe theme is indeed less closely related to the chant melody than the\nrevision. (9) Here again, a detailed description of the stitching, the\ngatherings, and the condition of the covers would be welcome. Occasionally, it\nis impossible to read some of the fainter pencil entries on some of the\nfacsimile pages. Figure 3.7 is an example: Carr finds what she believes to be\npossible early sketches for the Great Chorale here, but I cannot make out enough\nnotes to confirm her hypothesis. The notation I can read looks like that used in\nthe Tango (as in Figure 3.35). Among the most interesting entries are several\nleaves devoted to work on the Great Chorale (Figures 3.28 through 3.33). Here\none can study some primitive versions of the melody and bass lines, multiple\nattempts to fashion the movement’s cadences, and some fascinating changes in the\ndetails of scoring and meter. (10) However, as we shall see, Craft is incorrect in claiming that the entire chorale\nis to be found here. (11)",

Once again,\nonly the barest of physical description is supplied, leaving us to wonder about\nmany aspects of the book’s condition. Carr has discovered that a series of pages\nwas at one point removed (they were presented to Stravinsky’s patroness Eugenia Errazuriz on 6 February 1920). These leaves are now at the Paul Sacher Stiftung\nin Basel. In Carr’s edition, they appear in facsimile in their rightful place,\nreunited with the Winterthur Sketchbook. The sketchbook begins with a sketches\nand a draft of the Music to Scene One, the end of which is dated 6 April 1918.\nThis is the earliest ending date for any of the movements of the work, but\nclearly these sketches are more highly developed than the primitive ones in\nGroup One. The next section of the (reconstructed) sketchbook consists of\nsketches for the Ragtime and Waltz. The end of the Ragtime is dated 15 August\n1918 (Figure 4a.14); the end of the Waltz bears no date. Another set of sketches\nfor the Great Chorale follows. Here, Stravinsky includes timings for the spoken\ntexts, as well as several important revisions to the central phrases, and (for\nthe first time), several drafts of the final phrases. A few details remain to be\nchanged before the published version is reached, but clearly these sketches\npost-date those of the “Croquis” book. The next batch of sketches develops the\nRoyal March—which is initially titled “Pasa-doble” (Figure 4.28). Another\nlengthy run of pages contains sketches and drafts for the Soldier’s March, the\nend of which is dated 25 June 1918. This would suggest that the March was\ncompleted before the Ragtime, which precedes it in this sketchbook. Together\nwith the evidence that various groups of pages are separately paginated (in what\nI believe to be Stravinsky’s hand), this strongly implies that the Winterthur\nSketchbook was rebound after its original use, or that its components were first\ngathered for binding only after they were written. Undated sketches and drafts\nfor the Tango follow, after which the sketchbook concludes with a few jottings\nrelating to the Music to Scene Two and a portrait sketch of René Auberjonois\ndated 1917 (Figure 4.85). This last is conclusive evidence that the ordering of\nthe contents of the book as it now exists has little to do with the chronology\nof their creation.",

Some look to me a bit like the\ncimbalom notation Stravinsky employed in Renard and the Ragtime for Eleven\nInstruments, and indeed, the abbreviation “Cimb” appears twice in Figure 5.10.\nThese sketches do not look like they relate directly to the Ragtime for Eleven,\nbut one should remember that in fact, that work was completely sketched\n(although not orchestrated) by 21 March 1918—that is, before work on Histoire had progressed beyond its earliest phase.

                "text": "[12] Group Six consists of miscellaneous early sketches from what is known as\nSketchbook III (there are ten numbered sketchbooks in the Igor Stravinsky\ncollection at the Sacher Stiftung). The four pages of sketches reproduced in\nCarr’s edition are all early ones for the Music to Scene Two; all are in\nkeyboard texture, and interestingly, the first is explicitly labeled “piano” in\nRussian (Figure 6.1). These tentative sketches, and a listing of instruments in\nFigure 1.6 (seven players, but with piano listed instead of bassoon!), suggest\nthat Stravinsky considered an alternative to the famous Histoire ensemble. (13) [13] Group Seven consists of two sketches from leaves filed with Sketchbook IV.\nCarr is unable to identify the first (as am I); she suggests that the “Valse”\nfragment in Figure 7.2 might or might not be associated with the Waltz in Histoire . I tend to think it is not. [14] The final ten sketches (Group Eight) are somewhat easier to identify. Part\nof the first is nearly identical to material in Figure 5.7, and both clearly\nrelate to the Music to Scene Two. However, the sketch immediately above this is\nmarked for clarinetto piccolo in E ♭ , and probably has nothing whatever to do\nwith Histoire . Other ideas here are tentative experiments that are difficult to\nidentify with any degree of certainty, although most of Carr’s attempts seem\nplausible. The entries she does not identify are of considerable interest: some\nmay reflect paths not taken, while others could be jottings related to other\nworks. Ideally, one would want to consider the content of pages before and after\nthe ones reproduced here, for it is the contextual relationships that are often\nmost valuable in assessing his entries in these sketchbooks, which tend to be\nquite discontinuous. In general, Stravinsky seems to have used these books to\nset down initial ideas; when he was ready to do more sustained sketching, he\noften moved to a different format.",

                "text": "[15] As noted above, Carr provides two tables in which the contents of the sketch\nleaves are identified. The first is organized by Group, and follows the order in\nwhich the facsimile pages are laid out. The second is arranged to correlate with\nthe 1987 edition of the full score, so that one can readily locate all of the\nsketches that correspond with any given movement in the work. Both tables\ninclude translations of most (but not all) of Stravinsky’s notations in various\nlanguages. Unfortunately, a number of the instrumental designations are not\nmentioned—and they can be important. For example, in Figure 8.1, the sketch Carr\nbelieves may be one of the earliest versions of the opening of the Music to\nScene Two is marked “cl. La” (clarinet in A), whereas the published version is\nfor B ♭ clarinet; the Russian expressions at the bottom of this leaf are not\ntranslated. Here and elsewhere, designations for instruments that do not belong\nto the Histoire ensemble (piccolo, clarinet in E ♭ , horns, cimbalom) are\nsometimes passed over. There are a number of trivial errors in the book: for\nexample, on p. 11, Erik Satie’s name is misspelled, and on p. 47, the French\nterm for snare drum is misspelled. A more significant error is the wrong date at\nthe end of Musical Example 1 (p. 9), which should read 12 May (not 12 March).",

Carr’s edition provides an opportunity to\nbecome acquainted with the complexities of Stravinsky’s creative process, and to\nspend many hours at the composer’s elbow (as it were). With some patience, one\ncan compare and contrast numerous versions of the intricately interwoven themes\nand motives of Histoire , and thus gain a greater appreciation for the work’s\nspecial integrity. Along with Carr’s sketch tables, the essays of the literary\nscholars provide a basic understanding of the fabulously complex process of\nrewriting and revision both Ramuz and Stravinsky undertook as the work grew. Of\ncourse, access to the original documents will still be necessary in order to\nanswer many of the harder questions, if only because no facsimile can convey the\nfull essence of an original document. Differences in paper type, shades of\ncoloration in the writing, erasures, and many other details jump out at one when\nthe original document is viewed, whereas these features may not be visible at\nall in a facsimile. Even so, Stravinsky fans should celebrate the appearance of\nthis publication. We hope it will be only one among many more, and that its\nappearance will foster close study and deeper appreciation for the composer’s\nworks and his working methods.",
