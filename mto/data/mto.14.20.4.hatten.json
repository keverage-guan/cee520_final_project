    "abstract": "Schenkerian analysis gives priority to structural harmonic and voice-leading closure in tonal works, but composers have found other ways to simulate (and dissimulate) structural closure for dramatically expressive purposes. After a brief look at an example by Beethoven (the coda to the first movement of op. 2, no. 1), I focus on interpreting closure in two Romantic piano pieces. In his Prelude in A minor, op. 28, no. 2, Chopin plays with three different closural gambits: dissolution to silence, a false Picardy third close on the dominant, and a final V7–i cadence in A minor. The latter two options are also marked by shifts in level of discourse, and may suggest two commentaries (beatific consolation vs. tragic desolation) on the funereal trajectory of the work. In the penultimate dance of hisDavidsbündlertänzeop. 6, Schumann achieves both thematic and tonal closure, complete with the cyclic return of waltz no. 2 and a passionately tragic coda suggestive of Florestan. But he expressively undercuts that strong closure to allow Eusebius the last word. The final waltz (no. 18) overflows not only its own formal boundaries, but also the formal closure of the set implied by no. 17, reversing the tragic coda to achieve a transcendently positive epiphany. I propose and illustrate performance options that can help project the expressive closural dramas in these two works by Chopin and Schumann.",

In his graph of the first movement in Tonwille 2 , Schenker ( 2004 , 73) brackets the descending sixth in the theme, also noting its structural use in the transition (transposed to E ♭ –G), and showing its ultimate resolution in the last bar of the movement. Although the concept of the Ursatz does not appear this early, Schenker is clearly working out the Urlinie concept from structural motivic lines (here, combined with a structural stepwise ascent that he will later relegate to the Anstieg as anacrusis to the Kopfton marking the beginning of the Urlinie ). This sonata movement’s motivic descent serves to illustrate what he will later hypostasize as a 5-line. Without an Ursatz , we cannot know for sure where Schenker would have placed his definitive closure, but presumably it would have been at measure 140 (near the end of the recapitulation, just before the codetta and subsequent coda). In his graph he brackets a stepwise descent of a fifth from C to F supported by V–I at that point. In the short coda (measures 146–52), his Roman numerals (see Example 1)  are clearly too dissonant to form consonant ( Ursatz ) harmonic support for his bracketed Urlinie . He does not comment on the (partially chromatic) parallel tenths the Urlinie forms with the bass, although, as Karen Bottge pointed out to me, his ninth-chord Roman numerals imply that he is aurally retaining each Urlinie pitch into the following chord, producing a 10–9 linear intervallic progression between bass and soprano. Schenker refers to the final descent as “a last full-fledged unrolling of the falling fifth-progression c3–f2, suitable for a coda, and the basic feature of the movement accompanies even this one to the very end!” ( Schenker [1922] 2004 , 76). This comment suggests Schenker’s concern for what I have called thematic closure, but the (previously unresolved) motivic descent of a sixth has already been “normalized” in his thinking to a paradigmatic descending fifth, without any mention of the extraordinary heightening of dissonance that “sums up” the drama just prior to the descending sixth’s chromatically-harmonized descent and ultimate resolution to F.",

Schenker ( 1954 , 252) claimed that the Prelude begins in G major (with an auxiliary cadence in which E minor is vi of G). Leonard B. Meyer ( 1956 , 93–97) concurs, analyzing the Prelude in terms of three varied sequential phases (in G major, D major, and A minor), illustrating a process whose dissonant harmonic distortion in the second phase illustrates “the importance of doubt and uncertainty in the shaping of aesthetic affective experience” ( 96 ). Lawrence Kramer ( 1990 , 84–85) goes further, in his more hermeneutic analysis, to interpret “the structure of concentrated anticipation at the core of the A-minor Prelude” as “refashion[ing] the tonic of the Classical style in the image of desire.” He considers the Prelude as a whole as an example of an “impossible object” (just as the tonic is here an impossible object of desire) in that the Prelude’s excessive deformity, strangeness, and resulting fascination for the listener serve to position it among a group of similar cultural products in art and literature. Although my own interpretation is rather different, I share with Kramer a concern for the “interiority of the Romantic subject” ( 97 ) that the Prelude’s expressive character and deferred tonal processes imply.",

When Chopin or Schumann simulate—or dissimulate—a series of potential closures before the actual end of a work, how might a performer project the expressive significance of these pre-closures as feints, or parts of a larger dramatic trajectory? In effect, how might a performer lead a listener to experience the appropriate significance of each presumed closure in a dramatically satisfying way? I begin with a comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the variety of musical elements and strategies that contribute to expressive meaning, to help explain expressive dramas of closure that go beyond tonal resolution. In reaching a more complete understanding of the expressive and dramatic issues involved, I briefly consider aspects of performance practice, as well as clues from the autograph and subsequent editions of the work. By offering my own performance of the Chopin and Schumann examples, I illustrate some of the pianistic options that can contribute to a coherent expressive interpretation of these two closural dramas.",

                "text": "[2] To situate my interpretive stance, I offer the following definitions of tonal and expressive closure. Tonal closure in Western art music is defined primarily by the return and cadential confirmation of the tonic. For the later Schenker, this includes completion of the Urlinie (the fundamental stepwise descent to tonic in the structural upper voice) in tandem with completion of the Ursatz (the structural I–V–I progression underlying a work). Although Schenker’s reductive tonal analyses may also imply a tonal drama of thematized pitch conflict, my approach to expressive closure considers the contribution of still other thematized elements, such as rhythm, dynamics, articulation, pacing, texture, gestures, topics, tropes, and even formal genres and styles (see Hatten 1994 and 2004 ). The unique strategies required to solve problems of dramatic resolution (or to “sum up” the conflict, in cases where resolution is not possible) often necessitate more music beyond the point of Ursatz completion. Indeed, the unusual strategies required to achieve thematic closure may elude a reductionist’s attempt to hear the musical “surface” solely in terms of diminutions elaborating an underlying tonal paradigm. To introduce this broader concept of expressive closure, I begin with a brief example of thematic closure in Beethoven, a case in which intensification of dramatic conflict after the point of tonal closure leads to a more emphatic, but ultimately tragic outcome.

                "text": "[3] Beethoven’s codas often dramatize expressive closure by foregrounding a fundamental premise of conflict that underlies the sonata-form movement, just before its definitive resolution. This may lead, paradoxically, to the greatest dissonances heard thus far; their ultimate resolution is correspondingly more forceful. The first movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in F minor, op. 2, no. 1, achieves its dramatically expressive closure in a coda of a scant few bars ( Example 1 ), not only by summing up the rhythmic dissonance premised by the movement, but also by destabilizing the potential structural descent itself. What Schenker ( 2004 ) graphs as part of the early Urlinie for this movement is the structural upper-line descent from 5 ˆ to 1 ˆ (C– B ♭ – A ♭ –G–F). But the reprise of that descent in the coda is dissonantly harmonized with applied dominants and diatonic seventh chords, and what is foregrounded is actually the fully thematized descent from C to E-natural. First presented (as unresolved) in the opening theme (measures 7–8), the descent is also used at a deeper level to structure the development section’s retransitional drive to the dominant, and it returns to the foreground in the brief coda, resolving to tonic only in the last measure of the movement. (2) Thus, strategies of thematic closure prolong tonal closure and justify the extension created by a highly charged coda. Expressively, the tragic trajectory of this movement finds tonal closure, but since the final cadential descent has been undermined by heightened rhythmic and pitch dissonance, the ultimate tonal closure may be interpreted as reinforcing the tragic expressive trajectory of the movement, as if a horrific Fate were inexorably approaching and capturing the protagonist in its ultimate, emphatic gesture of closure (like a stone door slamming shut on a tomb).

Furthermore, a series of potential expressive closures may interact in interesting ways to create a larger closural drama. Chopin’s expressive premise for his Prelude in A minor, op. 28, no. 2, is tragic, and his ultimate closure enhances the finality of that tragedy, as was the case in the Beethoven example. But there are striking differences; Chopin implements of a series of expressive closures to create a more complex drama with conflicting goals. To understand this dramatic trajectory, consider first the initial expressive premise of the Prelude, which is more specifically funereal in its tragic character than the Beethoven example, as may be seen from the autograph of Chopin’s fair copy for the French edition ( Example 2 ).

Appropriately, the melodic gesture entering in measure 3 has a heavy lament character, with the move to subtonic 7 ˆ providing a more primitive sound in accord with the primitive wheels of the ox cart. The three-note motive (E–B–D) may also suggest a bardic or narrative voice; the same intervallic idea is used to announce the opening waltz of Chopin’s Ballade in G minor, op. 23. (6) Example 3 .

The bitterness of grief is foregrounded here by a crescendo above the most dissonant harmonic formation thus far, in measure 11. This expressive crisis avoids closure by a legato enjambment of the accompaniment into the third phrase, beginning in measure 13. The overlap is also intensified by dissonant energy, enhancing the obsessive and inexorably tragic character of the accompaniment. The accumulated intensity gradually yields under a long diminuendo, from measure 13 to 18, anticipated by the painful reversal from C ♯ to C-natural in the left hand in measure 12. If that chromatic reversal suggests frustrated resignation, the gradual diminuendo may further the sense of yielding to sullen grief. Another reversal in measure 14 pulls F ♯ down to F-natural in the bass, and the resulting augmented-sixth chord (F–A–B– D ♯ ) pulls the third phrase along to its ultimate tonal goal via a cadential in A minor (downbeat of measure 15). But the third phrase goes awry amid a more enigmatic statement of the opening lament motive: in measure 16, an anguished lowered- 6 ˆ (F-natural) substitutes for the lament-oriented lowered- 7 ˆ (G). The dissonant stab of F-natural (marked by the crescendo wedge) produces enough friction to grind the cart wheels to a halt in mid-phrase. An a cappella continuation of the lament melody leads to a point of no return in measure 18. Here, memory of the wheel-turning ostinato blurs into metaphorical distance, a specific effect achieved by strict observance of Chopin’s only pedal indication. This dissonant stoppage creates what I call a negative cadence, an initial expressive closure that is marked by dissonance (instead of resolution) and in this case, dissolution (not merely liquidation). (8) There follows an abrupt and deathly silence—an acoustical absence that suggests a moment of recognition: perhaps of existential horror (“Is this death?”). The music picks up with a tentative sequence of the lament’s continuation phrase, gradually winding down in tempo as the upper line slumps from D to B in measures 20–21. The gap between 4 ˆ and 2 ˆ , (D and B), where we might have expected an inexorable linear descent, is also a marked expressive feature of Prelude no. 4 in E minor. In both preludes, the apparent gap in a structural linear descent may be associated with absence, and hence loss.",

This surprising change of texture has a closural effect, and the progression of major triads is appropriately and definitively positive. Even as the new texture shifts out of the prevailing discourse, as if to comment on it, the B-major triad’s dominant function projects a Picardy-third effect onto the E-major triad as potential tonic in measure 22 (despite its own dominant function in the larger scheme). This closural effect supports an initial interpretation of the trajectory as leading to spiritual acceptance—a positive resignation that, given the religioso cues, may even suggest spiritual abnegation. (9) This interpretation of expressive closure is enhanced by the root-to-root cadential implication of B to E (an unusually strong “embellishment” of V this late in the piece) as well as the written-out ritard to a half-note duration in measure 22. (10) The suggestion of an expressive genre that takes us from grief to consolation was foreshadowed when the funeral-march dotted rhythm in measure 6 moved to G major. (11) Note that the last occurrence of the funereal rhythm in measure 21 is clear of any ambiguous modal mixture; the repeated notes are instead heard in the context of a religioso closural suspension (an implied 4–3 above E) in major. If the work had ended after the E major triad in measure 22, we might have interpreted the dramatic trajectory as extreme grief ameliorated by religious consolation and acceptance. Example 5 .

Many performers use pedaling to promote the sustaining of these long notes, which obscures what I consider to be a very important interpretive element: the raw, creaking sound of the oxcart’s wheels grinding dissonantly and intermittently. The inner-voice “Dies irae” line also reveals itself more clearly if the accompaniment is not swimming in pedal. And finally, the special blurred-pedal effect in measures 18–19 would lose its marked, distinctive character and potential expressive meaning here, if used earlier. Audio Example 1 .

In order for the obsessively turning wheels to sound inexorably tragic, I also avoid the extreme phrase-internal tempo fluctuations used by some pianists to accommodate the expressive placement of the melodic pitches (especially in measures 4 and 9). The crescendo in measure 11 helps to intensify the harmonic dissonance to a point of unbearable tension. Chopin in the fair copy autograph (Example 2) scratched out the crescendo and redrew it as applicable to the right hand alone. The French first edition omits any crescendo here, whereas the German first edition begins the crescendo on beat two and the English first edition begins it on beat one. The Polish Complete Works edition (Example 4) reproduces the crescendo more generously, beginning from E at the end of measure 10 and going through the first three F ♯ s in the melody. Enhancing the dissonant intensification through a slight accelerando makes sense to me, both for the crescendo here and the smaller one leading to measure 16, which in turn emphasizes the abrupt silencing of the accompaniment in measure 17. The subsequent slentando (literally, “becoming slower”) is an unusual marking where one might have expected morendo or smorzando , although when combined with the ongoing dim ., the effect is presumably the same. (16) The effect of dying away is enhanced by the pedaled recall of the ostinato; its Dies irae incipit, in correct intervallic and scale-degree transposition for the first time, adds a haunting spectre of doom to the tragic dissolution.",

I further interpret the sostenuto as implying a greater fullness of sound and a marked (broadened) emphasis on these pseudo-final chords. (17) In addition, I use special voicing for the G ♯ in measure 22, to emphasize its illusory Picardy-third character.

The drama differs from the Chopin in that the tragic is not only reversed, but the reversal holds, since a transcendently positive outcome is ultimately achieved. A quick overview of Schumann’s idiosyncratic tonal strategy for the entire set will establish the formal context for Schumann’s expressive closural strategies (see Figure 1 ). (19) Beginning with the oscillating tonic complex of G major/E minor for the first dance, Schumann moves to B minor for the second, and ends the first half with C major for no. 9. But it is the poetic second dance in B minor (“signed” after the double bar with “E.” for Eusebius) that Schumann chooses for his cyclic return, as a poignant memory arising in the middle of no. 17. B minor as closural tonic is foreshadowed already in the trio of no. 16, which begins on V of B minor and functions as a tempo transition and tonal introduction to no. 17 in B major. The expressive indication at the head of no. 17, “Wie aus der Ferne,” implies not only spatial but temporal distance, and hence reminiscence.

The tension of the repeated melodic gesture, 3 ˆ – 2 ˆ , and the saturation of accents on every beat, together build to the effect of an “overflowing” release into the cadence at measure 33. Note that the 4–3 suspension in the alto (C above the dominant, G, in the bass), stuck in measures 16–18, resolves (an octave higher) only on the last beat of measure 32, and the weight of this long-delayed confirmation of C is further enhanced by a plagal cadential echo, which is launched sf at the end of measure 33. Ultimately, the cadential expansion overflows into an even more celebratory epiphany. (23)",

Ironically, Schumann’s most obvious programmatic element in the final waltz, the tolling of the midnight hour, is not actually referenced in the novel that helped inspire the set. The twelve strokes of midnight, a traditional signal for the close of a ball, sound on low C in the bass in measures 41 and 43–53; the Cs in the melody reiterate these twelve strokes canonically from measure 49 to the end. Each set of bells is launched by the respective voice’s arrival at tonic closure, suggesting an echoing reverberation as part of the gradual, closural dissolution.",

The formal and expressive “overflow” of the waltz’s own form is achieved through an extraordinary transformation from hesitancy to bright conviction. This surprising epiphany fully reverses the previously final, tragic coda of no. 17, providing an expressive closure more suited to the mixed emotional terrain of the cycle. Audio Example 2 . Schumann, Davidsbündertänze op. 6, nos. 17–18. Performance by the author See Example 6 . The recorded excerpt begins halfway through no. 17, with the repeat of the middle section (in B major) of the quoted Ländler from no. 2; it continues ( attacca , after the long decay of the final chord of no. 17) through to the end of no. 18",

                "text": "[27] In my performance ( Audio Example 2 ), I interpret the “Nicht schnell” tempo marking of no. 18 as properly cautionary, not just for the magical transition’s necessary rubato , but for the hesitancy of the waltz proper. (24) Since that hesitancy is best conveyed through articulation and internal rubato , I attempt to keep the pacing of measures rather steady. The harmonic urgency of the B section is reflected in a slight accelerando , so that the marked ritard will regain the original tempo for the return of the introductory chord and A′ section of the waltz. At the moment of formal overflow, marked in measure 26 by a subito mf , I project the sense of a sudden insight through nuanced timing and dynamics. I allow the repeated gesture and accentual saturation to affect my tempo, as I gradually accelerate with emotional excitement, responding to an impending sense of epiphany. But I only touch the pedal on the downbeats for the first wave of this epiphany, maintaining articulatory separation between the bass and the accented octaves or chords in the left hand. When the varied expansion in measure 35 “frees” the right hand from its insistence on 2 ˆ , I accelerate even further to convey a more free-wheeling and rollicking experience of ecstatic joy, now more fully pedaling each measure to create a blur of excitement. My larger arm gestures enhance the depth of sound, ideally without overdoing the dynamics; visually, these arm gestures serve to support the windmilling effect of the cadential expansion. The accented repeating Ds in the tenor foreshadow the tolling Cs at the end (the Ds appear in two sets of six, in measures 27–32 and 35–40); thus, they may also be brought out for their programmatic significance. The third beat of each of these measures receives emphasis due to the initiation of the slurred figure, which is also emphasized by Schumann’s hairpins. In anticipation, I slightly exaggerate the cross-accentuation, derived from the opening of the waltz in measure 3, as an internal rubato against the steady measure-pulse. The metrically dissonant interpretive layer ( Krebs 1999 ) resolves at the cadence in measure 33 and is then “reset” by the marked sf of the plagal echo in measures 33–34.",

The alto is answered and in effect displaced by the soprano line at the end of measure 43. The leading melodic line then shifts at the cadence in measure 49 to the tenor and ultimately to the bass at the end of measure 53. During this progressive dissolution of the thematic texture, I begin a decrescendo earlier than marked in the score, and I also anticipate the ritard marked for the final melodic echo in the bass. A more subtle rubato in measures 41–42 attends my performance of this “afterglow” plagal response to the bass cadence. When the alto melody takes over at that cadence, there is an effect of going over the top of a wave, rather than a closural stoppage. Such effects may be found in Bach and Mozart, where closure elides with plagal extension, but never with quite this sense of melodic overflow—and my interpretation of a continually affirming epiphany serves to guide my rubato as I spin over this point of closure.",

                "text": "[29] To summarize, Chopin and Schumann, just like Beethoven and others before, found ingenious means not merely to prolong closure, but to do so in a way that enhances the expressive trajectory of a work (whether a prelude, a waltz, or an entire cycle). The rhetorical play with tonal and formal closure suggests that harmony and voice-leading are not the sole determinants of closure, but that they can be manipulated to serve more complex expressive ends. With this knowledge, a performer may more effectively participate in a dramatic play of closures—emphasizing an illusory cadence only to shift dramatically to the actual cadence, as in the Chopin, or emphasizing a definitive cadence only to shift dramatically to another entire waltz that in turn overflows its formal scheme, as in the Schumann. The potential for these shifts to create new levels of discourse may in turn support Romantic irony, in which a narrative agency comments on the discourse. Or they may move inward to support a deeper expressive effect of dramatic recognition or epiphany on the part of a central protagonist. Either way, expressive considerations motivate the play of closures: an illusory cadence may create a strong sense of expressive closure by miming a structural function it does not literally possess, as in the Chopin, or strong structural and expressive closure may be overturned to create the effect of emotional overflow leading to epiphany, as in the Schumann.",

But however one performs the ambiguities and reversals of multiple expressive closures, I would recommend working toward spontaneity . For it is only a hard-won spontaneity that can re-enact the flow of consciousness, and reflect the more fragile coherence of a complex human subjectivity in these works. Whether existential, as in the Chopin, or transcendent, as in the Schumann, expressive closures move beyond conventional tonal and formal closures in order to convey the more subtle psychological and spiritual dramas of the human condition.",
