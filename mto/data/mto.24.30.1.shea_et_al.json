It is not clear why certain songs appear on Billboard ’s “Hot Rap Songs” chart while others appear on “Hot Hip-Hop/R&B,” but the labels themselves are problematic. For example, “Hotline Bling” (Drake, 2015), a song that includes no rapping whatsoever, spent 18 weeks at number 1 on the “Hot Rap Songs” chart and received the 2017 Grammy for Best Rap Song. The first (and to date only) song to outlast “Hotline Bling” at number one on this chart, “Old Town Road” (Lil’ Nas X ft. Billy Ray Cyrus, 2019), also has no rapping.

Throughout this paper, we have acknowledged the ambiguity between the concepts of “style” and “genre.” Allan Moore ( 2001 ) is one of several scholars who propose a distinction between style and genre that aims to clarify divergent uses of the latter term. For Moore, style refers to the manner of articulation of musical gestures, while genre refers to the identity and context of those gestures. Moore’s distinction is predicated on orientation: style is hierarchical, but genre is not. To illustrate, we might compare two genres discussed in this paper: country and metal. At a very general level, some common stylistic attributes of these genres emerge. Both involve the regular use of guitar, bass, and drums, for example. Even the musical roles of some of these instruments remain constant: drummer as primary timekeeper, bass as foundation to guitar-based harmonic material. But on a more specific level, divergences appear. In metal, the guitar sound is often distorted, which is rare in country, and the harmonic languages are different. Reflecting the hierarchical nature of these aspects of style, while the drummer-as-timekeeper aspect holds constant, the meters in which the drummer commonly plays might not, nor the types of drums and cymbals normally used. Because genre involves more than just musical characteristics, treating them hierarchically makes little sense. Instead, the generic commonalities between metal and country, for example, could be shown in a Venn diagram, where overlapping generic conventions exist side-by-side with characteristics unique to each genre (but that might overlap with yet another genre). In an empirical study of popular music focusing on strictly musical parameters, as long as these are understood as only one dimension of genre, the terminology used to encompass them—style, structure, “formal rules” (after Fabbri 2004 [1982] )—is less important.",

The Avant-garde phase describes the beginnings of a genre, before its codes of behavior are fully cemented or any true, positive exemplar of the genre emerges. Scene-based genres exist on a localized level, with increasingly solid codes of production and behavior as well as a concentrated locus of orientation.

Traditional approaches to music corpus development typically involve compiling features from a repertoire defined by geographic region, historical period, and/or a socially determined category of musical style. Often these parameters intersect and are an explicit component of their constituency; e.g., harmonic annotations of 18th-century Western European art-music works ( Devaney et al. 2015 ) or contemporary North American popular-music songs ( Burgoyne 2012 ). There are also numerous strategies for building a corpus, depending on the aims of the researcher. Corpora of convenience are perhaps the most common, drawing upon an existing resource created by someone other than the researcher to capture a repertoire. This is especially true of popular-music corpus studies, which typically rely on measurements of popularity, levels of cultural salience, or approximations of a musical “mainstream” within some genre ( London 2013 ). These operationalizations can include commercial success ( Burgoyne 2012 ), historical fame ( Devaney et al. 2015 , Ohriner 2016 ), or the emergent consensus of a user-driven forum ( White and Quinn 2016 , Shea 2020 ).",

We argue that social forces should be carefully considered and, quite often, actively combatted when sampling for corpus studies, in order to avoid perpetuating real-world biases against already-marginalized populations. Previous research has considered the effects of discriminatory forces inherent in commercial music practices (e.g., Epps-Darling, Bouyer, and Cramer 2020 ; Neal 2016 ; Rose 1994 ; Smith et al. 2020 ; Watson 2019a ) and has shown that creating corpora from only convenience samples may replicate the racism, sexism, xenophobia, and other forms of exclusion inherent in their source materials. For example, if the people who determine what is popular or famous in a given genre employ sexist preferences when creating a corpus of that genre, their corpus will reflect that sexism, whether or not such biases are conscious. Once a musical corpus is developed, it tends to be used consistently in other research due to its convenience; see, for example, the McGill Billboard and Rolling Stone 200 corpora. (1) We argue that researchers should consider social forces when constructing new corpora. By not considering such forces, researchers run the risk of perpetuating harm to marginalized populations through ongoing studies grounded in inequitable corpora. Example 1 .

The ADAS acts on a parent corpus —an initial corpus, list, or dataset— and applies an intentional sampling method to counterbalance discriminatory forces that may have affected the parent corpus’s constituency. The resulting child corpus includes more diverse artist identities and also may better represent the musical diversity within some style or genre. (3) This process is outlined in Example 1 . We will demonstrate the application of these sampling methods to a novel corpus of popular music, Timbre in Popular Song ( TiPS ). This new corpus, which we initially constructed in order to study timbre and texture, comprises four contrasting popular genres: country, pop, metal, and hip hop. We share our process constructing the TiPS corpus in order to show how the ADAS can inform sampling: for each genre, we apply the ADAS to a parent corpus to produce four child corpora. While we focus primarily on popular music in this essay, the technologies and criticisms we develop can generalize to any corpus-oriented research program. Most relevant to our discussion of social forces, the ADAS takes advantage of the natural ambiguity and flexibility of genre to steer corpus creation towards greater representation. We posit that if musical genres emerge as fluid categories based on cultural preferences, these preferences may be influenced by racist, misogynist, xenophobic, and other discriminatory stances. An anti-discriminatory corpus can work to minimize the effects of such stances, providing a better musical understanding of the internal characteristics of a genre by including the musical practices of a wider variety of humans who have contributed to it.",

For instance, the rock songs in Biamonte ( 2010 ) and the French and German art songs in VanHandel & Song ( 2010 ) do reflect the authors’ efforts to foreground contributions by female artists but simultaneously do not address racial or ethnic diversity. The same could be said of the Yale Classical Archives Corpus as featured in White ( 2013 ) and subsequent related publications. Duinker ( 2020 ) likewise acknowledges the gender imbalance that results from passively using external sources for corpus development but stops short of modifying the corpus to rectify this. A similar but slightly different issue arises in work by Shea ( 2020 ; 2023 ) which utilizes a preliminary model of our proposed demographic sampling procedure. However, these studies do so imprecisely by treating BIPOC and Black as analogous identities. By recognizing these methodological shortcomings and our relative position of privilege within our field, we hope to encourage others to avoid “white complicity” ( Applebaum 2008 ) by adopting a proactive attitude toward anti-discriminatory practices in the nascent subfield of corpus studies.",

Section 2 provides a broad overview of the role that social forces play—and issues that they introduce—in corpus construction. After a brief discussion of terminology in Section 3, Section 4 analyzes Rolling Stone Magazine’s list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,” using its underlying demographics to demonstrate the connection between discriminatory social forces and those songs acclaimed as paragons of a musical genre. Section 5 then focuses on the McGill Billboard corpus, a frequently used dataset derived from that publication’s “Hot 100” song charts. Here, we capitalize on the relatively greater diversity of artists in this list to examine the relationship among demographics, musical consistency, and genre. We find that demographics are deeply intertwined with musical consistency, to the extent that demographic exclusivity will ignore the musical variations present in a given historical tradition. Section 6 then operationalizes the ADAS, with Section 7 offering an example of results of this process in corpora from four different genres. Section 8 undertakes an analysis of these various corpora, showing how the actions of the ADAS allow for particular identity-connected stylistic rivulets to be identifiable, here showing the connection between the use of a prechorus and gender throughout various genres. Finally, Section 9 concludes the article by returning to the notion of genre, arguing that the boundaries and constituency of this concept are flexible enough to accommodate the ADAS approach. This flexibility empowers corpus analysts to sample widely from a generic repertoire; such a selection enhances artist diversity and can better capture the musical practices within that genre. We offer the ADAS as a potential framework for any music researcher who is interested in employing the anti-discriminatory sampling strategies outlined herein. 1.

The problem, however, runs deeper than this solution’s capacity: the ways that musicians, producers, distributors, and consumers have grouped and divided music—especially 20th-century American popular music—are inextricably tied to personal identities and the history of their discrimination and exclusion. In what follows, we outline some issues surrounding categorizing songs and artists into musical genres. We also touch upon historical discriminatory perspectives that have shaped modern music scholarship and education, especially in music theory. We argue that such discriminatory forces run sufficiently deep within these areas that a more radical reorientation of corpus methods is required for an anti-discriminatory approach.

                "text": "[1.2] In Categorizing Sound: Genre and Twentieth-Century Popular Music , David Brackett observes that “genres are not static groupings of empirically verifiable musical characteristics, but rather associations of texts whose criteria of similarity may vary according to the uses to which the genre labels are put. ‘Similar’ elements include more than musical features, and groupings often hinge on elements of nation, class, race, gender, sexuality, and so on” ( 2016 , 3–4). As we began to describe earlier, the history of 20th-century popular genres in the United States is a study in discrimination, segregation, and exclusion. Beginning in the 1920s, the genre categories of “race music” and “hillbilly” were predicated on the racial identities of recording artists and their intended public. Despite musical similarities and common influences, rural musics by white artists and by artists of color were marketed separately, as “hillbilly” music for white audiences and “race” music for black audiences. Such a division was supported by segregationist laws passed by many states in the southern US in the late nineteenth century ( Miller 2010 , 2–3). In many contexts, race has underscored a barrier between specific genres and the so-called musical mainstream. The list of Afro-diasporic genres that have been subsumed into mainstream popular music is long, including blues, jazz, R&B, rock ’n’ roll, soul, funk, disco, and hip-hop. Johnson ( 2018 ) notes the exclusionary effect that the development of rock’n’roll had on Black musicians whose music gave rise to the genre in the first place. Rock’n’roll musicians were mainly white and marketed to a mainstream white audience, while Black musicians, whose output was more typically categorized as R&B, were largely denied the level of market access enjoyed by their white peers in the 1950s.",

(4) This shifting nomenclature is emblematic of the record industry’s perennial sidelining of Black artists, first as a means of overt segregation under the Race and R&B demonyms, and more recently as a catchall bin grouping artists and songs that have very little in common stylistically under the “Hot Black Singles” banner.

A comprehensive summary is well beyond this study, but writings by historical music theorists offer a straightforward example of this problematic trend. Archival work conducted by Anna Gawboy ( 2016 ) reveals how François-Joseph Fétis, a primary contributor to modern conceptions of tonality, upheld white Western European art music as superior to that of other cultures. Fétis specifically refers to harmony as a distinguishing musical feature when he writes “ . . . the black and yellow races, have demonstrated their incapacity to reach that formation of music as a true and complete art . . . The true history of music only begins with the general history of that privileged [white] race, which never knew a savage state” ( 1867 , 108). (7) Schenker’s theories offer analogous attitudes about racial inequality and pitch supremacy, as criticized by Ewell ( 2020 , [4.5.2]). Such beliefs were foundational in early music education, especially regarding aptitude assessments. Fétis, as director of the Royal Conservatory at Brussels, maintained that “the aptitude for the conception of the relations of sounds is due to . . . the organs of intelligence in the different races” ( 1867 ). This eugenicist perspective is borne out in the work of Carl Seashore. Devaney ( 2019 ) details how Seashore’s belief in eugenics informed his reliance on pitch discrimination tasks in his battery of “objective” musical discrimination tests, which were specifically designed to make generalizations about musical ability in non-white populations.",

Our approach engages these issues in two ways: directly, through intentional and systematic artist sampling, and indirectly, by foregrounding texture and timbre as musical features that are potentially more inclusive of broader musical experiences and genres. By raising these issues, we are not accusing any individual corpus analysts of discrimination, racism, or misogyny. Our project is simply to raise awareness around particular latent issues in music-data analysis, and to suggest some ways to address these issues. 2.

Prototypical “rock” music, particularly that from the 1960s and ’70s, has long been purported as the most “authentic” of all popular-music genres ( Negus and Astor 2022 ). Sanneh ( 2004 ) describes this overt bias as rockism, or the widely held conception in scholarship and music criticism that music in the rock genre is more “authentic” and aesthetically superior to music in other popular genres. This construction of authenticity is often tied up in biases in favor of male gender identities ( Auslander 2004 , Reddington 2012 ). For example, a masculine “authentic” notion of rock is often contrasted with a more feminine “pop” ( Coates 1997 , Davies 2001 ). Furthermore, as Walser ( 1993 ) and Waksman ( 1999 ) note, ideals of virtuosic performance—especially on the guitar—were tied to expressions of hypermasculinity in mid-century popular music. (13) It is not surprising, then, that a list framed as the “Greatest Songs of All Time” would show a bias toward male representation in the mid-20th century. Considering the cultural capital associated with mid-century rock’s constructs of authenticity, it is also unsurprising that these lists overrepresent songs from the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s. These forces combine to magnify sexism (with definitions of rock tied to masculinity) and prioritize rock’s ostensible authenticity in these lists. Lending new urgency to these concerns is the sexist and racist rhetoric of Rolling Stone Magazine co-founder Jann Wenner who recently defended his belief that only white men are rock’s “masters” ( Marchese 2023 ).

As various commentators have noted ( Redd 1985 , Russell 1970 , Stoia 2013 ), the mainstream of rock was initially distinguished from genres like rhythm and blues on racial grounds, with the former made by and for white people and the latter for and by Black people, regardless of the largely shared musical characteristics of the two genres. Notions of an “authentic” and “classic” rock mainstream are thus tied to the racial segregation of the genre’s origins. Importantly, Smith et al. ( 2020 ) have noted that the sexism and racism apparent in mid-century American music seems to have decreased in recent decades, as Black and female musicians have garnered increasing levels of mainstream commercial success. From this perspective, the difference in ethnic and racial distributions between pre-2000 and post-2000 songs can be traced to the particular exclusionary tactics inherent in rock’s founding and more broadly in the 20th-century music industry.

Each song and artist is associated with a series of binary variables corresponding to each category: if an ensemble includes at least one nonmale member, for instance, the nonmale variable is set to 1, while in an all-male band that variable would be 0. (15) A similar procedure occurs for BIHAP artists. (16) The model also implements a primary status variable that considers artists’ agency within their ensemble: if either the title/lead member of the group or half or more of the group’s members are of historically marginalized backgrounds by race/ethnicity and/or gender the song receives this status. Example 2 offers a sample case of artist encoding for top-ranking songs in 2004 and 2021. Importantly, our approach to marginalization is based on larger demographics and histories of the United States via census data, (17) rather than the specific dynamics within some musical community or genre: non-white singers are considered minoritized because they make up a minority of the US population and because of the historical racism associated with that identity. Furthermore, our approach is simply one way of capturing demographic data, and we do not argue that it is the only way one might undertake such representation, nor that this method is without flaws and shortcomings.

If roughly half (50%) the population is female, then the expected number of female artists should be about 50%. The fact that only 15.6% and 28.2% of the RS2004 and RS2021 lists are nonmale dramatically deviates from this expectation. However, compared to these baselines, both Rolling Stone lists have more BIHAP artists than one might expect, with 48% and 51% of the lists’ constituent groups including at least one BIHAP member, but only 24% of the population identifying as BIHAP on the census during this time period.

The exceptions occur in the post-1995 portions of RS2021 : here, songs by nonmale artists and groups make up roughly half of the entries in these half-decades, more closely approximating population statistics. Notably, however, these half-decades are among the most sparsely populated with songs in the corpus. Far from being uniformly distributed, the lists most heavily represent the period between 1965–1980. Additionally, in terms of artist demographics, the highest proportional representation of all-white groups is in the 1970s, and the highest representation of all-male groups is between 1965–1980. These higher representations couple with the spikes in song counts to magnify the proportions found within this time span. We will return to the effects of this magnification below. Example 5 .

Similarly, a corpus using the Billboard charts is based on commercial success, another human-facing determination. In each instance the musical grouping purportedly being represented by the corpus is defined by some human activity.

These concerns can be directly connected back to notions of musical genre and identity: if musical expression is connected with identity—if artists from different backgrounds and social situations make music differently and rely on different musical norms—then expanding the social contexts that define a corpus might compromise an analyst’s ability to identify consistencies and norms within that dataset. Following this devil’s advocacy to its logical conclusion: if “rock” as a genre was mostly the property of white men in mid-century Anglo-America, then a “rock corpus” that expands its song selection outside of these demographics may be introducing music that sounds and behaves differently than music by mid-century white male rockers. In other words, it is possible that culturally diverse corpora run the risk of stylistic incoherence—of overcorrecting for London’s overfitting to the point of “underfitting” some musical tradition.

If the events of that song do not align with the expectations of the corpus statistics, the cross entropy will be high. In other words, if a song uses the same chords, chord roots, and formal zones as the overall corpus, the song will have a low cross entropy along these domains, and can be thought of as conforming to the mainstream practice of the corpus. Cross entropy calculates the probability that some event occurs in a corpus (for instance, how often a IV chord occurs in a corpus compared to all other chords that occur in that corpus) and uses that probability to assess the events in some individual song (for instance, the corpus’s IV-chord probability would be applied to all the IV chords in the song being analyzed). The equation below shows how the values associated with the larger corpus and the individual piece are combined together. Following the norms of information theory ( White 2022 ), the broader corpus’s probability q of some event x is converted to a logarithm log ( q ( x )), and is combined with how often that event x occurs in the individual song ( p ( x )). Also, following convention, we report these values using a base-2 logarithm. Because major-mode statistics would generally not predict the events of minor-mode songs and vice versa, we only used major-mode pieces in calculating chord and chord-root distributions.

The example also shows the relative proportions of songs with each usage type by the size of the pie charts.

Furthermore, these differences may show influences from African diasporic music, and potentially illustrate how Black performers were positioned in popular music during the era covered by these Billboard charts. A corpus featuring only the most mainstream artists might miss these interwoven narratives of experimentation, stylistic borrowing, and musical development. 5.

We illustrate our method by applying the ADAS to the Timbre in Popular Song ( TiPS ) corpus, which includes sub-corpora of songs from four popular genres in the decade 1990–1999: country, metal, hip-hop, and pop. (30) While we introduce the ADAS as a general approach to corpus construction that could be applied in any number of ways to any number of musical traditions, our specific implementation described here focuses on these four popular genres. Below, we review the sociocultural issues surrounding each genre, analyze the demographic statistics, and outline how the ADAS’s process acts on each genre-specific corpus.",

Our child corpora are based on parent corpora of 150–225 songs drawn primarily from Billboard lists, which rank songs from particular genres within particular chronological windows by commercial success.

Echoing our earlier analyses, songs were encoded with five binary variables: nonmale , non-cis , race , ethnicity , and primary . Each variable was encoded as zero if no members of the band were from the corresponding population. Again, as we described above, we combined race and ethnicity into a sixth race/ethnicity variable. (32) The “primary” variable was once again used to indicate whether the founding, forward-facing member(s), or majority of the band was of a marginalized identity (our definition of marginalized in this category comes from Smith et al. 2018 ). Example 8 demonstrates this type of encoding. (Note that all four ensemble members in Heavy D & the Boyz are Black, Shania Twain is the title artist and is female, and the Spice Girls are an all-female group with one Black member, Mel B, so their “primary” variables are encoded as 1.)",

Our current study aimed to make our corpora more representative of the overall population of the United States during the chronological window represented by the corpus. We also opted to make this a relative rather than absolute goal: the minimum acceptable proportion for representation in each genre’s child corpus was established based on the diversity within its parent corpus, with more initial diversity resulting in higher targets than corpora with less initial diversity. We therefore set target proportions for gender and for race/ethnicity by calculating the geometric mean—an averaging function designed for proportions—between the proportion in the parent corpus and the relevant US Census data for that time period.

Given a sufficiently large parent corpus, a child corpus may be able to simply retain songs by marginalized artists so that the resulting dataset meets or exceeds the demographic benchmarks. If this is not the case, additional songs can be drawn from datasets adjacent to the parent corpus in order to adjust the child corpus’s population demographics. The origin of such adjacent datasets necessarily varies depending on the types of pre-existing lists available that are relevant to any given child corpus, but strategies might include selecting songs from alternatively curated lists, exploring genre-based lists designed to highlight marginalized identities, or drawing from lists that are closely related to the parent corpus. Examples of such strategies are described in further detail below with respect to specific genres in the TiPS corpus, but these do not represent the only options for identifying additional songs. Ultimately, the choice must be unique to each parent corpus; the researcher should be intentional in this matter, remaining mindful of the integrity of the corpus, and ensuring that the resulting research is transparent about the source(s) of the additional songs. Once songs from marginalized artists reach the targeted proportions, songs from non-marginalized artists are chosen from the parent corpus to fill in the remainder of the child corpus.

The trope of hypermasculinization, especially in 1990s hip-hop, created commercial incentive for MCs to play up their masculinity, which further marginalized the contributions of women MCs ( Rose 1994 ). Finally, the rap-sung collaborations that have come to dominate mainstream pop music typically involve male rappers and female singers, further entrenching these roles in mainstream hip-hop music ( 2021 , 180; Duguay 2022 ; Duinker 2021 ).",

The racial qualifier “white” frequently appears in descriptions of country music in industry publications from its formative years ( Hammond 2011 , 15–16). Mather also documents the exclusion of non-white contributions to country music—“Most [historical] surveys define country as a commercialized entertainment whose primary characteristics have been inherited from the British Isles” ( 2017 , 331)—despite its incorporation of elements drawn from black musical traditions, such as the use of the banjo ( Dubois 2016 ) and 12-bar blues forms, as well as aspects of other musics such as Hawaiian slide guitar, yodeling, and the use of Latin American influences, especially from Mexico, on western swing ( Cusic 1999 ).",

Only when a remix version featuring vocals by Billy Ray Cyrus—a remix which retained the original track and many of Lil Nas X’s original vocals—did “Old Town Road” again earn a place on the Hot Country Songs list. The irony of these events can be seen in the incorporation of rap and other hip-hop influences in the music of successful country groups like white artists Florida Georgia Line, who are generally understood as representative of the country genre today.

We retained these songs in the child corpus. Given the paucity of non-white artists in the parent corpus, we also added 11 more songs by non-white artists. To identify supplemental songs for the country child corpus, we began by demographically surveying the top 25 Billboard country songs for each relevant year, plus several “best of” country lists found online. However, these methods did not suggest any new songs by nonwhite artists. Consequently, we then searched “country artists” combined with keywords including “Black,” “Indigenous,” “of color,” and “diverse” to identify 11 songs to add to the corpus. Of the 14 songs by artists of color in the country child corpus, seven songs charted in the top 20 on weekly charts; the other seven were lower-ranked, but mostly within the top 50 and all within the top 100. While one of these songs was a duet between a man and a woman, all of the other artists were men, so we added one more song by a woman artist, totaling 42 songs featuring women artists. The remaining songs for the child corpus were systematically selected for even distribution, totaling 10 songs for each year. Pop",

Music scholars have noted the problematic “feminine” associations of pop as a genre, particularly in relation to the “masculine” associations of rock ( Coates 1997 , Davies 2001 , Schulze et al. 2019 ). In the context of this binary opposition, rock is privileged through its associations with authenticity and “art,” while pop is disparagingly associated with commercialism and mass culture. For example, songs by Black women may be more likely to be categorized as pop or R&B, even when they are stylistically aligned with hip-hop; see, for example, the earlier discussion of Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” ( Johnson 2018 ).  Representation in pop is also problematized by biased practices that limit opportunities for artists based on gender and race (see Donze 2011 for evidence that women and minority artists have access to a more limited range of commercially viable artist persona types). Furthermore, many available lists for potential popular-music corpora do not accurately represent the success of marginalized artists. For example, pointing specifically to the enthusiasm for woman artists manifested in popular culture in the late 90s, scholars have argued that this apparent upsurge of successful women in music is not reflected in the Billboard Top 40 charts ( Lafrance, Worcester, and Burns 2011 ) or in the Billboard Top 200 Album charts ( Wells 2001 ).",

The pop genre uses significantly more prechoruses than expected, while metal and hip-hop use fewer. This observation aligns with other research on this section: Summach ( 2011 ), for instance, identifies the prechorus as arising from phrase types used in ‘70s and ‘80s rock and pop, and flourishing in the top hits of the 1990s. Conversely, it makes sense that genres eschewing mainstream musical norms, like metal, or with distinct stylistic lineages, like hip-hop, feature comparatively fewer prechoruses. On the other hand, we expect a genre like country, which explicitly incorporated elements of pop during the 1990s ( Neal 2021 , Ross 2015 ), to use prechoruses fairly often. Example 11 .

Counteracting these practices in corpus creation is more accurately representative: by expanding the identities of the artists included in a corpus through the ADAS, an analysis will be better situated to identify the variation and diversity within a given musical practice, as we illustrated in our analysis of the interactions among genre, gender, and the prevalence of prechoruses.",

While songs within a genre must share certain stable musical characteristics in order for the genre to be recognizable to consumers—listeners need some way of distinguishing songs that are included and excluded from some genre ( Dahlhaus 1982 , Kallberg 1988 )—different listeners will understand and interact with these songs and their structural characteristics differently. In this sense, genre is not only “in the music” but also in the minds and bodies of groups of people who share certain social conventions ( Holt 2007 , 2). These conventions are themselves created in relation to songs and artists and the contexts in which they are marketed, performed, and experienced. (46)",

It is, after all, the record labels, trade associations, and the groups themselves that package and market the music, and they do so in ways designed to attract the attention and capital of particular groups of consumers. Genre, of course, plays a role in this scheme. For instance, through Billboard ’s chart infrastructure, genre labels were and are largely a function of commercial maneuvering. As Simon Frith writes, genre is a means to “link a music to its market” ( 1996 , 75). However, even a force as hegemonic as global capitalism can have variations and disagreements around the constituency of genres ( Ritchey 2019 ), and nowhere is this more starkly apparent than in how genre definitions change over time ( Brackett 2016 ). Genres usually assume their nascent forms in relation to a catalyzing context from which they are differentiated, gain their identities as outgrowths of other larger genres, and may even at some point drift back into the mainstream. For example, the meaning of “country music” in 1953 was different in 1975, and different again in 2024.

Additionally, as we have shown, this cloud of similar-yet-variable cultural preferences may be influenced by racist, misogynist, xenophobic, and other discriminatory stances, and therefore an anti-discriminatory corpus can select music from the generic nebula that still represents a subset of the corpus while minimally replicating the discriminatory posture of the cultural forces associated with the wider genre.

As White ( 2022 ) argues, a musical corpus analysis is often imagined as the nexus of a feedback loop between communities of listeners and composers/producers, with listeners learning what musical norms to expect by being exposed to a musical corpus and composers exploiting the expectations of their audience for expressive purposes. In our conception of the ADAS, however, we are constructing a corpus as an array of music that could have been heard by an audience being exposed to a particular genre in the 1990s, and music that was written by songwriters attached to that genre in that decade. However, our corpora cannot claim to capture the most likely listening experience of a casual mainstream listener in the 1990s. Such an experience would have been defined by radio play, marketing, media coverage, etc.—all forces that include discriminatory elements. Instead, this experience would be best represented by a corpus of the most-popular, most-purchased, and most-respected music in some genre. In other words, our method is not appropriate for analysts studying the lived experience of listeners ensconced in a culture’s discriminatory forces. However, such an analysis would have to grapple with the inherent racism, misogyny, and other discriminatory forces that curated that experience.",

                "text": "[8.12] We intend our approach to be a tool to advocate for marginalized identities that is generalizable across musical repertoires. While our current focus is on popular music genres and their representations of artists with marginalized gender, racial, and ethnic identities, the ADAS can be modified to address other identities in other musical traditions. Indeed, we hope this essay will challenge the field of music theory to be more intentional and accountable when selecting musical datasets for research purposes. We view the ADAS as an important contribution to empirical music research. To our minds, even if an act of music analysis does not wear its politics on its metaphorical sleeve, the choice of objects for analysis and the selection of methods are implicitly political ( Ewell 2020 ; Palfy and Gilson 2018 ). Our approach is one way to harness these implicit forces for anti-discriminatory purposes and socially responsible research.
