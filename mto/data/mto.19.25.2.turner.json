    "abstract": "This paper explores cultural hybridity in Isang Yun’sGlissées pour violoncelle seul(1970) using a framework based on ideas from the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. The discussion centers on five principal oppositions in the work: Taoist-inspired coalescence/dissolution and the Austro-German sonata cycle;Haupttonand twelve-tone techniques; the evocation of traditional Korean ornamentation and the concept of fixed pitch; the evocation of traditional Korean instruments and the cello timbre; andchangdanrhythmic cycles and twelve-tone prose rhythms. Conclusions drawn from the consideration of each opposition then serve as the basis for comments regarding effective performance, using a framework based on ideas from conductor Markand Thakar.",

Does the action of the work exist in the juxtaposition of different musical cultures or in a patterning of tension and release that is largely independent of culture? German-South African composer Hans Huyssen (b. 1964) has articulated the former position, asking that the cultural identities in his music remain distinct, with the intention that “they would clarify and enhance their respective qualities and differences, which could then be treated with greater mutual understanding and respect” ( 1998 , 6). Conductor Markand Thakar (b. 1955), however, has argued for the latter position, insisting that in directing the listeners’ attention to extramusical thoughts, the performer diminishes their experience of the music itself ( 2011 , 164).",

                "text": "[2] Like many twentieth-century Asian composers, Yun was trained in the Austro-German/Western tradition. His interest in traditional Korean music grew only after he had completed his education in Germany (1957–59) ( Kim 1999 , 45–46). In his music after 1958, Yun, like Bartók, sought to recover a musical culture that had previously played only a minor role in his cultural identity, and then recreate it within the tradition of Westen modernism. Yun, like Bartók, sought to “rediscover a lost heritage,” one which had previously played only a minor role in his cultural identity, and then “use it to reinvent [Korean] musical culture within the larger practices of Western art music” ( Bogue 2003 , 50). Yun consistently argued that his music should be understood as a middle position: “I’m a man living today, and within me is the Asia of the past combined with the Europe of today. My purpose is not an artificial connection, but I’m naturally convinced of the unity of these two elements. For that reason it’s impossible to categorize my music as either European or Asian. I am exactly in the middle” ( Duffie 1987 ). While this integration might make the sort of separation Huyssen describes seem inappropriate, Yun frequently used evocative titles and was at pains to describe the Korean/East Asian elements of his own work, suggesting that he regarded their distinction and contrast with Austro-German/Western elements as essential to its expression (see, for example, Yun 1978b ).",

Similarly, Korean music exists as a part of a multicultural organism with roots in China and branches in Japan. Yun’s own identity was subject to multiple influences as he grew up in Korea during the 1910–45 Japanese occupation, and he first studied Western music in Osaka (1935–37) and Tokyo (1939–41) ( Kim 1999 , 30–32). Accordingly, he generally preferred to describe his influences and the Hauptton technique as “Asian” or “Far Eastern” rather than as simply “Korean” ( Yun 1978b , 57–58). Furthermore, while after his death Yun became a cultural icon in both the Republic of Korea and the DPRK, scholar Jin-Ah Kim has pointed out that during his lifetime, Yun’s projection of his cultural identity was not universally accepted in Korea, as to Koreans, “it simply did not sound Korean, rather it sounded western” ( 2015 , 51).",

                "text": "[4] Thakar has argued that issues of cultural identity, extramusical associations, and even historic performance practice are ultimately irrelevant: performers achieve the “sublime experience of musical beauty” only through the perception of a musical work as an undivided whole, or as a unitarily apprehensible object ( 2011 , 54). This is achieved through the creation of impulse (tension) and its consequent (or equivalent) resolution (168). While he is certainly correct, Thakar’s discussion is predominantly oriented toward the common-practice period. While he acknowledges that it is possible to create and resolve an impulse outside the tonal system, he does not pursue the topic in any detail (126). In Yun’s hybrid style and eccentric twelve-tone idiom, the means by which impulse and consequent resolution are effected are not entirely clear. Thus, some consideration of the culturally distinct elements in his music, particularly with regard to the mutual transformation that occurs in their combination, seems necessary for the performer. This paper explores such issues in Yun’s Glissées pour violoncelle seul (composed in 1970 and published in 1971), using a framework inspired by the ideas of philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, and then drawing inferences regarding the patterning of impulse and consequent resolution to inform performance.

                "text": "[5] Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas are particularly appropriate for Yun’s music, as they facilitate discussion of complex interactions between heterogeneous elements. As they assert, “Music is a creative, active operation that consists in deterritorializing the refrain . . . . We call a refrain any aggregate of matters of expression that draws a territory and develops into territorial motifs and landscapes ” ( 1987 , 300 and 323; emphasis in the original). In Glissées , the East Asian/Korean and Western/Austro-German refrains are composed of multiple individual elements, or milieus . Deleuze and Guattari describe a milieu as “a coded block of space-time constituted by the periodic repetition of the component” (313). Milieus exist to interact; Deleuze and Guattari explain that they exist in “a perpetual state of transcoding or transduction,” where “transcoding or transduction is the manner in which one milieu serves as the basis for another, or conversely is established atop another milieu, dissipates in it or is constituted in it” (313). These interactions occur both (1) within the separate refrains, as for example, the Italian cello was transduced into German-Austrian orchestral and chamber music, or the Korean haegŭm was transcoded from the Chinese erhu ; and also (2) between the two refrains, as the cello timbre is again transduced through the evocation of the Korean haegŭm .",

Deleuze and Guattari observe that the process of territorialization actually involves a decoding of the milieus, such that those that participate in the territory may be differentiated from others that do not (322). Bogue clarifies: “the territorializing act proceeds via a detachment, decoding, or ‘deterritorialization’ of milieu components and a reinscription, recoding, or ‘reterritorialization’ of those components as expressive qualities within a territory” ( 2007 , 28). A territory, then, is an assemblage of milieus, and this territorialized assemblage constitutes a refrain.",

This time it is in order to join with the forces of the future, cosmic forces. One launches forth, hazards an improvisation. But to improvise is to join with the World, or meld with it” ( 1987 , 311). As the milieus participating in the territory “join with the World” they continue the process of transcoding and transduction, and the refrain becomes deterritorialized .",

Milieus from the Korean/East Asian and Western /Austro-German refrains are prominent, but decoded. While they retain certain distinguishing characteristics, they lose others, which causes them to function differently. This view is consistent with a Taoist approach Yun frequently described in his own work: according to Chuang Tzu, the wise man would see that in each refrain, “there is both right and wrong . . . that in the end they are reducible to the same thing, once they are related to the pivot of Tao” ( Merton 1965 , 43). The liminal space provides this pivot, where “all movements and oppositions can be seen in their right relationship” (43). Thus, as Yun asserted, his style is neither Asian nor European, but exactly in the middle, what the wise man refers to as the “center of the circle” (43). Furthermore, the concept of milieus existing in a “perpetual state of transcoding or transduction” ( Deleuze and Guattari 1987 , 313) aligns with the Taoist view that everything is always changing: “life is a continual development. All beings are in a state of flux” ( Merton 1965 , 30). Example 1 . Principal oppositions in Yun’s Glissées (pub. 1971) (click to enlarge)",

Correspondingly, the most prominent milieus from the Western/Austro-German refrain include the sonata cycle, the twelve-tone technique, fixed pitch, the cello timbre, and prose rhythm. These may be understood as creating five principal oppositions, as shown in Example 1 . Granted, the milieus in both refrains can, and often do, interact freely and in complex ways. The emergence of Haupttöne out of larger twelve-tone fabric, for example, generally indicates the apices of coalescence/dissolution cycles. Similarly, Haupttöne may be deployed to evoke the themes of a sonata form, serve as the subject of traditional ornamentation, and/or be articulated through rhythmic cycles. Deleuze and Guattari actually describe the interactions of milieus in terms of the rhizome , in which any milieu may decode any other through an interconnected network ( 1987 , 7). For the purposes of this study, however, these five principal oppositions provide a convenient embarkation point for the consideration of the question of external or internal expression.

Coalescence and dissolution are another aspect of Taoist thought that Yun felt was important to understanding his music: The beginning of my music is actually a continuation of something [invisible] that has already been ringing without sounding. Likewise, the seeming end of my music in fact belongs to the unheard sound of the future, and would continue to ring in the unheard sound ( Yun 1985a , 30; quoted and translated in Kim 2012 , 52). The cycle of coalescence , or emergence from something “ringing without sounding,” and dissolution , or fading into “the unheard sound,” shapes conceptual units throughout the work. These units, which are evident on several time-scales, typically begin with fragments , coalesce into phrases , and then dissolve into figuration .

The conceptual unit begins with fragments : the two instances of the F ♯ –D dyad appearing in bb. 1–3. In bb. 4–12, these fragments coalesce into phrases consisting of six-note, end-accented gestures. Finally, the phrases dissolve into figuration with the twofold reiteration of the G ♯ –B dyad in bb. 9–12 and 13–15, and a final compression into the A– B ♭ dyad in bb. 16–18. Significantly, as the conceptual unit moves from one state to the next, the note values are progressively reduced, giving a psychological impression of acceleration. The initial F ♯ –D dyad, for example, accelerates from sixteenth notes into two-thirds of a sixteenth-note triplet as it moves from fragment to phrase. Similarly, the measured sixteenth notes of beat 9 accelerate to unmeasured grace notes in bb. 13–18 as they move from phrase to fragment. The dynamic indications also grow as the gesture emerges and recede as the idea dissolves.",

The progression from fragments to phrases and figuration within each cycle is represented graphically for greater clarity. The first cycle begins with the halting, barely audible fragments of the introduction, coalesces in the sonata, and then dissolves throughout the scherzo. The second cycle begins with the “trio” of the second movement (marked “ pesante ” in the score), coalesces into the slow movement, and then dissolves in the finale, most dramatically in the coda, where an undifferentiated stream of sixteenth notes fades into silence.

In the example, open notes represent significant structural arrivals, particularly as defined by Haupttöne (which will be discussed further below) that define the active register. Closed notes represent temporary arrivals or pitches that principally maintain the active register, generally in the figuration sections. The beat number for each pitch is given between the staves. As the first cycle moves from fragment to phrase , the register expands outward from the opening F ♯ 3 to span three octaves between the E5 and E2 first appearing in bb. 24 and 60 respectively. As the cycle moves to figuration , the register further expands outward to four octaves and a third, between the E6 and C2 first appearing in bb. 123 and 158 respectively. In bb. 20–107 of the scherzo, the register audibly contracts to the comparatively restricted (augmented) eleventh G2– C ♯ 4 of the trio. The C ♯ 5 in b. 148 of the trio seems to form a final step in this dissolution process, rather than participating in the second cycle’s expansion, first down to C2 and then up to A4, reaching a full three octaves by b. 82 of the slow movement.

This difference in registral function is the result of the two movements’ positions in the overall structure. While the second movement effects the dissolution of the first cycle, it must immediately contract in order to effect the coalescence of the second cycle. Consequently, most of the registral expansion has to occur in the first movement, which makes it more inherently dramatic than the third. The last movement has no such restrictions and can simply dissolve into the “unheard sound.”",

(1) Yun regarded such continuity as a characteristic of his style: My music doesn’t have a beginning nor an end. You could combine elements from one piece into another piece very well. This is a Taoist philosophy. Music flows in the cosmos, and I have an antenna which is able to cut out a piece of the stream. The part which I’ve cut out is organized and formed through my own thought and body processes, and I commit it to paper. That’s why my music is always continuous—like the clouds that are always the same but are never alike [to] one to another. ( Duffie 1987 ) The image of tuning in to an existing, continuous stream of music provides a serviceable frame of reference for appreciating the double structure of Glissées . One can easily read the coalescence/dissolution cycles as a reflection of the natural “stream” of cosmic music, which was “organized and formed” into the work’s individual movements. Furthermore, Yun indicates in the work’s preface that these movements may be performed separately. While it might seem that such a performance would deprive them of the context required for their coherence, he effectively suggests that both the whole and the component parts are equivalent “pieces” of the stream; the whole is as fragmentary as the parts are complete and vice versa.",

In character and proportion, the first movement evokes a traditional sonata form, but dramatic opposition is effected through emphasis of the Haupttöne D, B ♭ , and E, rather than aggregates or other inherent characteristics of the row structure. The capricious figuration of the second movement suggests a scherzo. While the ensuing section, marked pesante , would logically suggest a trio, it continues on to the third movement without the traditional da capo . This blurs the pesante section’s function: Is it actually a trio—a self-contained, lower-intensity contrast to the scherzo—or is it merely a connecting transition? It seems both insufficiently defined to be a trio, and curiously substantial for a transition. The finale is similarly decoded: rather than ending with a light rondo or a climactic sonata, the work simply dissolves into swirling waves of figuration.",

In performance, fragments should “want” to pull together, as continuity is the goal. Conversely, figuration should “want” to dissolve. To put it another way, figuration and phrases are inherently active, or directed, while figuration is inherently passive. Any activity in the figurative sections is merely local and serves only to maintain the register. Schenker’s student Felix Salzer (1904–86) has suggested that the very act of identifying musical function is often sufficient to create an intuitive direction for performance. Direction to a goal, he points out, “will need different interpretive shadings” from passive or diffusive motion ( 1962 , 17). Thakar’s directions are more specific: to project musical function on the levels closer to the surface, performers should use dynamic shading, while on the background levels they should use “tempo orientation” ( 2011 , 118).",

Yun’s indications in the second coalescence/dissolution cycle, however, challenge this. As the pesante section of the second movement coalesces into the third movement, the tempo actually slows considerably, from =c. 60 to =c. 46. Similarly, the tempo increases into the fourth movement dissolution, first back to =c. 60, and again into the coda, marked “ schnell .”",

                "text": "[20] To account for situations like this, Thakar’s understanding of “tempo orientation” goes beyond simply the rate of pulse to incorporate the rate of information communicated to the listener . He explains, “That might mean adjusting the speed, and it might mean other factors as well, such as playing louder, or with a greater degree of volume inflections” ( 2011 , 103). From this perspective, the details of the second cycle can support Thakar’s approach. The pesante section includes numerous swells from piano to forte , but their regularity reduces the overall level of contrast in the section and sustains a basic dynamic level of piano , which is inflected to forte , but does not show any overall growth until bb. 143–48, when the swells start building to fortissimo . Furthermore, since the notes generally begin at the low dynamic points of the swells, the articulation becomes less distinct. Both the regularity of the dynamic indications and the subtlety of the articulation serve to reduce the amount of information communicated, and thus allow the pesante to function as a large-scale coalescence, in spite of the faster pulse. In contrast, the third movement is surprisingly loud. This, with the percussive articulation provided by the guitar pick, as well as the frequent accents, microtonal inflections, and indications for vibrato, substantially increase the amount of information communicated to the listener and mitigate the very slow tempo. Finally, the fourth movement is generally very soft until b. 89, and the louder dynamics following are generally either the high points of swells, as in the pesante , or brief bursts that immediately decay into very soft dynamics. The loudest section, from bb. 135–50, is comparatively short and immediately yields to the coda, marked “ immer decresc. bis zum Ende .” Finally, the opening phrases are generally long and feature sustained pitches, while the coda’s constant sixteenth notes provide very little differentiation or patterning. These elements, as in the pesante , serve to reduce the amount of information communicated and effectively allow the movement to function as a large-scale dissolution.

Yun regarded Hauptton technique as the fundamental element of East Asian music, and it is one of the most distinctive elements of his mature style. As he described: Whereas in Western music only a complete group of notes arranged either melodically or harmonically has any importance, it is the individual note, the nucleus, which is the focus of attention in the music of Eastern Asia . . . . For us in the East, the tone already lives in itself. Each tone is subjected to alteration from the moment it sounds until it dies away. It is endowed with ornaments, grace notes, vibrato, glissandi and changes in dynamic; above all, conscious use is made of the natural vibrations of every tone as a means of construction. ( Yun 1978b , 57–58; emphasis in the original) Example 5 . Excerpt from “Yi Saenggang’s Taegŭm Sanjo” (Heo 2002, 93) (click to enlarge) In practice, Haupttöne begin with an introductory ornament, are varied through further ornamentation, timbral variation, and microtonal inflections, and then “settle” or “fade” away ( Kim 1999 , 74 and Kim 2012 , 47–49). This concept is clearly evident in transcriptions of traditional East Asian/Korean music, as shown in Example 5 , an excerpt from a Korean taegŭm sanjo . Here, a sustained E ♭ 6 is introduced by an opening ornament C6–B5, and then embellished with auxiliary notes, pitch bends, grace notes, and vibrato. At the end of the excerpt, the E ♭ 6 yields to the C6 introduced in the third full measure, decreasing in length and metric importance. Example 6 .

The Hauptton E from the first movement, shown in Example 8 , provides a representative instance. While this E5 is clearly a Hauptton , Yun has presented it in a variety of note lengths, punctuated by a nearly equal variety of rests, in irregular groupings of one, two, or three quarter-notes.

He travelled to Europe in 1956 specifically to learn the twelve-tone technique, studied with Rufer himself and Boris Blacher (1903–75), and ultimately attended the Darmstadt courses in 1958. While he was aware of the avant-garde innovations of Boulez, Stockhausen, and others associated with the Darmstadt school, he ultimately rejected them ( Kim 1999 , 37–39). As he began incorporating East Asian/Korean elements into his style, his application of the twelve-tone idiom retained the flexible, pragmatic orientation of his teachers. In such works as Glissées and Piri , he simply cycles through his row forms, occasionally repeating or omitting pitches where he felt they were musically appropriate. This sort of repetition is illustrated in Example 9 . In this instance, C and D are repeated on beat 8. While a repetition of the C– D ♭ dyad (the fifth and sixth pitches in the series) from bb. 5–6 would be defensible as a motivic event, Yun’s procedurally problematic substitution of the D (the second pitch of the series) makes a better melodic connection to the following E. Such substitutions and minor shuffling of the pitches are comparatively rare in the early movements, but become more frequent in the later movements. This is, in fact, consistent with Rufer’s pedagogy; Die Komposition mit zwölf Tönen justifies this practice by citing Schoenberg’s “occasional liberties and deviations” in the later sections of his own works ( 1954 , 119). Yun’s handling of the series becomes even more flexible in Etüden für Flöte(n) solo , and is virtually abandoned in favor of a cellular approach in Salomo and Monolog .",

He generally constructs closely linked conceptual units from row forms whose hexachords share a greater number of invariant segments, while sharper breaks in the continuity appear where such invariants are fewer. In the second movement, for example, the conceptual units comprising the scherzo contain series forms P0 and I3. The pitch structure of these forms, with four invariants in corresponding hexachords, is virtually the same. Similarly, the pesante section, serving as the trio, consists of I9, I8, and P0, each of which shares four invariants in corresponding hexachords with its neighboring form. The shift from the scherzo to the trio, however, juxtaposes P0 and I9, which share only two invariants in corresponding hexachords. This is a significant break not only at the movement level, but also in terms of the larger structure, as it occurs between the two superimposed coalescence/dissolution cycles. Example 10 .

In considering them as the basis for the structural graphs of Examples 4 and 12, they were regarded as prolongations of structural arrivals, and as such, inherently passive. On the surface level, however, Yun seems to have regarded them as active agents of expression. He described them as being alive, deriving their expression from the alterations effected by ornaments, vibrato, and the like, but presumably retaining their essential character as single pitches. Accordingly, it seems worthwhile for performers to approach them as self-contained conceptual units with the same impulse/resolution patterning as conventional melodies. Instead of creating a sense of direction from the changing notes, however, the ornaments and figuration should draw all attention back to the Hauptton itself. In a sense, the Hauptton is the active element and the changing notes are passive expansions or elaborations of its inherent “natural vibration” or energy. The Hauptton E5 in Example 8 would seem to support this conclusion. The Hauptton is activated through alternations in timbre and dynamics. Furthermore, each dynamic component executes a swell that reaches an independent climax, as shown in Example 13 . Pitch alterations in this case support the dynamic inflections, moving down with the diminuendo in beat 30 and up with the fortissimo in beat 34. The Hauptton D3 in the recapitulation of the first movement (bb. 98–111), shown in Example 14 , presents a more dramatic instance. Here, the ornaments grow from the microtonal inflections of bb. 102 and 104 to a veritable explosion of figuration encompassing the entire pitch series in bb. 106–108.

The twelve-tone organization of Glissées generally precludes any such specificity: the several instances of the Haupttöne D, B ♭ , and E in the first movement, for example, do not feature specific, individual ornamentation, but instead appear very differently in each instance. While Injung Song ( 2008 ) devotes considerable space to discussing the relationship between the figuration in Glissées and the traditional categories of nonghyŏn , (2) decoding the modal framework according to twelve-tone techniques, however conceptual, would seem to render any classification of nonghyŏn ( t’oesŏng , ch’usŏng , etc.) ultimately less meaningful than understanding their musical function.

A difficulty arises in the fairly common use of “approximate pitches,” indicated by a square note-head consisting of three parallel vertical strokes, as shown in Example 15 . These approximate pitches generally occur at the ends of slides and are notated as the correct pitches in the series. Since they occur in both loud and soft dynamics, they are clearly intended to sound; the slide should not simply end in silence as the pitch is reached. The combination of imprecision (an approximate pitch) and precision (in this case, F ♮ 5) in Yun’s notation creates something of a puzzle: Would an F ♯ 5 be an acceptable approximation of F ♮ 5? If so, why did Yun include the natural? Was he merely honoring the concept of the series, or are not-quite- F ♯ 5 and not-quite-F5 different pitches? It is possible that Yun had a microtonal inflection in mind; he occasionally indicates quarter-tone pitch bends with a recumbent crescent indication, as shown in Examples 11 and 14. Allowing the evocations of nonghyŏn to decode the integrity of the pitches themselves would seem to be mortally dangerous in a twelve-tone work, particularly when approximate pitches appear in groups, as during the coda of the last movement ( Example 16 ). Since approximate pitches appear more frequently in the figuration sections (the second and fourth movements) however, the greater destabilization created by microtonal inflections may further enhance the sense of dissolution.

No such indications are present in Glissées , in the score or in the performance notes. While this might make the connections with specific instruments somewhat presumptive, scholar Songyoung Kim asserts that this was a common practice of Yun’s ( 2011 , 1). Certainly, the association with the bowed haegŭm seems justifiable, as it has the most in common with the cello timbre. The association with the timbrally distinct kŏmun’go is also plausible, as Yun calls for the third movement to be performed with a guitar pick ( Plektrum ). The resulting sound is markedly different from the traditional cello timbre, and thus suggests an evocation. Not only does the thin, percussive sound produced by the pick evoke the sound of the kŏmun’go , but the broad pitch fluctuations, particularly in bb. 125–43 ( Example 17 ), also suggest the characteristic ornamentation of Asian zithers created by pressing on the strings behind the tuning bridges after they have been sounded.

The sound created by the friction of the bow stick suggests the distinctive “buzzing” timbre of the taegŭm , created by the vibration of a thin membrane extracted from the inside of a reed or bamboo stalk ( Heo 2002 , 6). Furthermore, the first use of this technique ( Example 18 ) also features sharp, initial accents. These evoke the articulation of the taegŭm , which is achieved through airspeed rather than tonguing ( Heo 2002 , 47).

Changdan (literally “long-short”) are underlying rhythmic patterns performed on the changgo , an hourglass-shaped, double-sided drum ( Howard, Chae-suk, and Casswell 2008 , 60). Modern transcriptions, as in the excerpt from Yi Saenggang’s Taegŭm sanjo ( Example 19 ), generally show the underlying changdan pattern, and then present the melodic part, divided into metric units corresponding to the pattern. The changdan merely provides the structure for the changgo drummer, whose improvisations support the melodic part while articulating the strong beats of the cycle. Since the literature incorporating changdan is transmitted orally, the patterning is rarely as regular as the transcriptions make it appear. Howard, Chae-suk, and Casswell also acknowledge that, in performance, “there is a tendency to reduce phrase lengths,” which undermines the changdan’s periodicity, and discuss several such deviations in a recorded performance of kagayum sanjo ( 2008 , 60–64 and 82).",

In the case of Glissées , any evocation of specific changdan would necessarily be rather abstract; in Loyang and Gasa , the changgo is evoked by accompanying instruments, while Glissées is unaccompanied. While Yun employs occasional percussive effects, their infrequency and wide separation makes any evocation of the changgo unlikely. Furthermore, the changdan discussed in Howard, Chae-suk, and Casswell 2008 are predominantly in compound meter, while Glissées is in simple time and unmetered throughout. Example 20 .

It is also significant that the patterning is frequently disrupted (as in Example 20a) or inexact (Example 20b). In Example 20a, the pattern of 3 + 4 eighth notes is immediately challenged by the off-beat triplet on beat 8. This slight hesitation suggests the improvisatory aspect of changdan and is elaborated even further in bb. 12 and 13, in which the first attack point is delayed by a sixteenth and the second anticipated by the triplet.

That is, as performers alter changdan patterns through improvisation and truncation, they act as continuously decoded milieus. In Glissées , they also act as milieus, but, out of their context of improvisation and oral tradition, they are continuously decoded by the prose rhythms Yun inherited from Rufer. Thus, rhythmic cycles, when present, appear as a series of flexible rhythmic shapes. At the beginning of the third movement, for example, Yun presents eight iterations of an essential pattern consisting of an ornamented long note, a dotted rhythm, and a short, sometimes ornamented punctuation. Example 21 presents a paradigmatic analysis of these iterations, arranged vertically to facilitate comparison. The essential pattern is presented most clearly in iterations 3 and 6. Iterations 1, 7, and 8 omit the dotted rhythm, while iterations 4 and 5 omit the punctuation. Iteration 2 is the least typical, presenting the dotted rhythm at double speed and expanding the punctuation to five notes. Throughout the passage, Yun varies the pattern further by changing the overall length from three to six quarter beats, changing the number of grace notes, and/or slowing them to sixteenth or thirty-second values, as in iterations 7 and 8.

While the East Asian/Korean and Austro-German/Western refrains are not perhaps as distinct as the refrains that Huyssen seems to expect (perhaps as they are found in his own work), regarding them in terms of deterritorialization acknowledges the complexity of cultural identities and avoids essentialist stereotypes. Understanding Glissées as occupying a liminal space reveals a background structure of coalescence/dissolution cycles defined by the emergence and dissolution of Haupttöne , which exist in tension with the four notated movements. These Haupttöne are arranged into intervallic or linear sequences that provide a framework for the creation of impulse and its consequent resolution at the middleground levels. Finally, the evocation of traditional ornamentation and instruments brings more variety to the foreground, and rhythmic cycling complements the Haupttöne and brings greater clarity to the grouping of the figural sections.",

As noted previously, Yun’s work was initially met with resistance in Korea, and indeed, after the debut recording of Glissées in 1975 by Siegfried Palm ( 1975 ) (the work’s dedicatee), the work was not recorded again in its entirety for nearly forty years. (3) However, Yun’s “future people” may well have arrived. Sociologist Jan Nederveen Pieterse has argued that hybridity “is a terminology and sensibility of our time in that boundary and border-crossing mark our times” ( 2001 , 238). In the last decade, five new recordings have appeared ( Brand 1991 ; Cheah 2014 ; Grenet 2015 ; Haimovitz 2018 ; and Meissner 2014 ), and the work has served as the subject of two doctoral dissertations ( Ko 2008 ; Song 2008 ). While this new popularity might well be attributable to Palm’s teaching legacy and Korean Nationalism, it is tempting to read this recognition in light of the growing prominence of the hybrid J-pop and K-pop genres, or music from the Final Fantasy franchise, all of which is interesting precisely for the ways in which it freely combines elements drawn from a broad range of contrasting styles, eras, and countries. At their best, these hybrid pieces open creative possibilities and affirm Pieterse’s assertion that “hybridity is deeply rooted in history and quite ordinary” ( 2001 , 221).",
