    "abstract": "A central concern for theories of form in pop/rock music is the division of a song into sections and, consequently, the categorization of these sections according to a standard set of section labels. Psychological research on categorization shows that it is inherently a perceptual process, one that involves graded membership and fuzzy boundaries. Thus in contrast to prior theorists, who often attempt to minimize ambiguity in the analysis of form in pop/rock music, I confront ambiguity directly, organizing and describing many of the common types encountered. I focus exclusively on the time period 1982–1991, when verse-chorus form can be considered to have achieved widespread currency. After providing an illustrative exemplar, I discuss three types of ambiguity common to this decade, each based on the main section role involved: 1) verse ambiguity, which typically derives from weak section differentiation; 2) chorus ambiguity, which usually involves a blend of more than one section role; and 3) bridge ambiguity, which often results from different hierarchical meanings of the bridge label.",

In a compound “AABA” form, the “B” group may still be considered “bridge” material. Indeed, Covach implies as much in his description of compound AABA form: “In a compound AABA form, each A section contains at least one verse and a chorus section . . .

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this process is not always straightforward, since two different analysts sometimes provide two different interpretations of the same song. For example, the form of the U2 song “One” (1991) has been analyzed in at least two different ways, as shown in Example 1a . Endrinal ( 2008 , 148) views the song primarily as an alternation of verse and chorus sections, whereas Harris ( 2006 , 98–99) views it primarily as a succession of verse sections only. (1) We may naturally wonder, therefore: What factors underlie this and other instances of disagreement in the analysis of form in pop/rock music?",

(2) On one hand, the passage that Endrinal labels as a chorus ( Example 1b ) sounds rather chorus-like in contrast to the preceding material. Most notably, the melody rises into a higher register along with a corresponding lift in the harmonies to the relative major, which are features that theorists have associated with verse-chorus pairings. (3) On the other hand, there is very little if any textural change between the first eight bars and the second eight, which dampens our sense that these sixteen bars cleave into two separate sections. Another factor involves the lyrics. In particular, many explanations of form in pop/rock music observe that the lyrics of a verse typically change each time its music reappears, whereas the lyrics of a chorus typically do not (e.g., Stephenson 2002 , 134–35; Everett 2009 , 145). As Example 1c shows, the lyrics for each iteration of Endrinal’s chorus section are considerably different, with “one” being the only significant word shared among all four instances of the passage. Overall, therefore, the differences in interpretation observed here appear to derive from conflicting perceptual cues within different domains (harmony, melody, texture, lyrics), each of which has the potential to confirm or contradict a given reading. In short, the form of the song is ambiguous.",

                "text": "[1.3] To some, the lack of agreement on the form of this song may seem like a rare occurrence—too rare to deserve closer attention. Neal, for example, writes that “the mere act of labeling sections of a song is little more than a rote exercise, one that is easily and frequently taught to undergraduate students of popular music” ( 2007 , 44), implying that partitioning a song into sections and applying standard form labels is usually a clear-cut process. And it may be so, if done alone. But in my own experience—both in analyzing songs and reading other’s analyses—I find form in pop/rock music to be a very subjective topic. (Form in common-practice era music is no different, considering the panoply of approaches that have been offered to describe the form of the first movement of a sonata.) (4) It is impossible to quantify the true extent of subjectivity in the analysis of form in pop/rock music, of course, although some recent work sheds light on the issue. In a study by Bruderer, McKinney, and Kohlrausch ( 2006 ), for example, listeners were asked to label structural boundaries in six full-length popular songs. The authors found that, of all the boundaries identified, only a few were agreed upon by all participants. In a similar study by Smith ( 2014 ), trained musicians independently labeled structural boundaries in a large and stylistically diverse corpus of recordings. Allowing for one or two bars of leeway, participants agreed on the location of segment boundaries about 77% of the time. (5) More recently, I examined the extent of section-label agreement in the corpus of rock songs I created with David Temperley ( de Clercq 2017 ). When grouping section labels into general categories (verse, chorus, bridge), I found that our section labels matched 67% of the time, given any particular moment in the corpus. Thus while analysts may not often wildly disagree on the form of a song (after all, even Endrinal and Harris agree that roughly half of “One” contains verse material), we can expect to regularly find a good deal of variation from one interpretation to another.

                "text": "[1.4] If structural boundaries and section labels in pop/rock music are often ambiguous, how should a theory of form in pop/rock respond? (6) One approach would be to try and reduce this ambiguity by more strictly defining the standard section labels, taking care to hew to these definitions in analytical practice. Harris, for example, states that the passages Endrinal labels as the chorus in “One” are “clearly not choruses” due to the lack of strict lyric repetition ( 2006 , 98). In other words, lyric repetition is an essential quality of a chorus, and without this feature, a section cannot be a chorus. Similarly strict approaches to section categorization can be found in the writing of other theorists. Endrinal himself, for example, writes that the middle passage (around 2:11, Example 2a ) of the song “Elevation” (U2, 2000) “cannot be called a ‘bridge’” because it lacks transitional function ( 2008 , 78). Osborn analyzes “Don’t Stop Believin’” (Journey, 1981) in much the same way, stating that while most people would hear the final passage (beginning around 3:21, Example 2b ) as the chorus of the song, it is “ not a chorus” (emphasis in the original) because it occurs only at the end of the song ( 2010 , 19). In each of these cases, the author implies that a particular feature—e.g., lyric repetition, transitional function, recurrence in the song—is an essential element for applying a section label. In the field of cognitive psychology, this outlook is commonly referred to as a “classical” categorization scheme ( Murphy 2002 , 12–16), whereby membership in a category, such as “chorus” or “bridge,” is an all-or-nothing affair, hinging on the existence of one or more essential qualities. For both Endrinal and Osborn, this outlook gives rise to the coinage of new section labels, such as “interverse” ( Endrinal 2011 ) and “terminal climax” ( Osborn 2013 ), so as to account for song sections that do not conform to certain aspects of conventional section labels. Our approach to ambiguity, therefore, has the power to shape the analytical systems we devise.",

Indeed, research within the field of cognitive psychology (e.g., Rosch 1973 , Rosch 1978 , Smith and Medin 1981 ) has shown that classical categorization—a definition-based approach that relies on essential elements for category membership—does a poor job of modeling the way that humans naturally conceptualize and understand the world around them. (7) Instead, the categories that humans use, and the concepts those categories represent, are better considered to be graded (or fuzzy), with certain members more central than others. Ambiguity, in other words, is not just a fundamental component in the analysis of form in pop/rock music but is fundamental to all mental tasks that involve categorization. For example, the debate among pop/rock theorists about what harmonic entities do or do not qualify as instances of “dominant” is evidence that the categorization of harmonic function is a fuzzy process (see, for example: Doll 2009 , Biamonte 2010 , Nobile 2016 ). But although previous authors have conceded that form labels in pop/rock can often be unclear (e.g., Stephenson 2002 , 133), no published work has yet closely investigated the types of ambiguity typically encountered and the mechanisms by which these types of ambiguity arise. (8) I believe this to be an essential task for understanding form in pop/rock music, as I have found that many if not most well-known songs, especially those that have achieved great critical acclaim, involve ambiguous formal structures. In other words, part of the appeal of these songs may derive from the interesting ways in which they manipulate the conventions of form.",

As I argue, it is often preferable to adopt a “both/and” approach to section labels rather than the mutually exclusive “either/or” approach that pervades extant published analyses. Admittedly, this methodology is concerned greatly with taxonomy. (9) But as Lakoff and Johnson argue ( 1980 ), the words we use significantly affect the way we view the world. I begin my discussion below with an illustrative song example that expresses relatively clear section roles. From this reference point, I move outwards to examine ambiguous moments in verse, chorus, and bridge identity, since these three section roles are the most commonly used in analysis and thus most often participate in section-role ambiguity. As I show, the mechanism by which ambiguity occurs often corresponds to the main section role involved: verse ambiguity typically derives from weak section differentiation, chorus ambiguity usually involves a blend of more than one section role, and bridge ambiguity often results from different hierarchical meanings of the “bridge” label.",

I delimit the time frame in this way because the same form label may hold different meanings, and thus evoke different conceptual frameworks, within different historical contexts. We should not expect, for example, the term “bridge” to have the same meaning in popular music of the 1940s, ‘50s, and early ‘60s—where it typically refers to the middle passage of an AABA form—as it does in music from the late 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s—where it more often refers to the middle passage of a verse-chorus form. I have chosen the particular timespan of 1982–1991 for a number of reasons. For one, we find a shifting of form types during the early years of rock music, as noted in the work of Covach ( 2006 ), Summach ( 2011 ), and von Appen and Frei-Hauenschild ( 2015 ). By the early 1980s, however, form types crystallize around the verse-chorus configuration, with verse-chorus forms accounting for arguably all of the #1 Billboard hits by 1982. (10) This is not to say that other form types did not still exist after 1982, only that the overwhelmingly dominant blueprint for a pop/rock song by 1982 (or thereabouts) was the verse-chorus form. Of course, verse-chorus form continues to be a common scheme for hit songs on the charts of today. In 1992, however, the Billboard charts saw a dramatic increase in rap and dance tracks to high chart positions, and the typical forms used in these newer styles may be somewhat different than the typical forms in pop/rock music from the decade prior; thus I have chosen an end date of 1991.

Of the numerous theories that have been proposed (see Murphy 2002 ), I will focus on just two that I find particularly applicable here: the exemplar view and the prototype view. In the exemplar view, your understanding of the concept of “chorus,” for example, involves the set of hundreds or thousands of passages that you have previously judged to be choruses, some of which are more memorable than others (for whatever reason). When you hear a particular passage in a new song, you compare that passage to the set of passages previously judged to be choruses. In contrast, the prototype view posits that your understanding of the concept of “chorus” involves comparison to a summary representation, which is essentially a set of weighted attributes. (12) From a lifetime of listening to songs, for instance, you know that “loudness” and “lyric repetition” are both typical attributes for sections you have judged to be choruses. When you hear a new passage, you assess membership to the chorus category by comparing the attributes of this new passage to the attributes in your summary representation. Note that these two theories are similar: Do you compare a new passage to a set of abstracted features derived from previously-heard songs, or do you compare a new passage to the common features of a set of remembered passages? This question is moot, since neither theory fully accounts for all of the empirical evidence on conceptual categorization. Presumably, you use both methods, along with a number of other possible strategies, such as family resemblances, feature combinations, and schemata. (13) Without a doubt, comprehensive theories of conceptual categorization are messy. (14) Example 3a . “I Don’t Wanna Cry” (Mariah Carey, 1990), annotated recording (click to watch) Example 3b .

(15) That said, I will provide one illustrative example here, Mariah Carey’s Billboard #1 hit song “I Don’t Wanna Cry” (1990), which I have chosen because it evinces relatively clear instances of section roles and the prototypical arrangement of these sections. The song can be heard in Example 3a , and my conception of the song’s form is shown in Example 3b . In my form chart, I provide not only the local section labels (e.g., verse, prechorus, chorus) but also the higher-level grouping structure, which I hear as a large-scale AABA pattern, or “compound AABA”. (16) (The diagonal lines in the grouping structure represent the possibility of hearing the link material as belonging to the A or B groups; more on that below.) By using this song as a reference point, I do not mean to imply that it portrays the best template or the only template for form in pop/rock music. (It is not the prototypical song, it is simply a prototypical song.) When looking at the form chart in Example 3b, though, I hope the reader recognizes a highly standardized song structure, one that includes all (or at least most) of the conventional form labels commonly used to describe the sections of a verse-chorus song. The fact that this song has so many different section roles is an important factor in the perceptual clarity of its form. Because the verse and chorus sections in “I Don’t Wanna Cry” are so clear and distinct, for example, we are encouraged to hear the intervening material as the prechorus. Section roles, in other words, mutually reinforce one another here.",

For reference, Example 3c transcribes the melody, lyrics, and chords of the song up until the second verse. (17) In terms of harmony, both the verse and chorus are relatively stable. But the chorus emphasizes the major tonic (A major), whereas the verse emphasizes the relative minor—a common scheme for verse-chorus pairings ( Doll 2011 ). Note as well that the chorus includes internal text repetition (which is a common feature of chorus sections), since the title of the song occurs not only at the beginning of the section but also at its end. I consider this repeated title text to be a refrain, even though some authors allow for a refrain to occur only at the end of a verse. (18)",

In terms of instrumentation, the sparse texture of the verse becomes more lively and thick, with a busier acoustic guitar part, a move into a higher register by the synthesized strings, and the addition of synthesized background vocals. A transitional quality can also be seen in the register of the prechorus melody, which shifts from the lower tessitura of the verse to the higher tessitura of the chorus. Admittedly, this prechorus may seem somewhat short, at only four bars in the meter I have chosen. In terms of absolute time, though, it lasts about as long—at roughly 15 seconds—as many prechorus sections that other theorists have identified, such as the 15-second prechorus in “Talking in Your Sleep” (The Romantics, 1984) that Summach ( 2011 ) uses as his primary example.

The word “link” has received some currency in recent scholarly literature ( Stephenson 2002 , 134; Endrinal 2008 , 68–69), which is why I use it here, but a variety of alternative labels can also be found, including “interlude,” “turnaround,” and “Janus module.” (19) As is common in other songs, the link recycles the intro material, thereby restarting the verse–prechorus–chorus cycle. Note the dramatic drop in texture and the return to F ♯ minor, for example. At the same time, however, the link acts as the end of the chorus, which is especially salient in this song since the title line in the vocal melody spills over into the link. Indeed, this spillover of the title line into the link is a relatively common feature for chorus-link boundaries. (20) Mariah Carey’s repetition of the title line in the middle of the link (around m. 29) creates a further connection between the link and the chorus. The link material, therefore, can be seen to both end the first large-scale A group and begin the second large-scale A group, as reflected by the diagonal line in the grouping column in my form chart above.

One factor supporting a hearing of this passage as the bridge is that it occurs exactly where we would expect a bridge, i.e., after the second iteration of the chorus and before the final iteration of the chorus. Another factor is that the bridge is harmonically unstable, as it spawns an expressive “pump-up” modulation from the original key of A major to the new key of B ♭ major. (21) The melody here is soaring, with the F ♯ in m. 57 and the F ♮ in m. 59 being the highest notes reached yet in the lead vocal. And the lyrics, all of which are new, seem to summarize the sentiment of the song in a way that is comparable to the role of the chorus itself. Viewing this passage as the bridge, it stands as the main component of the large-scale “B” group, providing contrast between the end of the second “A” group and the abbreviated final “A” group. I thus see two levels of “bridge” quality here: one at the section level (the vocal bridge itself) and another at the grouping level. (22) The idea that “bridge-ness” can exist on different hierarchical levels of a song’s form is a central factor in creating section ambiguity, as I show later in the paper.",

Indeed, the material in Example 3d is built on the same harmonic progression as the prechorus (mm. 15–18 of Example 3c). It is fairly common, however, for two separate sections of a pop/rock song to share the same harmonic content, as exemplified by Covach’s “simple verse-chorus” form ( 2005 ). Ultimately, I find it somewhat hard to say whether mm. 55–59 in “I Don’t Wanna Cry” represent a bridge or a recomposed prechorus; since either section role might precede a final chorus, both analyses seem plausible. The fact that this song contains some ambiguity with regard to section roles may seem to compromise its function as an illustrative example. But in my experience, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to find a commercially successful song from this era that includes all of the typical section roles without any element of ambiguity. I might be able to offer a song with a clear verse and a clear chorus section, for example, but it would lack a clear prechorus. As I hope to convince the reader with the following examples, pop/rock songs consistently challenge our conceptual categorization schemes, if only because real music involves so many perceptual parameters. “Second Verse, Same as the First”",

I begin with those situations in which it is not clear whether a passage should be considered one long span of verse or a verse plus some other section, such as a verse followed by a chorus or a verse followed by a prechorus. This is the simplest and most common type of formal ambiguity in pop/rock music, and as such, may be the most familiar to the reader. Generally speaking, verse ambiguity arises from weak differentiation between the verse material itself and the material that follows. Example 4 .

                "text": "[3.2] At the beginning of this essay, we saw an instance of weak verse-chorus differentiation in the song “One” by U2. The lack of clear verse-chorus separation in that case was due in large part to an absence of strong chorus attributes in the domain of lyrics. Yet even when the lyrics of a song more strongly convey chorus quality, verse-chorus separation may still be relatively weak due to a lack of differentiation in other domains. The song “When Doves Cry” (Prince & the Revolution, 1984) provides a good example in this regard. In particular, the opening 32 bars of vocal material ( Example 4 ) have been analyzed as one long span of verse material ( Temperley 2013 ) and alternatively as a 16-bar verse followed by a 16-bar chorus ( Summach 2012 , 108–9). I have omitted chord symbols from my transcription, since the underlying harmonies are somewhat unclear; certainly, harmony plays no significant role in differentiating the first half of these 32 bars from the second half. Nor does the melody seem to participate in section differentiation, since neither the phrase structure nor the pitch content change significantly from the first half to the second half. The perception of a chorus section hinges primarily on two factors. The first is the very slight thickening of texture, achieved in the first iteration of this material through the addition of the synthesizer lead as well as a more consistent doubling of the lead vocal. That said, the change in texture is rather subtle; no distorted guitars or heavy drums come in. The second and perhaps strongest factor is the lyrics: the text from the second half of the opening 32-bar passage repeats almost exactly at later points in the song (both at 2:04 and 2:50), and some internal repetition (“Maybe I’m just . . . . ”) occurs as well. Nonetheless, the internal repetition is mild and does not include the title of the song. Perhaps, then, the repetition of lyrics here is simply a case of “second verse, same as the first.” (23)",

If we are looking for a chorus in this song, we can find one. But if we are not necessarily looking for a chorus, we may not hear it. Again, we could strictly define the category of “chorus” to be, for example, those passages that repeat lyrics on future iterations; and by that rubric, “When Doves Cry” has a chorus while “One” does not. Yet to my ears, a standalone chorus is more salient in “One” than in “When Doves Cry,” primarily because of the musical features that participate in my overall assessment of the passage. This is not to say, of course, that one song has a chorus and the other does not. Rather, the existence of a chorus depends on subjective weighting of a variety of musical and lyrical attributes, some of which may convey conflicting information. Example 5 .

                "text": "[3.4] Perhaps the most commonly encountered type of ambiguity in pop/rock form involves the issue of whether a passage is a refrain or standalone chorus. This type of ambiguity is similar to the previous case, as it affects whether we hear the song as a one-part form (verse only) or a two-part form (verse-chorus). (24) The song “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” (U2, 1987) provides an excellent example in this regard, since the opening 24-bar vocal passage of the song ( Example 5 ) has been analyzed as a 16-bar verse followed by an 8-bar chorus ( Scott 2003 , 411; Temperley 2013 ) and also as a 24-bar verse in which the last eight bars constitute a refrain ( Harris 2006 , 210–12; Endrinal 2008 , 147). Undeniably, the last eight bars of this 24-bar passage are the most chorus-like moment of the main material, but do they rise to the level of separating from the verse to stand as their own discrete section? On one hand, these eight bars seem long enough to warrant being considered a separate unit. But on the other hand, the last eight bars unmistakably act as the completion of a single harmonic and phrase arc that spans the larger 24-bar passage as a whole. Especially for those listeners familiar with the blues, the last eight bars sound very much like two iterations of the final cadential 4-bar phrase of a 12-bar blues. Here again, it appears that if listeners want to analyze the song as having a chorus, they can; if not, there is no overwhelming perceptual evidence to do so. Example 6a .

In particular, if the chorus of a song is clear, it may be unclear whether the material preceding this chorus should be considered one cohesive span of verse or a verse section followed by a prechorus. The song “Smells Like Teen Spirit” (Nirvana, 1991) provides a good illustration of this situation, since some theorists have analyzed it as including verse, prechorus, and chorus sections ( Doll 2011 [15]; Adams 2015 , 9) while others have partitioned it as verse and chorus sections only with no prechorus ( Covach 2009 , 512; Temperley 2013 ). At issue is whether the eight bars prior to the chorus should be considered a standalone prechorus or simply more verse material ( Example 6a ). Unlike clearer examples of prechorus sections, we find no change of harmony prior to the chorus. Harmonic instability and harmonic contrast may be such strong factors in our perception of a prechorus that their absence significantly mutes our perception of a separate prechorus section. Undoubtedly, a change in the bass line during the eight bars prior to the chorus, as can be heard in my recomposition in Example 6b , would more strongly convey the sense of a discrete prechorus. But the lack of such a change does not nullify the transitional, prechorus-like elements heard in other domains. In terms of texture, for example, the sparse instrumentation of the first eight bars of the verse becomes thicker in the next eight bars as the hi-hat opens up (and thus becomes louder and resonates longer), the vocals become doubled, and the electric guitar becomes more distorted and active, all elements that presage the dramatic textural change in the chorus. The lyrics also depart from our expectations of verse material, in that they become more internally repetitive and repeat on future iterations.",

In some cases, it may not be clear where a prechorus label would even begin, as when prechorus-like attributes have staggered entrances. An example of this scenario can be found in the song “Run to You” (Bryan Adams, 1984). The opening vocal passage of this song ( Example 7a ) begins with eight bars of clear verse material and, after eight more bars, we hear a clear chorus section.

As a result, the rhyme scheme in the lyrics becomes more compressed, going from a rhyme every four bars to a rhyme every two bars. This increased pace can be viewed as a transition towards the 2-bar repetitions of the title text in the chorus itself. Moreover, the melodic content beginning in m. 17 emphasizes the high A ♭ , which foreshadows the high, metrically accented A ♭ in the first half of the chorus. Yet although some transitional aspects can be observed in the third 4-bar hypermeasure, the guitars and bass continue to repeat the same harmonic content found earlier (albeit only the latter half of the main riff). In the fourth 4-bar hypermeasure (“When it gets too much”), however, we hear a significant harmonic move away from this repeating chord pattern, with the ♭ VI– ♭ VII motion strongly preparing the arrival of the minor tonic at the beginning of the chorus. (25) Additionally, the texture noticeably thickens, as the drums shift from a side-stick pattern to a standard kick-snare pattern. The bass guitar also intensifies the feeling of forward drive through its straight eighth-note part. As a final factor, note that while most of the lyrics prior to the chorus do not repeat on the second iteration of this passage, the line “I need to feel your touch” does repeat when this material returns later in the song.

I borrow the term “blend” from the field of linguistics to refer to those situations in which aspects of two (or more) section roles appear to exist within the same passage ( Denham and Lobeck 2009 , 197). Just as the term “brunch” is a blend of the seemingly mutually exclusive categories of “breakfast” and “lunch,” for instance, some passages in pop/rock music may be seen to blend characteristics of two seemingly mutually exclusive section roles. “Don’t Bore Us, Get to the Chorus”",

Following this verse material, we hear in mm. 17–24 what sounds very much like the prechorus of the song, in significant part due to the unstable nature of the harmonic content, which moves from the subdominant at its beginning to a “soul dominant” (A/B) at the end.

Most notably, the guitar riff of the intro returns, just as would normally happen in a link section, which typically heralds a restart of the large-scale grouping structure. The brevity of the passage is also much more characteristic of a link than a chorus.

Another excellent example occurs in the song “Jump” (Van Halen, 1984). Like “Hip to Be Square,” “Jump” begins with a well-defined riff in the introduction, played here on synthesizer, as can be heard in Example 9a . The vocal material that follows strongly warrants being partitioned into three distinct sections. The first section, mm. 17–32, seems to clearly act as verse material; the second section, mm. 33–41, is a nine-bar span of less harmonically stable material; and in the third section, mm. 42–49, we hear a return of the introductory riff along with fragmented repetitions of the title text. Summach analyzes these three vocal sections as verse, prechorus, and chorus, respectively ( 2012 , 316), which is probably the way that most listeners would interpret these sections given existing approaches to form in pop/rock music. But there is something about mm. 42–49 that make them feel as if the chorus quality is somewhat mitigated. One aspect is the relative sparseness of the main vocal. Another is the completely static nature of its harmonic content. Especially in contrast to the strong feeling of motion and momentum in mm. 33–41, mm. 42–49 seem somewhat flat and unexciting, at least from a harmonic perspective. In addition, there is no thickening of texture as we might expect in a chorus; instead, the accompaniment thins out in a return to the opening texture. Overall, mm. 42–49 seem like an afterthought rather than a climactic point, as if the main thrust of the song has already passed. This afterthought quality may also relate to the organization of the vocal melody, which is so strongly end-accented—as would be characteristic of vocal material in a prototypical link—that it conveys a substantial sense of closure. For these reasons, I perceive “Jump” as another instance in which link and chorus roles combine into a single passage. As in “Hip to Be Square,” this chorus/link blend moves immediately back to the verse, without any intervening material, since link and chorus roles have merged. Example 9b . Second iteration of main vocal material in “Jump” (Van Halen, 1984) Example 10 . Main vocal material in “The Power of Love” (Huey Lewis and the News, 1985) (click to enlarge and listen)",

I have presumed this harmonically unstable passage to be the prechorus, but it has at least one element of chorus-like quality due to this text repetition. The fact that this second section has the thickest texture of the three main sections further reinforces this feeling of chorus quality. We could thus consider the main material in Example 9a to be a verse-chorus-link form, with mm. 33–41 acting as the chorus and mm. 42–49 acting as the link. Some readers may balk at accepting this analysis, as chorus quality may seem stronger in mm. 42–49 than in mm. 33–41. But it will be useful to keep this additional layer of ambiguity in mind as we consider the following two examples.",

There are obviously three distinct sections: an 8-bar C-minor passage in mm. 21–28 that clearly acts as verse material, a 9-bar C-major passage in mm. 29–37, and a shorter 4-bar passage back in C minor in mm. 38–41, after which the song returns to another verse (not shown in my transcription). Notice how similar this song is in construction to the other Huey Lewis and the News song discussed above, “Hip to Be Square” (Examples 8a and 8b). Both have an 8-bar verse, followed by transitional material that leads up to a strong dominant chord, which prepares the title overlap into a 4-bar passage that includes the return of the main riff along with a repeat of the title text two bars later. For these reasons, we might hear “The Power of Love” as evincing a verse section, followed by a 9-bar prechorus, which then leads to a chorus/link blend. Summach ( 2012 , 318), however, labels mm. 29–37 in “The Power of Love” as the chorus, and there are good reasons to do so. The lyrics of this middle passage, for example, repeat at each appearance of the section; the lead vocal has a generally higher register than the sections before and after it; and the texture is also thicker than the surrounding sections, with the hi-hat opening up and a distorted guitar doubling the bass.",

Harmony perhaps contributes in large part to that feeling. Although one could say that mm. 29–37 in “The Power of Love” begin a tonic sonority (C major) and are thus somewhat more stable than a typical prechorus, the recurring C-major chord does not have the same strength of tonic quality, at least to my ears, as does the C-minor chord that begins the verse and reappears in m. 38. It is hard to fully explain why, although the rising bass line, which quickly puts the C-major chord in first inversion, may be a significant factor. Given a verse tonic of C minor, the C major chord may be acting more as V/IV than a modally altered tonic. As a result, I hear this passage as a prechorus/chorus blend, which can be understood as resulting from a telescoping of song form that merges the prechorus and chorus roles into a single passage.

In some situations, the choice of which blend might be more appropriate is itself ambiguous. I find this to be the case with “Summer of ‘69” (Bryan Adams, 1984). The opening of the song ( Example 11a ) presents the listener with two discrete vocal sections. The first, in mm. 3–18, clearly acts as verse material. The second, in mm. 19–28, is open to interpretation however. In m. 29, the end of the second section overlaps into what seems to be four bars of link material, since there are no vocals from m. 29 until the entrance of the second verse. On this basis, we may judge mm. 19–28 to be the chorus of the song, since there is no vocal material that follows it. Indeed, the end of this second section contains a catchy refrain (“Those were the best days of my life”), which is highlighted by the stop-time texture. At the same time, the harmonic material in this second section has a searching quality, which may feel somewhat prechorus-like. We might as a result posit a prechorus/chorus blend here, if perhaps tilted towards the chorus role.",

As an additional complication, what had been the link material now spans eight bars of music with vocals that include the title of the song (mm. 51–58). Perhaps mm. 41–50 are thus the prechorus of the song, and mm. 51–58 are a chorus/link blend. It is undeniable that the stop-time refrain (mm. 49–50) is a high point in the song, but does this vocal phrase end the chorus or begin the chorus? The final iteration of main vocal material ( Example 11c ) clouds the question further, in that the lyrics in mm. 41–50 are repeated mostly verbatim. Overall, there is a strong feeling of a chorus in this song, but it is as if there are two types of choruses, one a prechorus/chorus blend, the other a chorus/link blend. Interpreting the telescoping of form in this song, therefore, it might be best to say that the chorus role has been dispersed over both neighboring section roles. “Where’s That Confounded Bridge?”",

In some songs, this ambiguity arises because the bridge role is only weakly expressed; in other songs, there may be a blend of section roles, or some combination of these two situations. One important factor in this regard is our association of the bridge role with a particular location in the song form, namely, before the last iteration of the large-scale A group, which is often just a final chorus. Related to this factor is the different hierarchical implications of the bridge role, whether at the level of verse and chorus or at the level of the large-scale AABA grouping.",

Since “I Don’t Wanna Cry” showed an ambiguity between prechorus and bridge that leaned more toward the bridge role, it is worth looking at a case that leans more toward the prechorus role. The song “Papa Don’t Preach” (Madonna, 1986) provides a good example in this regard. The initial prechorus ( Example 12a ) and the vocal material prior to the final choruses ( Example 12b ) match closely in melody, harmony, and instrumentation, with only small differences in the first six bars due to text setting. Given the choice between prechorus and bridge labels, therefore, it would seem more reasonable to refer to the vocal passage in Example 12b as another iteration of prechorus material. But the end of this final prechorus is significantly different than prior prechorus iterations, most notably in the avoidance of the F-minor tonic in the seventh bar, followed by a two-bar phrase extension on the strongest and clearest dominant sonority of the entire song. This reharmonization and phrase extension relate to the blending of some bridge quality into the prechorus material.",

For example, Stephenson analyzes the song “Wrapped Around Your Finger” (The Police, 1983) as a verse-chorus strophic form, i.e., a song that simply repeats blocks of verse and chorus material without any intervening bridge ( 2002 , 140). In his analysis, the song contains three blocks of verse-chorus material, the first starting around 0:30 in the original recording, the second around 2:05, and the third around 3:09, thus creating a large-scale AAA grouping pattern. For reference, Example 13a transcribes the first 16 bars of verse material in the song. Indeed, what Stephenson views as the third iteration of verse material ( Example 13b ) does present rather similar melodic content and phrase structure to prior iterations of verse material. But the music in Example 13b includes a number of significant differences from earlier verse sections. One obvious change involves the harmonic content: instead of the static toggling between A-minor and E-minor chords, a new bass line imparts a heightened sense of harmonic directionality. This bass line more strongly groups these measures in 8-bar units, since the minor tonic chord now appears only twice in the 16-bar passage. The melody also undergoes a subtle but important change. The strong sense of closure found at the end of every other vocal phrase in earlier verse sections is now absent. As a result, the feeling of instability and forward motion is further increased. The instrumentation also conveys a sense of drive, in that halfway through the 16 bars before the final chorus, the drums switch to the first standard rock beat of the entire song, while the electric guitar increases the tension with eighth-note repetitions of the pitch A. Furthermore, these features appear after two essentially identical iterations of verse and chorus material, at the exact moment where we would expect a bridge in the form of the song.  Overall, therefore, the material in Example 13b conveys a strong sense of bridge functionality if only blended into to the third iteration of verse material.",

The work by Endrinal ( 2008 , 2011 ) on the music of U2 is particularly relevant in this regard, as he deprecates the term “bridge” in favor of the term “interverse.” Endrinal feels that U2’s music includes many passages at the position in a song where we might expect a typical bridge, yet these passages often do not fully convey a clear bridge role. To Endrinal, the term “interverse” is a more neutral label, and he goes on to categorize types of interverses based on two parameters: whether these sections are tonally open (“continuous”) or closed (“sectional”), and whether they consist mostly of new material (“independent”) or recycle material from a previous section (“dependent”). Alternatively, these interverse subcategories can be conceptualized as different levels of bridge strength and role blending. For instance, an independent continuous interverse—new musical material that lacks tonal closure—would be a passage that presents relatively clear bridge quality, whereas an independent sectional interverse—new music material that is tonally closed—would be a passage in which bridge quality is comparatively weaker. A dependent interverse, whether continuous or sectional, would be a passage in which the bridge role is blended with some other section role. Example 14a .

Consider, for example, the song “Mysterious Ways” (U2, 1991). Endrinal’s interpretation of the song’s form as an overall compound AABA pattern is shown in Example 14a (a reproduction of Example 5 from his 2011 article). The independent continuous interverse, abbreviated “N” with an “i” superscript and “c” subscript, occurs exactly where we would expect a bridge: after two iterations of the larger “VTC” group (i.e., a verse-prechorus-chorus block) and immediately prior to the last chorus. Before I discuss this interverse, it will be useful for the reader to be familiar with the chorus material—especially the bass line, which plays an ostinato pattern centered on tonic despite the chord changes in the upper parts—as can be heard in Example 14b . The interverse, which can be heard in Example 14c , begins with new material and thus, at least initially, warrants categorization as an independent section. Many listeners may accordingly hear the beginning of what sounds like a bridge section at this point in the song. But a critical change occurs halfway into this interverse, where the tonally static bass line from the chorus re-enters four bars prior to what Endrinal identifies as the final chorus. Accordingly, this interverse is neither independent nor dependent, in that it both presents new material and recycles old material. Instead, it is a partial blend of bridge and chorus.",

As this demonstrates, bridge quality may combine with a variety of different section types, in large part because our perception of a bridge is associated with generic principles of contrast at a particular location in the song form. A consequent effect is that “bridge-ness” may seem to be stretched (or distributed) across a number of what may otherwise appear to be independent sections, whether or not the song includes a clear instance of a standalone bridge section. The song “Take Me Home Tonight” (Eddie Money, 1986) provides an excellent example of this situation. Example 15a transcribes the beginning of the first verse (mm. 13–16), the first chorus (mm. 35–42), and the following link material (mm. 43–46), all of which express clear instances of these section roles.

The intervening measures (mm. 69–86) encompass a number of separate sections. That said, a great deal of ambiguity and instability is palpable throughout this larger passage, which lends a general feeling that bridge quality spans across more than just a single section. The best candidate for a standalone bridge section is mm. 71–78, which elide the end of the second link. In m. 71, we hear a dramatic change in texture, accomplished in large part by the half-time feel in the drums and the introduction of the solo saxophone, neither of which have been heard in the song until this moment. The harmonic rhythm also slows down, stalling on the submediant, B ♭ minor. As the harmonies begin to gain momentum in m. 75, the lead vocal reappears. But the melodic and lyric content is drawn primarily from the end of the chorus, and so there seems to be a bridge/chorus blend at this point. Link material returns during mm. 79–82, although the textural changes introduced in m. 71 persist, at least somewhat. The bottom has now dropped out with the removal of the bass and guitar. Additionally, the drums—although no longer playing a half-time pattern—have not fully returned to the standard beat heard throughout the rest of the song; instead, the drums pay homage to the well known beat from “Be My Baby” (The Ronettes, 1963) via omission of the snare on beat 2. This drum pattern continues through the verse-like material in mm. 83–86. But while the verse seems to return in m. 83, it is something of a mirage. Features of mm. 83–86 harken back to the material in m. 71, including the reappearance of the saxophone as well as the persistent emphasis on B ♭ by the bass guitar. So while chorus, link, and verse material are all encountered in mm. 71–86, a variety of factors preclude any clear or stable instantiation of these section roles. Instead, there is a persistent bridge quality that seems to underlie and thwart any attempt at stability prior to the re-entrance of the chorus in m. 87. We might even feel that bridge quality extends further on some level, in that the triumphant return of the chorus in m. 87 is significantly undercut by the lack of drums and bass, which do not enter until the second phrase in m. 91. A full repetition of the chorus (m. 95) is almost demanded in that it is not until this point that we hear the chorus return in its full glory. Conclusion",

In the approach to form in pop/rock music I present here, I posit that it is often counterproductive to think of section roles as mutually exclusive labels. Indeed, the most appropriate way to represent many moments in pop/rock music often seems to be via a blend of section roles. To date, though, it is extremely uncommon for an analysis to provide imbricated or coincident section labels. Understandably, we want to represent the form of a song in the clearest possible manner.

In doing so, I do not mean to criticize these analyses; I think each analyst cited in this essay is responding to salient factors of form heard in the music. Instead, I argue for a multivalent approach to form in pop/rock music that encourages us to view the form of any given song as a response to shared conceptions of song form.

Since everyone interacts with and listens to a different body of music during their lifetime, one could argue that we have each developed highly personalized notions of what constitutes more or less representative examples of section labels. Consequently, no single shared understanding of prototypical situations can be said to exist. Someone who is an avid Michael Jackson fan, for example, may have an entirely different understanding of what constitutes a typical verse than someone who listens primarily to heavy metal. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that research in cognitive psychology shows that subjects overwhelmingly agree on judgments of those more central and clear members of a category, even if they disagree on the exact boundaries and details of those categories ( Rosch 1978 ). Nevertheless, different eras and styles of rock music undoubtedly utilize different strategies for organizing musical material. It is for this reason that I limited my examples to pop/rock music from 1982–1991, although even within this time frame, specific traits may associate with a particular section role more strongly in the music of one artist than in the music of another. For this reason, style analysis has been and will continue to be a valuable and worthwhile endeavor. In conclusion, this essay is meant not to act as a definitive guide to form in pop/rock music, even given the restrictions of the era under consideration. Rather, it is meant to exemplify a mindset that helps us better appreciate how songs continue to fascinate and enchant us given the confines of a highly limited palette of form and section types.",
