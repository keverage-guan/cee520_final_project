    "abstract": "This article proposes a typology of relations between the persona and its environment in recorded popular song, envisaged as the relationship between lyric/melody and accompaniment. It argues that the function of an accompaniment moves from simple pitch/meter orientation, through genre-setting and tone-setting, to support, amplification and explanation of the persona’s situation, and finally to contradiction with it.",

                "text": "[1] Some years ago, Simon Frith asked the very obvious question, \n“why do songs have words?” (1) (2) It seems to me that its obverse is equally \ndemanding of attention. Not actually “why do songs have music?,” for that is a \nlittle too abstract even for my taste, but the associated “why do songs have \naccompaniments?” Why, when singing, do people (both listeners and performers) \nwant or need the security to be gained from having that singing accompanied, \neither by themselves, or by an assortment of others? What does an accompaniment add ? The word “accompany” indicates being in the company of something else, \nwith an implied hierarchy of perceptual pertinence, although not necessarily of \nsignificance. What accompanies forms a key part of the environment for what is \naccompanied. Philip Tagg’s semiotic method reads this implied relationship \n(between what accompanies and what is accompanied) as the embodiment in music of \nthe relationship between an individual and its environment. (3) He observes the \nnormative underpinning by a melody-accompaniment dualism of all popular song, \ninsisting that this textural structure is “what Haydn and AC/DC share in \ncommon,” (4) and uses Jan Maróthy to argue that it is as pervasive a musical \nfeature as its visual equivalent, the figure/ground dualism of post-Renaissance \nEuropean painting. So, if accompaniment equates, at first approximation, to \nenvironment, then melody, in Tagg’s understanding, equates to persona. This term \nI actually derive from the writings of Edward T. Cone, particularly The \nComposer’s Voice , (5) but I shall depart from him in how I observe the persona \nto be constituted. Indeed, I depart also from Tagg in that for the analysis of \npopular song, it is less the melody which is subject to accompaniment, than the \nresult of the activity of singing—Tagg’s work concerns itself only little with \nlyrics. Eric Clarke’s adoption of a theory of subject position (6) does concern \nitself with lyrics, and also with accompaniment. He argues that for a song to \nimply a subject position, for it to encourage a listener to prefer one reading \nto others, it must be possible to distinguish analytically between what he terms \n“content” and “technique,” such that the “technique” narrows the \npossible interpretations a listener may make of the “content.” For Clarke, \n“content” refers particularly to the realm of the lyrics, while “technique” in \nprinciple refers to all other constitutive aspects of a song. Neither Clarke nor \nTagg use the term “persona”—Clarke prefers “subject,” (7) while Tagg uses \n“individual.” \nBoth of these, however, refer to an equivalent identity. I prefer the term \n“persona” for a number of reasons. Firstly, it reminds us that this identity is \nfictional (and, frequently, it is passive), a characteristic which is not \nbrought out by the competing terms. Secondly, it is on occasion multiple \n(particularly when we do not hear only a single voice). Beyond this, it is \nperhaps just a matter of taste.",

Both lyric, its manner of articulation, and its shaping melody \ncan conspire to create the persona, which is inhabited by the individual (or \nsometimes individuals) who sing to us. The environment within which (or against \nwhich) that persona operates is represented by the music which accompanies \nher/him, and which therefore includes three distinct elements: the textural matters normally considered under the heading “accompaniment”; the harmonic setting, including the modal/tonal vocabulary; the formal setting or narrative structure, i.e. the order in which its events \ntake place, and the patterns of repetition within this order. Because of its manifestation in sound, we might properly identify this as the personic environment. And, to complicate matters further, because as individuals we are \nalways part of the environment against which we view others, on occasion the \nmelody can, in theory at least, be argued to operate as if it were part of the \nenvironment rather than the persona. At root, then, this article proposes a \ntypology for the relationships enacted in song between a persona and its \nenvironment, a typology of what an accompaniment may add to a melodic \nline, which it will illustrate through numerous, varied, examples to demonstrate \nnot only the ubiquity of the relational positions I identify, but also the way \nthat each one is nuanced through its presence in an actual track.

Let me dispose of some of the latter \nstraight away. The need to orient oneself in terms of precise meter and stable \npitch is endemic to anglophone popular musics and, probably, to most European\npopular music. I am not convinced that the ability to retain meter and pitch is \nnormative even amongst highly respected interpreters. Producer Bernard Krause \nwrote of singer Patrice Holloway: “So perfect was her pitch [on an unaccompanied \ntrack] that Paul [Beaver] was able to lay a piano track . . . some weeks later \nwithout altering the speed of the tape to change the pitch.” (9) There would\n have been no need to make such a point were this a more widely exercised skill. \nIt therefore seems to me that we can cite the provision of a stable metrical and \nharmonic backdrop as simultaneously the most necessary, most basic, and least \ninteresting, purpose of an accompaniment. Whatever else it does, it is almost \ncertain to function in this way. Some accompaniments do no more. Example 1 . Patsy Cline, “I’m blue again” (click to enlarge)",

Accompaniments \nfrequently set the genre of a song, laying out the normative environmental \nconditions, together \nwith all the expectation-related baggage that a theory of genre carries. (10) Thus an adult-oriented rock song, a country song, a punk song, an R’n’B song, \nare in large part defined by the instrumentation and sound-sources used to  accompany the singer and, in some cases, the style of performance associated \nwith those instruments individually or collectively. I am highlighting here a \ncrucial distinction between accompaniments which signify only at the level of style , and those which signify at the more particularized level of the \nindividual song . Examples of the former are legion—I shall refer to Patsy\n Cline’s “I’m blue again” for its clarity. (11) The song is in 32-bar form, in 8 12 . In the first half of the verse, the kit and piano have a regular triplet \npattern, which is broken for bars 17–24. [See Example 1 ]. There seems to be no \nparticularized expressive content in either this basic groove, or in the change\n of articulation at that point. It simply marks a formal break, the shift to the \nmiddle 8 section. In saying it has no expressive role, I mean simply that these \nelements could perfectly well be transferred to another song performed by Patsy \nCline within the same style—and indeed they are. (12) So, in this example, the \nrole of the accompanimental environment is simply to situate this song in terms \nof chronology and genre as an example of immediately post-rock’n’roll country \nmusic. Indeed, this also seems to be how accompaniments function for the vast \nmajority of solo folk revival singers. The way Martin Carthy attacks the Breton \npipe tune “Ar Ch’akouz,” which he uses to carry lyrics based on the \nseventeenth-century song “The dominion of the sword,” (13) and the accompaniment \nhe gives it, makes musical sense, and expresses his strength of feeling at the \nissues the lyrics address, but contributes not a whit to an interpretation of \nthe song. Indeed, beside the vehemence in his voice, the guitar’s role is \nrelegated to one of setting meter and pitch, identifying genre, and providing an \nimage of immovability, in the multiple drone.",

We begin to \napproach that realm where some attention to the detail of the personic \nenvironment is necessary in order to apprehend the expressive richness of the \nvirtual performances of particular personae. Here we have the received view of \nthe role of an accompaniment, which is to conform to the ostensible meaning of \nthe lyrics and, in doing so, to support, or perhaps illustrate, the meaning of \nthe song. Forms of word-painting are the most obvious devices here, but within \npopular music, we must be wary of seeking the sort of notationally-based \nword-painting techniques familiar from notated music. In a recorded genre, \nword-painting works by reference to the sounds heard, not to their visual \nrepresentation. Iggy Pop’s recent song “Whatever” (23) exemplifies this clearly. \nThe song originates on a lacklustre album, and is ironic in its consistent \nrecourse to the kind of adolescent disdain indicated by the title (Iggy Pop was \nborn in 1947). The stylistically conventional overdriven guitar which forms part \nof the accompaniment simply drops from the texture on the words “her voice just \nfades away.” It is not a true fade, but the parallel is strong enough—by \ndropping away, the texture literally illustrates the content of, actually \nenergizes, the lyric. Indeed, the very obviousness of the device adds to the \nrather tongue-in-cheek subject position the song adopts. An analogous, although \nnot ironic, situation can be found in Joe Cocker’s cover of “With a little help \nfrom my friends.” (24) As in the Beatles’ original, the backing voices change \nposition during the song from being simply respondents, to actively questioning \nthe persona’s need for reassurance from others. But, deviating from the \noriginal, in the second bridge (at about 3’46”), the support these “friends” \noffer becomes so psychologically strong that Cocker no longer needs to sing the \nlyrics his listeners would have known from the Beatles’ version. The “help” \noffered by the accompanimental, female, singers here becomes palpable. The key \nfeature of the environment in which Cocker is singing is formed by these \nconfidantes. A similar degree of accompanimental support is offered to John \nLennon’s “Imagine” (25) by the production qualities particularly of Lennon’s \naccompanying piano. Here, the sonically unfocused quality of the production of \nthe instrument’s sound supports a similar fuzziness in the singer’s ideology, \nwhich has contributed to the debates about both the degree of realism, and the \nself-delusion, which may surround Lennon’s song. (26) This quality is enhanced by \nthe observation that the melodic line first achieves a measure of \nharmonically-supported closure on the word “dreamer.” And we don’t have to wait \nfor the rise of rock to find such examples. Nat King Cole’s performances of \n“When I fall in love” (27) spend most of their course promising how he will \nbehave when that eventuality comes about. Unexceptionally, the song matches \nturns to the minor with recollections of sadness but, at the last, as his \nfalling in love becomes directed (“when I fall in love . . . with you”), the final \n“you” is marked by an unexpected chromaticism. Here, it is not the \naccompanimental textures, but the harmonic environment, which supports the \nlyric.",

The \nlack of final closure embodied in Janis Joplin’s live performance of “Ball and \nchain” (29) serves to prevent the listener from treating the performance as \nsimply a performance of the song. Here, the accompanying musicians vanish (in \nthe actual performance, they most likely left the stage) while Joplin delivers \nan extempore solo but, in a departure from contemporary practice, they fail to \nreturn to round off the song. This solo serves to enact the lyrics by blurring \nthe boundary between a (fictionalized) performance and a diatribe on the nature \nof contemporary society. In Sonny and Cher’s love song “I got you babe,” (30) the \n“us against the world” position which the lyrics promote is maintained musically \nby a monotone 5 ˆ over I–IV–I—the sense is of maintaining the melodic pitch \n(and thus their stance) “in spite of” the shift to a dissonant IV. After a \nseries of verses/choruses (none of which comes to rest on I), a final playout \ncontinues, before fading, over a I–IV–I–V–(I–IV–I–V . . . ) pattern. This is the \nfirst time in the song that I is approached directly from a strong V, rather \nthan from IV or an imperfect cadence. And, for the first time, the emphasis in \nthe relationship changes, from “I got you ” to “ I got you.” This change, \nformally specific, is thus enacted in the harmony. A more complex example \nappears in Ashford & Simpson’s “Ain’t no mountain high enough,” as sung by Diana \nRoss. (31) The track opens with a wordless chorus, an entreating verse (“if you \nneed me . . . ”) and a second chorus. We continue with what sounds like a bridge, \nmarked by an ascending bass (a topic indicating “reaching”) which leads to a \nclimax at which point the singer gives her lover what she insists is her \nguarantee that she will always be there. We return to the chorus. Having a \nsingle verse, and a bridge which marks a change of relational position, is \nhighly unusual. The transgressive nature of the form, marked by the chromatic \nbass, thus supports the lyrics. These examples, in moving from uncertainty to \ncertainty, also flout the norm whereby most popular songs explore a static \nposition. Analogously, Cilla Black’s singing of the Bacharach/David classic “Alfie” (32) subverts expectations of the form of the song. In the first two verses, the \nsinger is bemused by her lover “Alfie” (she always stresses the \nfirst syllable of the name) who holds it “wise to be cruel.” At the beginning of \nthe third verse, after a bridge which threatens to challenge the harmonic world \nof the opening, her enquiries become an assertion: “I believe in love.” A \nchromatic bass then moves us into a formally new area, where she insists that \n“without true love we just exist, Alfie,” stressing for the first time the \nlast syllable of his name. This alteration marks a change in her emotional \nposition—her self-discovery coincides with both a shift in harmonic language \nand transgression of normal formal practice—in this way harmony and form work \ntogether to mark her moment of self-awareness.",

The issue of ambiguity is problematic because, with many \nsongs, ambiguity is only the result of unfamiliarity with idiom, and is thus  dependent on the nature of listeners’ competence. Traffic’s \n“Hole in my \nshoe,” (37) though, provides a case which may be more universally valid. It \ncauses trouble to anyone who simply tries to interpret the lyrics at face value—“an elephant’s eye was looking at me from a bubblegum tree” for instance. \n The accompanimental texture, however, situates the song very clearly within the \npsychedelic movement, indicating that the lyrics are not to be taken at face \nvalue, that the environment is not a realist one. Thus the “100 tin soldiers” do \nnot literally “stand at my shoulder.” Indeed, the prominent psychedelic \ncoding (38) may even imply that the texture, rather than the lyric itself, may be \nthe prime carrier of meaning. This coding is provided primarily by \ninstrumentation (sitar, flute, mellotron) and production techniques (slow chord \nbending, reverse recording, phasing). Thus we are reassured that the song’s \nambiguity is inherent, and is not a feature of our possible lack of competence. \nIn this way its meaning is clarified.",

The singer sings of being in receipt of “good \nvibrations,” over a pattern which moves upward, from G, to A, to B in readiness \nfor the second verse. The vector is clear—upward motion, and activity in the \nrelationship by his partner, towards him. In the centre of the song, the texture \nslims remarkably, down to organ and shakers, over which the singer begins to \nrecognize his culpability—he’s “gotta keep those . . . vibrations happening with \nher,” i.e. become active himself. Thereafter, the  “good vibrations” hook is sung over the same pattern, but now in reverse motion, \nfrom B, to A, to G.

                "text": "[16] I wrote at the outset that harmonic setting can be vital in its \nrepresentation of the environment. How, though, to read this? The cornerstone of \nmy understanding equates achievement of I with closure in some sense, and \nfailure to achieve it with lack of closure, modified as necessary by metrical \nplacing. The other key characteristic is the observation that as a mode \nincreases the number of minor intervals above the tonic (as we move from Lydian \nthrough to Locrian), the greater the degree of negative emotional quality \ninvested in the environment. This hermeneutic construct is yet to be empirically \ntested. Deep Purple’s “Child in Time” (42) is one of a body of songs reliant for \nits effect on the Aeolian cadence. This is the cadential pattern moving VI–VII–i \n(i.e. F–G–Am in a Aeolian). This cadence (43) in rock is, more often than not, \nassociated with achievement in the face of high odds, what I call its \n“nonetheless” quality. This is the realm of its signification. The underlying \npattern to “Child in Time” is formed of i–VII–i; VI–VII; VII–i. The impending, \nand ultimately realized, disaster apparent in the lyrics is matched by this \nconstant reiteration, demonstrating an undesired actualization of the inevitable\n outcome. This sense of the inevitability of an unwanted outcome is crucial to \nunderstanding the Coverdale Page track “Take me for a little while.” (44) The \nverse begins by decorating harmonies of E, moves to a pattern dominated by Am, \nbut then sinks back. A short pre-chorus reiterates the importance of Am, such \nthat the chorus takes up the sequence Am–F–G–G. Failure to resolve to chord I, \nin this example to resolve to Am at the end of the Am–F–G–G pattern, implies the \nsubversion of an inevitable outcome. Now the subject matter of the song’s lyric \nconcerns the inevitability of failure—at the crucial moment, the singer tells \nhis lover to take him just “for a little while.” Their relationship cannot \nremain stable, because he’s “growing older.” The harmony, in other words,\n indicates that “taking him for a little while” is an attempt to subvert the \ninevitable, i.e. the inevitability of failure, a failure—his demise—which \nwill come about once the final chord I is reached and closure is achieved. For \nthis reason, the track fades without that happening. The Darkness track “Holding \nmy own” (45) uses the same pattern to energize an avoidance of the inevitable. It \nis less marked: the parallel Am–G–F–G chord sequence accompanies the song’s \ntitle, asserting that the persona is “holding his own” in the face of enormous \nodds; because it is less marked, the sequence functions harmonically as Ionian \nvi–V–IV–V rather than Aeolian i–VII–VI–VII. The realm of its signification is \nnonetheless the same. Example 3a . Vanessa Carlton, “Ordinary Day” (click to enlarge) Example 3b .

This is a constant state, one of being \nunable to achieve satisfaction, to achieve closure. Musically, closure is \nunattainable here because the constant repeated sequence of the open-ended  verse is simply a \nMixolydian I–IV– the I is so familiar that the closure \notherwise attendant on achieving it, is impossible here. The melody, too, is \ninsistent upon its reiterated tonics. No wonder he can’t get no satisfaction—he has nowhere else to go. From a very different genre, Vanessa Carlton’s  \n“Ordinary Day” (47) uses harmony and texture to explain the lyric. The song \nconcerns an encounter with first love, energized from the outset by Carlton’s \nbreathy delivery and an insecure bass which consistently sounds the tonic third \nrather than the root, providing a picture of (pleasant) insecurity or \nanticipation. [See Example 3a ] After two verses, at 1’46“, the imaginary \n”ordinary boy“ is providing security (she’s ”in the palm of your hand“) as the \ntonic achieves its root [ Example 3b ]. To mark this coming together, at 2’1”, the \ntwo independent parts move in both rhythmic and partial melodic unison [ Example 3c ]. \nSubsequently she comes out of what was “just a dream” and we move back to \nseparation and insecurity marked by absence of the harmonic root. However, as \nshe recalls the experience out of the dream world, at 3’20”, she recovers her \nsecurity. The song thus provides a model of a girl overcoming insecurity through \nlearning to trust a “significant other,” dramatized by the difference between \n“dream” and “reality” and the transfer of something understood while in the \n“dream” state into reality. This model cannot be inferred form the lyrics alone, \nbut requires close attention to both the texture and harmonies of her \naccompaniment.",

Translating into the terms \nI am using in this article, he suggests that certain songs, through the detail \nof their environments, limit the potential range of listener responses to the \nissues presented by the persona. Provided we go no further than “limit,” and not \nas far as “prescribe,” I find this a pretty persuasive argument. He notably \nfocuses on P.J.Harvey and John Parish’s “Taut,” (48) a song which, he argues, \n“draws the listener in to a close identification with the singer and \nprotagonist, a rather direct confrontation with that potent mixture of \ninfatuation and terrified submission that can turn people into victims.” (49) He \ndemonstrates this most particularly through close attention to the song’s \nintroduction, its combination of particular sounds, their predictability and \ntheir connotations, and the way these set up the lyric. In other words, the  introduction indicates how we might experience the lyric, once it arrives. \nHowever, that said, I would argue that a subject position can become possible \neven without explicit understanding of the “content,” the lyric. Take the Tri Yann \nsong “Je m’en vas,” (50) “I set off.” The melody to this track is borrowed \nfrom the old folk song “The leaving of Liverpool.” In the hands of revivalist \ngroups like the Dubliners or the Spinners, this is a very ordinary song. (51) And \nTri Yann’s version starts very much in that vein, as if performed by an \nunsophisticated musician. We are encouraged to hear it as an inconsequential, \nanachronistic, amateur performance. But the textural growth which maps the \ntrack’s narrative, the staged addition of tight rhythm section, overdriven \nguitar and prominent pipes, totally changes it for a Celticist audience, at \nleast. This developing texture implies a sense of determination wholly missing \nfrom older performances, although both the original song, and Tri Yann’s, are \nabout leaving on a long journey. Thus Tri Yann envelop us in the journey.",

She is simply pleading for the \ncontinuance of a relationship. She needs to deliver the lyrics with such force, \nthough, that we might be moved to ask whether such a continuation is in her own \nbest interests. She points out in the song that she has always been around for “him,” she has proved her devotion, which she now desperately implores him to \nreciprocate. The key moment occurs in the chorus, with the way the accompaniment \noperates. The 8 12 feel, with pronounced upbeat, seems to push the song forward \nrather roughly. The rallentando of the previous bar is very localized, and the \nchorus picks up with quite a lilt. The difference between this feel, and that of \nthe comparable portion of Bette Midler’s later, live performance, is \nstriking. (52) Midler is performing even further over the top than did Ellison. \nThe accompaniment then drags Midler’s “cries,” giving her space to fully indulge \nherself. In the chorus, in opposition to Ellison’s version, the accompaniment \n(most particularly the bass and kit) provides constant movement throughout the \nsecond half of the bar, a feel which is much closer to 8 6 that 8 12 . This seems \nto support her plea for the continuation of a static situation [compare Examples 4a \nand 4b ]. In Bette Midler’s performance, then, the music is not pushed forward. \nIt seems to me that for Lorraine Ellison, the accompanimental environment, which \nis acting as her confidante, is saying “move to the future,” which will be a \nbetter situation for her, since staying with “him” will result in a difficult \nrelationship. For Bette Midler, again acting as her confidante, the \naccompaniment, in indulging her, is saying “stay with it,” “stay with him,” “stay with the situation,” oblivious to the difficulties which a good confidante \nshould foresee.",

Indeed, it implies different readings of different \nperformances, confirmation that the signification of a song cannot lie in the \nsong, but must lie in the way the performance is received. Moreover, it is \ninformation which the singer is probably only party to if she is sufficiently \naware (we can only guess whether the “Lorraine Ellison” persona will actually \nheed the accompaniment’s advice). An analogy I have in mind here is that of the \neveryday understanding of “body language.” When watching others speak, we can \ntell how committed they are to what they are saying, we can tell whether to risk \ntrusting in them, by how they express themselves, how they accompany their words \nwith posture and gesture. Simon Frith has argued that even without visual clues, \nwe can discern whether to trust singers by listening to the non-singing sounds \nthey make: “Pop songs celebrate not the articulate but the inarticulate, and the \nevaluation of pop singers depends not on words but on sounds—on the noises \naround the words. In daily life, the most directly intense statements of feeling \ninvolve just such noises: people gasp, moan, laugh, cry . . . people distrust the \nsilver-tongued, the seducers, politicians, salesmen, who’ve got the gift of the \ngab. Inarticulateness, not poetry, is the popular songwriter’s conventional sign \nof sincerity.” (53) I would argue that this discernment stretches not just to the \ninarticulate sound singers make, but to the non-articulating sounds which go to \nmake up a performance, i.e. the sounds of accompanying instruments. A very \ndifferent example of the same process, of the “reality” of a situation being \navailable to the perception of an audience but not to the persona, is given by \nthe Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ USA.” (54) This is an example of a different order, \nsince the song is based, both harmonically and melodically, on Chuck Berry’s \n“Sweet little sixteen.” (55) There is little doubt that, when writing the Beach\n Boys’ song, Brian Wilson was aware of the similarity (the song is nowadays \ncredited to “C.Berry/B.Wilson”) but the change of location, and the brash \ninnocence in which it is sung, imply that the Beach Boys personae are unaware of \na link contemporary listeners inevitably made.",

This example is by no means alone. Andy Stewart’s self-penned “Donald, where’s your troosers?” (57) is normally taken as a piece of nostalgic \nwhimsy. The song sets up three positions, those of the Scottish yokel (who \nalways wears a kilt), of polite (Edinburgh?) society, and (more hidden) of the \n(BBC) establishment of which Stewart was himself a part. Polite society is \nlampooned, and the yokel seems to come off best. However, the expressed distaste \nof rock’n’roll (the recording of the song itself contains a delightful pastiche \nof Elvis Presley singing it) is voiced on the part of the establishment. The \nsong is harmonically accompanied by a “double tonic” (i.e. Aeolian i–VII) \npattern, which sounds authentically “Scottish.” However, the end of each verse \nreplaces the “expected” VII–i cadence with the V–i of the concert hall—a \nsubtle, but nonetheless forceful, trouncing of the Scottish vernacular with that \nof high culture. The harmonic environment, then, if we can hear it, tells us not \nto take the lyrics at face value. In the Boomtown Rats’ “I never loved Eva \nBraun,” (58) the protagonist is more obviously culpable. He (who can only be \nidentified as Adolf Hitler) brazenly declares that he wasn’t responsible for the\n results of his actions, but the breakdown and nonchalant whistling (of the sort \nyou might have indulged in as a kid, hands behind your back, head in the air as \nyour misdemeanor is discovered—Who? Me?) (59) which precede the final chorus \n(at c.3’15”) give the lie to that. And there are other types of example too. The \nposition set up by the Sex Pistols’ “Holidays in the Sun” (60) is also not to be\n believed. Here is a song which purports to anarchism, a line totally belied by \nits formulaic rhythmic, harmonic, and articulative approach. (61) A final example \nis rather bizarre but, I think, particularly informative. I refer to a \nre-recording by ‘60s balladeers the Bachelors of the Hollies’ 1969 hit “He ain’t\n heavy.” (62) This is a song which wears it’s heart on its sleeve, inspired by a \nline from the 1938 film Boys Town , symbolizing comradeship among vagrant boys, \nand supposedly based on reality. It is a difficult song to bring off, requiring \ngrandeur without pomposity, compassion without sentimentality. This Bachelors’ \nrecent version aims for a big ending, presumably demonstrating the care the \nsinger promises, and his disdain for the cost entailed. In order to bring it \noff, however, the drummer hopelessly miscalculates his cadential flurry in a \nrhetorical display empty of content. There may be a risk of overstating the case \nout of context, so a comparison is in order. In Grandaddy’s “Hewlett’s  Daughter,” we can hear the same sort of over-blown, contextually inappropriate \ndrum intervention. However, because this occurs at the end of the bridge between \nverses, “out of the blue,” rather than at the end of the song, its \ninappropriateness seems intentional. It seems to be in the service of the anger \nthat is just below the surface of the singer’s declaration that he “should have \nbeen your son.” (63) There is no equivalent inappropriateness of position within \nthe form of the song in the Bachelors’ case.",

Cook argues that two \nconcurrent media can inhabit one of three relationships: conformity, \ncomplementation, and contest. In the recent examples, above, the views given by \nthe two textural strands (persona/melody and environment/accompaniment) contest \neach other, and in such cases I think we are always more likely to trust the \nlatter.

This is in the distance, and the words \ncannot be made out, and yet by the fact that they are words, they call for our \nattention. A more common case occurs where a vocal line gets taken over by part \nof the accompaniment. This is common in examples of “call and response” textures \nas they develop from African-American genres. (68) It also happens in mainstream \nrock and pop, as in Wishbone Ash’s “Throw down the sword,” (69) where a \nbifurcated melody leads into a two-part guitar line. Indeed, perhaps this is  potentially what always happens when a solo enters: if we read this solo as a \ncontinuation of the vocal melody, at the point of interchange, the expression \ncan be seen as becoming more eloquent, as it moves beyond words. The Carpenters’ \n“Goodbye to love” (70) exemplifies this more overtly, as the guitar solo actually picks up Karen \nCarpenter’s phrasing and literally takes her expression up to new heights [See Example 6 ]. Notwithstanding the fact that Carpenters fans disliked the \nintrusion of the guitar as stylistically foreign, (71) this reading is certainly \navailable to non-fans. There seems to me a clear difference between this sort of \ncase, where a melody line moves to an instrument for a solo, and the sharing of \nmaterial between two forces, simply because in this former case, the melody is \nfirmly identified with the persona before the instrument ever gets near it.",

                "text": "[26] Finally, an obvious question which I have left till last. Is it right to \ncall all the non-melodic parts of a texture “accompaniment”? In other words, is \nTagg’s assumption of a melody/accompaniment dualism sufficient? This is actually \ntoo large a (new) question for me to more than broach here, but some coverage is \nnecessary. As an assumption, it appears a reasonable one, but there is certainly \none significant repertoire where it falls down. This repertoire is formed by \ninstances where, along with a band, the persona of the singer self-accompanies \nhim- or herself on a guitar (self-accompaniment on a keyboard is a different \nissue, I believe). On Lindisfarne’s “Good to be here,” (72) we simply hear singer \nAlan Hull, an acoustic guitar (which Hull plays), and an orchestra. The \norchestra forms an accompanimental environment which really only supports the \npersona from the outset, reacting expressively at the “right” points. The guitar \nis sounded in conjunction with the orchestra, such that its role seems to be \naccompanimental. However, at the moment at which the singer becomes no longer \nseparated from what he’s describing, the moment when he wakes from what we come \nto realize is a dream of a ghostly nature, when he comes to describe his wife\n addressing him in bed, the guitar drops from the texture. It is away only \nmomentarily, but its absence clearly marks that moment of change. If only at \nthis point, the guitar function is clearly separate from that of the remainder \nof the accompaniment, which does not mark this moment. This usage develops from \nthe singer/songwriter genre, and was taken up by heavy rock in the late \n1960s/early 1970s where the guitar, when pitted against the rest of the \naccompaniment, represents the individual battling against some sort of societal \nnorm, or a body of undifferentiated “others.” (73) As this example demonstrates, \nin this repertoire, the guitar might more usefully be read as part of the \npersona.",

                "text": "[27] So, it seems to me that the function of accompaniments is far from unitary, \nas their textures, harmonies and forms create environments within which a \npersona acts. I have isolated seven stages on a continuum, from simple \npitch/meter orientation, through genre-setting and tone-setting, to support, \namplification and explanation of the persona’s situation, and finally to \ncontradiction, by analogy with body language. Along this continuum, the \naccompaniment represents an environment which is at first simply inert, in later \nstages is quiescent, becomes active, and finally oppositional. I have then \nidentified three problematic issues in the simple assumption of a \nmelody/accompaniment dualism: that of complementation; that of the wordless \nmelody; and the non-unitary nature of some accompaniments. And I do not pretend \nthat this list is exhaustive, or even that these are the only points to mark on \nthe continuum. What I hope I have demonstrated, however, is that not only is a\n reduction of the operative sphere of meaning of a song to that of its lyrics \ninadequate, but that the same goes for a reduction of such a sphere to that of \nits lyrics and how they are sung. Even without consideration of production \nmanipulation, concentration on that very rich amalgam which constitutes the \ntrack’s personic environment is absolutely crucial if we are to fully experience \nthe expressive richness of popular song.",
