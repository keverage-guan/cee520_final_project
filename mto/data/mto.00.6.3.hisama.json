Positive signs can be seen in conference programming, publications, and job opportunities. I suggest that the field of music theory presents encouraging possibilities in the new millennium for those who want to build a professional life outside the canon.",

                "text": "[1] The invitation I received last fall to participate in this millennial panel requested that I address the topic of\nhow “music\ntheory goes outside the canon.” Although I had never considered myself a specialist in this emerging area of research, I am happy\nto be associated with it because I believe music theory’s current vibrancy can be attributed to our profession’s welcoming of a\ndiversity of thinking about topics of study and methods of analysis, a trend that I hope will become a fixture\nin the new millennium. [ 2 ] Because the six papers delivered at the 1997 SMT special session “Music Theory: Practices and Prospects” (two of which\nwere given by my plenary session colleague Patrick McCreless and our session chair Janet\nSchmalfeldt) reflected upon directions\nmusic theory has taken over the past decade and were subsequently published in Music Theory\nOnline , my contribution to today’s collective gaze into music theory’s future will begin by\nsurveying its very recent past—since 1997—as marked by its analytical ventures outside the\ncanon. (1) After assessing music theory’s present\nattitude toward non-canonical music, I\nwill argue that the profession has demonstrated a real interest in scholarship that tackles topics previously marginalized or absent\naltogether in the music-theoretical literature. This professional encouragement can be measured by conference program committees’\nacceptance of papers and panels that explore new topics and offer fresh approaches; publishers’ and editors’ active pursuit of\nwritings that expand the analytical canon; and an interest by search committees in candidates who can teach in areas outside of\nthe Western European art music canon as well as the standard tonal and post-tonal repertoire.\nUsing a single case study, I will suggest that the field of music theory presents encouraging\npossibilities for those who wish to build a professional life outside the canon.",

                "text": "[3] The appended bibliography represents the remarkable diversity of the methods and musics engaged by theorists over the past\nthree years and includes conference papers, articles, and books on topics as eclectic as bebop, soul, pop, rock, music by women,\nAmerican music,\nand music of Africa, Bali, and Java. These writings have introduced new possibilities for understanding a rich assortment\nof music. To highlight a few examples: Susan Fast explores how gender and sexuality are\nrepresented in the music and visual iconography of Led Zeppelin; Shaugn O’Donnell considers musical\nmetaphors in relation to the Grateful Dead; and David Temperley examines syncopation in examples by the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac,\nMarvin Gaye, Spin Doctors, and Pearl Jam within a theory of meter. Thanks\nto SMT’s embracing of new perspectives, facilitated by the efforts of its past presidents including\nJanet, Pat, and Joe Straus, the Society has nurtured work in pop and jazz, and interdisciplinary work in feminist theory, gender\nstudies, philosophy, cognition, and critical theory. An astounding five panels at the 1999\nSMT meeting were devoted exclusively to topics organized by so-called “special interest\ngroups”— Gamelan Theories, Western Theories , organized by the SMT Committee on Diversity; a special session on Italian feminist\ntheory organized by the SMT’s Committee on the Status of Women; Music Theory and\nQueer Issues , organized by the newly minted SMT Gay and Lesbian Discussion Group; Timbre and Technology in\nRock and Rap , organized by the equally new SMT Popular Music Group; and Ellington: The First One Hundred\nYears , organized by\nthe SMT Jazz Theory and Analysis Group. Papers in general sessions also contributed to this healthy opening up of the\ncanon—keynote addresses by Willie Anku on rhythm in African music and by Jose Luis\nMartinez on art music of India, Karim Al-Zand’s paper on improvisation in Cannonball Adderley’s “Straight,\nNo Chaser,” Robert Morris’s examination of variation and process in south Indian music, Walter Everett’s study of harmony in the\nmusic of Steely Dan, and Timothy Koozin’s investigation of structural and thematic aspects of Sarah McLachlan’s\nmusic. Publications will, I trust, eventually blossom from these initial\nconference offerings. The music theory community should be rightly proud of the stimulating array of topics and\nmethodologies spun out in Atlanta. [ 4 ] While this overview of recent scholarship presented at conferences and published in books confirmed my sense of music\ntheory’s increasing inclusivity, it also showed that the canon dominates one significant body of writings: music theory\njournals. A survey of articles published since 1997 in Music Theory Spectrum , Journal of Music Theory , Music Analysis , Perspectives of New\nMusic , Music Theory Online , Intégral , and Indiana Theory\nReview turned up many studies of works by canonical composers: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, J. S. and C. P. E.\nBach, Haydn, Mozart, Berg, Schumann, Boulez, Ligeti, Messiaen, Wagner, Brahms, Liszt, Beethoven, Debussy,\nBruckner, Janácek,\nProkofiev, Bartók, Schubert, and Webern. Eric F. Clarke’s article in a recent issue of Music Analysis is unusual on three counts: it discusses popular music, music by the\ndifficult-to-pigeonhole composer Frank Zappa, and music by a woman, P. J.\nHarvey. (2) Not only is there still a pressing need\nin the new millennium for our music theory societies to diversify their membership\nwith regard to gender and race, but music theory journals also need to publish scholarship on music by women,\npopular music and jazz, American music, and non-Western music on a much larger scale. I am not suggesting that research on\ncanonical composers should be dispensed with; I am saying that music theory journals need to become more diverse. When included in\nsuch journals, research outside the canon of Western European art music is legitimized as serious and\nnecessary scholarly work, and can lead to recognition in the form of awards by our professional\nsocieties, which in turn helps younger and independent scholars get a boost on the job market and eventually to gain tenure. As\nthe editor of an academic newsletter, (3) I am only too well aware\nof the difficulty in securing such contributions—good work has often been promised to another editor, the work is not ready to\nbe published, and so forth—but to say it simply, and to say it again: we must and can do better.",

                "text": "[6] In writing a book on the twentieth-century American women composers Ruth Crawford, Marion Bauer, and Miriam Gideon, I\nwanted to develop a branch of music theory that is markedly feminist; this impulse led me to consider elements not typically\nembedded within the fabric of music analysis. (4) Situating\ncompositions within their historical, political, and social contexts, Gendering Musical\nModernism presents close readings that recognize the impact of the composer’s gender, politics, and\nsocial views on the music itself; relates pieces to specific incidents in the composer’s life that occurred at roughly the\ntime of composition; and links narratives in the pieces to the composer’s identity as projected in her writings and in\nreflections by her contemporaries. My analyses of Crawford’s String Quartet, movements 3 and 4, Bauer’s Toccata for piano,\nGideon’s song “Night Is My Sister” for voice and string trio and her duo for violin\nand piano entitled “Esther” map out a relationship between musical structure and gender-specific events\nthat recognizes and critically comments upon the inequity of the sexes as experienced by these women. My analyses of Crawford’s\nsong, “Chinaman, Laundryman,” and Bauer’s Chromaticon for piano examine how aspects of identity including the composers’\npolitical beliefs and social views may likewise be inscribed in compositional structures. My analyses,\nmoreover, do not speak with a disembodied authority; they depart from music theory’s\ntraditionally objective stance and are marked by my own identity.",

Building upon the work of scholars who have brought critical questions about gender,\nrace, and sexuality to bear on popular music studies, I examine a variety of works from the past three decades with particular\nattention to the ways in which cultural politics have been absorbed into popular music, to structural\naspects of individual musical works in relation to their social and cultural contexts,\nand to the effects within a larger cultural economy of musical representations on both their intended audiences and those they\nrepresent. One example is my recently published study of a musician whose work I’ve admired for nearly\ntwenty years, the British singer and songwriter Joan Armatrading. (5) I argue that\nArmatrading’s songs convey a female experience as it has been shaped by her own identity, including her gender, race, and\nsexuality; and that her identity, frequently conveyed in encoded forms, can be uncovered through close readings of\nboth the musical structure of her songs and their lyrics.",

When faced with hundreds of applicants, many of whom seem\nto be perfectly qualified for the position, a search committee may very well be attracted to those\ncandidates who explore non-traditional repertories in imaginative ways. There are, of\ncourse, those people who will not have heard of a composer or group or genre to which you have devoted years of study, and who\nmay consequently dismiss your research as unimportant. But I am pleased to report that many in my\ngeneration have secured satisfying jobs in which their research is valued, or obtain\ntheir first job by working in more traditionally accepted areas and then turn to alternative genres as post-dissertation\nprojects.",

I believe that it is crucial that those people who\ncan have an impact on what is published and who is hired advocate work that presents innovative perspectives. Music theorists who\nproduce cutting-edge work on lesser known or marginalized repertories must receive our support, encouragement, and\nrecognition, before we lose an entire generation of scholars to the vagaries of the\nacademic job market.

But I am\nstill more interested in analyzing the rich body of music that remains\nuntheorized. By virtue of the increased interest in and tentative acceptance of feminist methodologies and popular music\ntopics in our field, I’m fortunate to have the freedom to work on music outside the analytical canon without feeling obligated to\nwrite on more traditional topics. I hope that in the coming millennium we will continue to branch out by drawing upon\ninsights from feminist theory, cultural studies, critical theory, ethnic, gender,\nand sexuality studies, postcolonial theory, and diaspora studies to invent subfields in music theory that we\nhaven’t yet imagined. As my own experience suggests, it is possible to forge a professional life in music theory through\nalternative approaches and repertories—reason enough, I think, to walk on the wild\nside.
