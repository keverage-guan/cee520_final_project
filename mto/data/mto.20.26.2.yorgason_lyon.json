    "abstract": "Max Steiner’s fanfare for Warner Brothers (WB), which was used to introduce most of the studio’s films during the years 1938–1955, is unique in that is does not have a clearly defined ending. Continuing directly into the opening title sequence, the fanfare leads to a wide variety of themes in different keys, meters, and tempos, and with quite different characters. The “pivotal event” that helps to set the tone for the rest of the film occurs right at the moment of the fanfare’s resolution.",

However, other frequent characteristics of studio logos are not present, such as the use of “a single sustained chord” or “simple cadential progressions” leading to a “final, almost invariably major triad” as part of a “self-contained musical [statement]” (2). Instead, Steiner’s fanfare oscillates between chromatic-mediant related harmonies on its way to a destabilizing VII ♯ chord that has no prescribed resolution.",

The first Howard Jackson-scored film featuring the Steiner fanfare is likely Beloved Brat (April 30, 1938), and the first film by Kaun appears to be Blackwell’s Island (March 1939), but there may well have been others—many of the B films scored by Jackson and Kaun during this period are difficult to find today. Franz Waxman used Steiner’s fanfare a few times during his stint at Warner Bros. (1943–1947) for Old Acquaintance in 1943 and Her Kind of Man in 1946. But his first film at Warner Bros.— Air Force (1943)—used original opening music. Erich Wolfgang Korngold had enough star-power to be an exception to the norm at the Warner Bros. studio (and enough time to create new overtures for each film, since he only accepted one or two film assignments per year). However, his opening music for The Sea Hawk (1940) bears some interesting similarities to Steiner’s fanfare as well.",

For the other four films included in this list— Dark Victory (1939), Four Wives (1939), One More Tomorrow (1946), and On Moonlight Bay (1951)—we have cue sheet evidence that indicates Steiner composed the main title music. Cue sheets are official documents prepared by the studio to keep track of composer attributions for royalty purposes. These same cue sheets helped us to rule out several films where Steiner was the principal composer but likely did not create the main title music. For example, Steiner did most of the underscoring for the musicals Night & Day (1946), Love and Learn (1947), and My Wild Irish Rose (1947), but, based on the cue sheet data, the main titles were probably written by Ray Heindorf, who arranged and orchestrated the musical numbers in those films.",

Confessions of a Nazi Spy and Dodge City (both 1939) are unusually scored in the keys of C ♯ major and B major, respectively. The Sisters (1938) is sketched in B ♭ major, but Steiner writes a note to his orchestrator to have it transposed another half-step lower to A major: “Vito!

Many studios had such fanfares—another well-known example is Alfred Newman’s fanfare for 20th Century Fox (composed in 1933).

In A Star is Born (composed for Selznick Pictures), we see evidence of the first half of the WB fanfare, with the melodic content of the first measure (bracketed in Example 3) mapping onto m. 1 of Tovarich .

(9) But his colleagues quickly adopted it—long before Steiner himself would complete another film (see Example 5 ). Just two weeks after Tovarich was released, the fanfare was used by Adolph Deutsch in Swing Your Lady (released on January 8, 1938), and Ray Heindorf used it in Hollywood Hotel just one week after that (January 15). Heinz Roemheld’s first film of the year, Slight Case of Murder (March 5, 1938), also used the Steiner fanfare.

(16) By the mid-’50s, the Steiner fanfare had disappeared. Some of the possible reasons for its demise were (1) changes to the WB shield logo itself in 1948, perhaps spurring accompanying musical changes; (17) (2) the emergence of a younger generation of Hollywood film composers with new approaches to scoring (such as Alex North’s jazz-influenced score for A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951); and (3) the growing trend of using popular songs to open a film (such as Dimitri Tiomkin’s “Do Not Forsake Me” for High Noon in 1952).

We use Neo-Riemannian theory as well as various measures proposed by Frank Lehman ( 2013 ), Scott Murphy ( 2014 ), and Joti Rockwell ( 2009 ) to determine how diverse Steiner’s fanfare resolutions are. In the second section, we develop a simple formula to predict how the resolution of the fanfare might communicate the overall tone of a film, and we correlate this information with the film’s genre. In the third section, we show that the principal function of the transition following the fanfare was to delay the arrival of the main theme until the film’s title appeared on the screen.

From B major, Steiner resolves to all of the major and minor sonorities shaded pink in Example 13 .

(25) Along the inner ring of the circle, he resolves to just six of the twelve possible minor sonorities. Still, the overall coverage is remarkably broad.

Again we see that he favors resolutions to major sonorities (the upside-down triangles): 39 resolutions (75%) were to major triads, as opposed to 13 resolutions (25%) to minor triads. The diagram also shows that Steiner avoided almost all triads that had a B in them.

Indeed, Example 14a confirms that a slight majority of the resolutions (26 out of 49, or 53%) have a B ♭ in them (see the resolutions surrounding “ A ♯ ” in the diagram).

(34) This is a type of “sudden change, cleverly handled” ([5.3]). The fanfare resolutions in this corpus cannot always be understood as cadences, often landing on unstable harmonies that initiate transitional passages.

Resolutions might differ only by added melodic dissonance (as with #5), or chordal inversions (see #19). In some cases, the only difference between two resolutions might be how the melodic line resolves. For example, one of the #9 resolutions features a LEAP UP in the melody while the other features a CT (common tone). (38) One might also choose to group together resolutions that differ only by the addition of a dissonant pedal tone (see the last two rows in #32, for instance). Lastly, there are four special cases to be considered (shaded yellow in Example 15). Each of these fanfares is harmonically extended such that its resolution at the point of arrival is no longer a B major sonority (see #54–57 in Appendix B).

Considering only the fanfares composed between 1937 and 1947, 48 of these 62 resolved differently (77%, or over three-fourths). After 1948, Steiner tended to fall back on previous resolutions more often, even reusing thematic material from previous films on occasion. For example, the westerns South of St. Louis (1949) and Springfield Rifle (1952) both reuse the transitional theme from Virginia City (1940), which results in them all using fanfare resolution #2.

Accordingly, we have added two additional types from the Steiner corpus that meet the CMCR criteria (types “VII” and “VIII” in Example 17 ). These types resolve from a dominant to tonics in ♭ VII and II ♯ . For example, Dawn Patrol (#10 in the appendix) resolves from B to D (V to ♭ VII in E minor, or “Type VII”) and Santa Fe Trail (#22 in the appendix) resolves from B to F ♯ (V to II ♯ in E minor, or “Type VIII”).

(45) Column 8 provides data regarding Steiner’s preferred inversions. Although he resolves to all inversions of triads and sevenths, he strongly prefers resolutions to the most unstable inversions at the point of arrival, which initiates the transitional section. Notably, 68% of all triadic resolutions are to a second inversion triad (36 out of 53) and 40% of all seventh resolutions are to a third inversion sonority (11 out of 27). The harmonic instability of the transition will be further discussed below. Example 18 . Main theme keys (click to enlarge)",

We then theorized that we might be able to predict the overall tone of the film by using just two pieces of information taken from the point of arrival of the fanfare: (1) the sonority type of the chord that the fanfare resolves to, and (2) the way that the melody resolves.

Fanfares in crime films were significantly more likely to end with an unexpected common-tone resolution and were unlikely to feature a heroic upward leap. Perhaps this represents the desire to not heroicize criminals. Westerns typically featured heroic or positive rather than tragic or negative resolutions. (58) Films noir were significantly more likely to resolve with an unexpected common tone or a leap down  than with a heroic leap up or step up. This reflects the dark, generally more pessimistic tone of film noir. War films, on the other hand, seemed to favor an optimistic tone, with upward leaps happening 45% of the time.

The names of the starring actors are shown on-screen during the transition (if any). The film’s title appears on-screen, coordinated with the beginning of the main theme.

This might explain why the lengths of the transition sections are so diverse, ranging from 3 beats to 40 beats in length. (65) In the most extreme of these cases—the 40-beat transition in Lightning Strikes Twice (1951)—the main title is delayed until 0:26 seconds into the film. Here, Steiner continues to build tension by using an ascending sequence that highlights the appearance of each the names of the four starring actors (followed by the punctuation of two lightning strikes!) before finally bringing in the main theme (see Example 25 ).

Steiner creates this effect with sliding parallel polychords: C and B major triads slide up a half step to D ♭ and C.

The corpus study found that although the transitions were frequently unstable, both tonally and metrically, their principal function was to fill in the space between the fanfare and the arrival of the main title on the screen. James D’Arc notes that Steiner “possessed a unique facility for ‘catching’ things musically, an uncanny ability to match, with split second timing, exact and appropriate sounds with the action on the screen” ( 2002 , 3–4). With this study we have found that Steiner’s desire to synchronize music and imagery extends to the opening title sequences as well.",

Many of the techniques were invented by him, and many of his devices have become common practice. His is true mood music . . . that is also connective tissue, subtle and sensitive” ( Behlmer 1973 ). In this corpus study, we have examined some of this “connective tissue” in Steiner’s music—pivotal events that subtly shift the tone, sensitively provide emotional cues, and carefully connect what we hear with what we see on the screen.

To determine whether or not this was true, we examined each transition in terms of tempo, key, and meter to see if it (1) moved the tempo closer to the tempo of the main theme, (2) moved the key closer to the key of the main theme, or (3) moved the meter closer to the meter of the main theme. In other words, we wanted to see whether there was temporal, tonal, or metrical directionality from the fanfare through the transition to the main theme. (71) Example 33 .

In a handful of cases, significant ritardandi near the end of the transition occurred as well, nicely setting up a new tempo for the main theme. But just as often, contrasting tempi are simply juxtaposed. For example, in Pursued (1947), the fanfare starts at 88 bpm, the transition increases to 138 bpm, and the main theme shifts to 96 bpm. Similarly, in Dive Bomber (1941), the fanfare begins at 84 bpm, the transition decreases to 72 bpm, and the main theme shifts suddenly to 120 bpm. These do not communicate temporal directionality.",

Of these, eight moved directly from C major to the key of the main theme, twelve moved to a key that was more closely related to the main theme, and two approached the key of the main theme through a process of linear chromaticism. 13 of the transitions (21%) moved farther away from the key of the main theme. More significantly, 29 of the transitions (43%) were tonally unstable. A few of these unstable transitions clearly arrive on the dominant of the main theme. (75) But more often, the keys are simply juxtaposed. For example, the transition for Santa Fe Trail (1940) connects the fanfare and main theme (both in C major) with a passage in F ♯ major. And in Dallas (1950), Steiner ends an unstable transition with a dominant in E, but brings in the main theme unexpectedly in the key of C. Overall, Steiner’s transitions do not consistently move closer to the key of the main theme, although their very tonal instability might help to set the main theme in better relief when it arrives.",

This much lower percentage partially reflects that fact that Steiner frequently maintained 4 4 meter throughout the fanfare, transition, and main theme (in 26 cases, or 39% of the examples). However, in the remaining 34 cases (where the meter does change) the transition clearly does not set up the meter of the main theme. Nine of these transitions are also metrically unstable. For example, in The Voice of the Turtle (1947), the transition shifts between 8 12 , 4 4 , and 4 6 meter, followed by a main theme in 8 6 meter.",
