    "abstract": "This article applies a modified species-counterpoint model, entitledspecies counterpoint with a moveable tenor, or SCAMET, to demonstrate the comparison of species counterpoint and “real” music. The tenorcantus firmusor “hard song” becomes a “hard note,” the note of longest duration at any moment and in any voice part. The classic rhythmic relationships between cantus and counterpoint are observed in the comparison (note against note in first species, two counterpoint notes against one cantus note in second) but are adjusted in duration where necessary (as two quarters against a half note, or two eighths against a quarter, for example). The ultimate aim of the model is to render instruction in counterpoint vivid where it is often seen as arid. Excerpts by composers from Lasso to Shostakovich are examined.",

On this account, the tenor in score measure 59 presents a 9–8 suspension, and the superius presents two successive thirds, the second of which is lowered chromatically. The A in the tenor on the second half of measure 59 would then become the preparation for a consonant suspension on the downbeat of measure 60. On the latter half of measure 60, however, this perspective breaks down: the consonant suspension A on the downbeat of measure 60 cannot resolve to a G, which is dissonant against the bassus D. In this case, then, reading the two chromatic superius tones of measure 60 as one virtual hard note is preferred.",

As Hellmut Federhofer ( 1982 , 68) puts it succinctly: around about 1900 a “new function of harmony and counterpoint” arose in Schenker’s thought: “The former was determined by the new significance attributed to the scale degree ( Stufe ) . . . [while] the latter was reduced to an exposition of the principles of part writing . . . . For according to Schenker the study of counterpoint “should not impart a particular style of composition so much as guide the ear of the music student into the infinite world of musical Urprobleme . . . . ” This, as William Drabkin ( 1989 , 199 points out, is made readily apparent in both of Schenker’s treatises, Harmony and Counterpoint : “‘strict’ counterpoint differs from real music by the very absence of scale degrees other than the tonic. For Schenker, harmony and strict counterpoint were separate disciplines which had to be taught separately; once mastered, they could be used to produce ‘free,’ that is, original, composition.”",

In all three instances, cantus firmus whole notes appear on the latter half of the measure but are missing entirely from the first half.  In his commentary upon the example, Schubert acknowledges parenthetically the motion of the cantus from one part to another: “(in [Cerone’s] example, you can think of the whole notes as CF notes that move from one part to the other).” But he gives no accounting of the first half of the bar, apparently bereft of a cantus note. From the vantage point of this article, these measures are based on moveable hard notes, certainly the latter half of each measure. Similar intriguing passages appear elsewhere in Schubert’s text. We find one on page 11, Example 1-2, taken from Tigrini; this seems half in and half out of species counterpoint. We find another on page 22, from Zarlino, (Example 2-5), where the slow moving cantus firmus is broken in the second measure to make a cadence.

The rhythmic relationship of counterpoint to cantus can be expressed as a ratio: 1:1 (one note of counterpoint to one of cantus), 2:1, and 4:1 (allowing for slight alterations and combinations of these in the fourth and fifth species). Rule 2, the constant cantus speed rule , stipulates that the duration of notes in the cantus must remain the same throughout the exercise in question (usually taking the duration of a whole note in a species exercise).

The hard note constitutes a long note in any given voice against which a counterpoint voice moves in shorter note values.

We call this fictional note “logical” because its choice should involve a voice-leading logic, wherever possible. In setting that logic, let us invoke customary rules of voice leading. For instance, the choice of logical hard note could observe one of the following familiar voice-leading constraints: 2.3.1. The logical hard note relates to a prior note in a real voice part as if it were a suspension thereof, or 2.3.2. The logical hard note relates to a prior note in a real voice part as if it were approached by stepwise motion from that note, or 2.3.3.

In this regard, the student of counterpoint should have little trouble mastering the basic notion of logical hard note if a methodologically comparable notion—that of a postulated chordal root—is borne in mind.

Other possibilities might be eliminated for stylistic reasons—for example, to avoid the cross relation where uncharacteristic. The principal criterion for the choice of a logical hard note should be its utility in making comparisons with the score. Let the following guideline apply: 2.3.4. The choice of hard note should be determined by its utility in making comparisons between the score and species counterpoint. Two or more hard notes may be considered individually (in separate examples) if they yield independent and fruitful comparisons. In some instances of multi-voiced counterpoint, however, two or more simultaneous hard notes will suggest themselves as equal in utility—and they may be considered together, in a single example.

On this account, each counterpoint voice stands on its own in relationship to the hard note as if it were one layer, part of a process of enveloping the hard note with independent layers of counterpoint. (3) Successive composition allows us to examine dissonance arising between counterpoint parts in a texture of three or more voices as the fortuitous byproduct of independent two-voice counterpoints. It allows us as well to delimit the application of the method: where dissonance is treated chordally—where there is an unresolved chordal seventh, for example—the SCAMET model as a vehicle of comparison might better yield to other forms of analysis.

The conclusion of Purcell’s Second Fantasia (see the score, Example 6a ) calls for us to modify ad hoc this rule: in these measures the hard note takes the form of two half notes, the latter being the chromatic inflection downward of the former. Two distinct half-note pitches, in other words, are joined as one hard note. Since the basic interval in question is retained but altered chromatically—a major sixth becomes a minor sixth, for example—we shall treat the two notes in question as one. (8) Therefore, in Example 6b , species measures 7, 8, and 10–13, a virtual hard whole note encompasses two chromatically inflected half notes. These correspond to a chain of four descending semitones (score measures 59–60, repeated in measures 61–62) and a chain of fifth-related semitone pairs (score measures 62–65). (9) The hard notes comprised of two half notes in score measures 59–60 produce 2–3 suspensions between the superius and tenor, while those in measures 62–65 produce 7–6 suspensions between tenor and bassus. The effect is one of a remarkable chromatic slippage intensified by the suspensions and made all the more extraordinary by the quasi-cadential arrival on F at the last measure, decorated by a simple 4–3 suspension. (10) Accordingly let us add the following clause: 2.3.6. A hard note can be understood to comprise two component notes, one a chromatic inflection of the other, where this facilitates comparison of score and species counterpoint. One or both component notes shall be referred to as the hard note when applying species-contrapuntal rules.

Much the same is true of the downbeat of species measure 12 (Example 8b). On beat 1, the superius strikes a discord with the bassus as a tritone. Seen in light of a logical D in the lowest part, however, the superius creates a 7–6 suspension in species measure 12, and the bassus a consonant third, F ♯ . On beats 3 and 4, the first altus and tenor can be seen thus as passing-tone dissonances left by leap (indicated with large asterisks in the example). Again, this is not to suggest that Gesualdo was writing deliberately arcane counterpoint. Instead, it would seem as if he were writing a particularly advanced form of counterpoint for an audience that did not require an explicit regulatory frame of consonance for their understanding but might instead have been capable of adducing one, to their delight, from the nature of the dissonances.

Speaking in the abstract terms of species measures, let us say that suspensions 1 and 2 constitute two different suspension “durations”: long (2 measures) and short (1.5 measures). And the two suspensions present two suspension “interval types”: suspended seventh resolving to sixth, and suspended fourth resolving to third. Suspensions 1, 2, 4, and 6 occur on beat 1 in the actual score; suspensions 3 and 5 occur on beat 3. Let us call this a shift in “weight” and represent it in two forms: first, beat 3 dissonance with beat 1 resolution; and secondly, beat 1 dissonance with beat 3 resolution. To summarize, each suspension may be long (two measures) or short (one and a half measures), 7–6 or 4–3, and with dissonance on beat 1 or beat 3. Any combination of these three qualities is possible.

Perfect intervals are to be perfect, and they are to be approached correctly . . . . ” Bent suggests then that the “main and constant rules” are concise. This leaves open, however, the possibility of “secondary and inconstant” rules, subsidiary and malleable rules brought to bear upon individual instances. These soft rules may have eluded codification by theorists, being left instead to composers and performers to work out, aided by unwritten tradition. In redesigning SCAMET for the purposes of style analysis, its counterpoint rules might be put into categories—few and simple (after Bent), supplemented by manifold and complex rules required of individual musical works or repertoires (such as the works of Gesualdo).

The latter chapter, however, shows a greater freedom in conception, much as its author confesses. Zarlino writes: If he chooses to write his own subject, he may find that one part helps him compose the other so that the subject and the composition are completed more or less together. What I call the subject, as I said earlier, is either the first part to be written or the first to be imagined by the composer. The more he bears in mind the rules given in connection with counterpoint on a cantus firmus, the easier will be his task. The present method of composing, it is true, is much freer and spontaneous, because either the upper or the lower part may be diminished at will. Thus one part has somewhat longer note values than the other, or the values of the two parts correspond. These are all things not possible in the first mode of writing. ( Zarlino 1976 , 103)",

On this account, florid counterpoint is arrived at by successive elaboration of a basic first-species framework, (22) this including the elaboration of the cantus: “The cantus firmus itself is paraphrased so that it, too, can participate in the canon” ( 9 ).

As the subject (or cantus voice) is “diminished” by embellishment, its diminutions could be measured against hard notes in a counterpoint voice; in other words, the hard note might pass from the cantus voice to the counterpoint as the former undergoes diminution, the cantus staying all the while in its proper voice.

In essence, a cell is a short phrase ending with a cadence, typically in stretto imitation, passed around the voices imitatively. The cell is not a subject per se, but much shorter. The cell is subject to modification, but its repetition in various voices can be said to structure the piece. This notion resembles SCAMET on two accounts: first, the cell as point of reference—of focus—is moveable, migrating between voices. Second, it stands in lieu of a cantus in certain notable works of Byrd, and thus constitutes what Kerman ( 1975 , 38) calls “a modern technique” (in comparison, for example, to ostinato). In SCAMET a point of reference is passed between voices to structure the counterpoint; in Kerman’s theory a melodic cell is passed between voices to structural ends.",

Jessie Ann Owens suggests a form of reduction practiced by Palestrina, this implied in the following contemporary account: Having passed recently through a serious illness and being thus unable to compose . . . Palestrina has begun to set the Kyrie and Gloria of the first mass on the lute . . . . As soon as his infirmity permits he will work out what he has done on the lute with all possible care. (25) She poses the question: “Was Palestrina playing the Mass as it would have sounded as a choral composition, or was he simply giving [his listener] a taste, perhaps playing the essential sonorities, the main motives, playing a kind of reduction for lute?” ( Owens 1997 , 295).

Fuller invokes the notion of “directed progressions,” ( 69 ) these enlivened by “unsettled sonorities.” The concept of the lively directed progression standing in lieu of a determinate structure bears analogy with SCAMET. Presumably singers, knowing where a cantus melody moved by long and by short notes, could improvise counterpoint: where the cantus voice slowed, the counterpoint voice might flourish, and where the cantus voice moved rapidly, the counterpoint might slow down against it. The relation of the faster to the slower voice might have been regulated by species-like guidelines.

The expert understanding of the Kenner as performer, however, must have produced a musical capacity comparable to the Fuxian, if not exceeding. Hence the possibility of a Renaissance Fux (and a Renaissance SCAMET) is not beyond reason.",

As Bent ( 1998 , 25) puts it: “Thus it is from the combination of notated music and learned counterpoint that the music can take shape; the two are complementary. We can understand it fully neither from the rules of counterpoint alone, nor from the notation read at ‘face value.’” In this regard, the most formidable problem of anachronism facing SCAMET is twofold—notational and contrapuntal. We ought to understand counterpoint in light of the notation of the day, to which the modern measure (and its rigid division into strong and weak beats) is counterintuitive. We ought to understand species counterpoint not as a set of rules complete in itself, but rather as an aural sketch of the contrapuntally possible—a mere sketch, not exhaustive. (28) (We could extend this here to condition counterpoint by tonality, the tonal framework—hexachord and solmization, species of fourth and fifth, mode—but the necessary relationship of counterpoint and tonality has been made explicit elsewhere, certainly in Schubert 2008 .)",

The SCAMET system of notating species measures equal to the whole note length of the hard note, however, still suggests a sense of regular pulse organized around an accented downbeat and subsequent unaccented offbeats. To overcome the anachronism of a measure, some new stressed point of reference for the linking of consonant onset and subsequent dissonance needs to be developed.",

                "text": "[100] As noted in the introduction, some of SCAMET’s basic ideas have antecedents, but these are often expressed in terms of analysis or composition. Diether de la Motte’s fascinating Kontrapunkt: Ein Lese- und Arbeitsbuch ( 1981 ) applies species-like ideas to analysis, but not systematically. Fred Maus ( 1992 , 93) suggests that the precision of Peter Westergaard’s rules “makes it easy to do without a cantus firmus ,” but notes that Westergaard himself “does not take advantage of this possibility . . . .” (Both Maus and Westergaard, however, are concerned with composition, not analysis). Ernst Krenek ( 1959 , [i]) omitted “traditional training in the ‘five species’” entirely, while attempting to “produce a style close enough to the compositional procedures of Palestrina . . . to achieve . . . something of the flavor of living great music.” But the resulting manual is really too succinct to be useful in this regard. Frederick Horwood ( 1958 ) addresses something like SCAMET, but informally, by introducing the notion of a cantus firmus itself in a florid style: “The melodic ideas already introduced consist of one, two, three or four notes to one beat, with some suspensions. It is possible to combine these rhythms in such a way that produces a flowing type of melody which combines well with a C.F. also in florid style” ( 27 ). Horwood’s treatment is so abbreviated as to do little but whet the appetite of the interested student. Almost any text that turns from strict species counterpoint to imitative counterpoint will involve “mixing” the species—not merely in the sense of fifth species, but more so by introducing notes of mixed durations in every imitative voice. Such is the case in Henry Martin’s Counterpoint: A Species Approach Based on Schenker’s Counterpoint ( 2005 ). Martin puts succinctly what I have laid out systematically here when he introduces two-part counterpoints “whose entrances are in imitation and unsupported by a C.F. ” [my emphasis]. Where note values are the same in two parts, the passage “should follow the rules of the two-part first species . . . .” Where the note values differ, “then the slower note provides a momentary CF for the other voices. Accordingly, write the voice with the faster note values in the two-part mixed species relative to the slower note.” ( Martin 2005 , 91–92) In effect this is SCAMET, the method proposed in this article, albeit in highly condensed form and applied to composition.",

Moveable hard notes are sprinkled throughout the text, (29) but the matter breaks out in force in chapter 11, “Two Parts in Mixed Values,” where he introduces canon. In this chapter, cantus firmus species in whole notes are more the exception than the rule. Schubert stipulates, “When half notes occur against half notes, or quarters against quarters, treat as first species . . . . When quarters occur against halves, treat as second species” ( 2008 , 144).",

Especially in a sixteenth-century style, where durational flow and flexibility are critical, the predictable metric regularity of the early species might stifle the elastic feel for nuances and gentle differences between rhythmic lifts and landings” ( Rogers 2004 , 66). It is precisely with such a danger in mind that this article is written. Without detracting from the basic exposure to the strict species exercise, the model proposed here would aim to lighten the study of counterpoint through comparison of species exercise to real music.",
