And as late as the end of the nineteenth century, Hugo Riemann cited Zarlino as a source of parts of his harmonic theories” ( Lester 1992 , 8).",

I am particularly grateful to the ensemble Singer Pur , and especially Marcus Schmidl and Martin Stastnik, for their collaboration on a recently released recording of Zarlino motets which made the publication of this keynote address possible ( Singer Pur 2013 ). I would like to acknowledge a publication subvention from the Society for Music Theory, which supported the recorded examples of this address. I would also like to thank Michael Noone for his collaboration on the recording of another group of Zarlino motets ( Ensemble Plus Ultra 2007 ).

More specifically I will speak to the relationship of theory and composition, and yet more narrowly, how we understand that relationship as manifest in the works of a single individual. In doing so, I will take advantage of the opportunity to introduce Zarlino’s compositions, works you may be likely to know something about, but less likely to actually know or have experienced.

It does not quite belong in full membership of the professional world of music theory.  Symptomatic of this situation is the legitimacy of a question such as the following, which a young and bright music theorist with a penchant for the historical might ask himself:  “Will I damage my career prospects if I publish disproportionately in history of theory?  Will I become suspect of a lack of commitment to expanding and advancing the body of contemporary compositional theory, or suspect of a disinterest in analytical practice?” ( Bent 1992 , 2) He later continues: But the same thing goes on in the field of music history.  The budding historian with a penchant for the theoretical may ask herself the counter-question: “Will I damage my career prospects if I publish disproportionately in history of theory ?  Will I become suspect of a lack of commitment to music itself as the central concern of music history?” ( Bent 1992 , 3) About both perspectives, he suggests a legitimacy to what might be perceived as paranoia underlying the question.  And, although in his gender assignments, Bent may merely have been being even-handed—even attempting gender neutrality—as an aside, I am struck that the assignment of a male pronoun went to the music theorist (“a young and bright music theorist with a penchant for the historical might ask himself . . . ”) and the female to a music historian (“the budding historian with a penchant for the theoretical may ask herself . . . ”), distinctions that were representative then—as now—of real gender imbalances in the music theoretic world and its subfields.

I confess that I was stunned to see in the margins of this article—itself  concerned with marginalia and marginalization—that I had scrawled beside the paragraph describing a theorist worried about career prospects—“Is this me?”  ( Illustration 3 ).  I don’t think my question was about the “young and bright” part but rather about potentially damaging career prospects.

It is a distinction between rational idea and empirical experience, and those two need to be confronted one with the other, not just assimilated one to the other.  Musical theories have cultural significance in their own right, as part of the history of ideas; music-theoretical traditions can be and should be investigated independently of practical traditions.  Relationships between theory and practice are not a priori , they are ad hoc , so any eventual confrontations of theory and practice ought to be pragmatic, and on a case-by-case basis.  We cannot naively adduce the writers on music in a given musical culture as straightforward testimony to musical practice.  They, like we, are more likely to be handing on traditional theory, or making their own theories, rather than just objectively reporting what practical musicians are doing.” ( Powers 1993 , 14–15)",

As a theorist, Zarlino’s name is well known to all in this room, although I suspect the depth of engagement with his work is considerably varied.  (At this point, I am tempted to do one of those pedagogical “clicker” exercises where I throw up slides with true or false statements to find out just what the extent of knowledge is in the room before I forge ahead—but I’ll save any quizzes for the bar.)  The likely point of connection for most will be his treatise, Le istitutioni harmoniche , first published in 1558 ( Illustration 4 ). If I were a publisher bringing out a new edition of the Istitutioni harmoniche and looking for some puffs for the back of the dust jacket, I wouldn’t have a hard time finding suitable referees. Beethoven, for example, turned to Zarlino when he composed the Missa Solemnis ( Kirkendale 1970 ). And Zarlino has certainly had reviews that many of us would covet on our book jackets.  Just imagine a book cover that read like this: no theorist since Boethius was as influential upon the course of the development of music theory – Robert Wienpahl, Journal of the American Musicological Society (1) Zarlino alone was preeminently influential on later theorists in numerous countries.  His formulations  . . .  were authoritative for musicians in Italy, France, Germany, and England – Joel Lester, Compositional Theory in the Eighteenth Century (2) the prince of modern musicians – Rameau (3) the theorist of his century and maybe of all centuries – Alfred Einstein (4) I could go on to add encomia from Matthew Shirlaw, Hugo Riemann, and many, many others, but I think you get the drift. (5) I will just add one more for currency: . . . the most famous music theorist between Aristoxenus and Rameau (Wikipedia)",

Gustave Reese, with wonderfully ambiguous, but ultimately damningly faint praise, described Zarlino as an: “estimable composer” ( Reese 1954 , 379). I could go on, but I think you get the drift.

Born in 1517, in Chioggia, a town on the southernmost edge of the Venetian lagoon, Zarlino was ordained as a priest and served as organist at Chioggia cathedral (where he had been a choirboy) before moving to Venice in 1541. There, in the 1540s he was a student of many things, among them Greek and Hebrew, but most notably, for our purposes, music with Adriano Willaert.  What else he was doing for much of his first two decades in La Serenissima remains something of a mystery, but he did have a series of publications, including his first book of motets in 1549 and his theory treatise in 1558, which was then reissued twice in near succession (not, I would hasten to add, as a runaway bestseller, but most likely as leftover copies that were repackaged with new title pages). Several madrigals were published in 1562 and two four-voiced motets appeared in 1563.  In 1565, Zarlino was appointed to the most coveted musical position in Venice when he was named maestro di cappella at the basilica of San Marco, a position he held for a quarter century until his death in 1590.  Shortly after his appointment at San Marco, a second book of motets appeared, the Modulationes sex vocum , followed by six further madrigals.  In 1571, he published a subsequent treatise, the Dimostrationi harmoniche , followed two years later by a substantially revised edition of the Istitutioni in 1573.  Both treatises were published in revised editions in conjunction with the complete works edition appearing near the end of his life, which also included the Sopplimenti musicali . Illustration 5 summarizes these theoretical and musical publications. Illustration 5 . Timeline of selected events and publications in Zarlino’s life (click to enlarge) Illustration 6 .

Although somewhat lengthy, I would like to quote the complete dedication, from which I will highlight three passages. To my most brilliant lord procurators of Saint Mark’s concerning those matters broached above. [May you have] felicity everlasting. Having collected from various places certain extremely beautiful musical compositions, Most Brilliant and Most Noble Senators, composed once upon a time by the Most Famous musician Gioseffo Zarlino of Chiogga, I thought it would be worthwhile to make them public. For the author himself, being an utter stranger to any form of ambition, was so far from ever letting them get out that there is danger he may become angry with me for doing so. But however that may be, it will nevertheless be beneficial to take thought, to the best of my ability, both for all musicians and especially for the reputation of my mentor; because long ago now he so taught me the arts of music as it will never come to pass that I could feel regret; besides which, so humane and pious is he that he will easily forgive me this offense, especially since he knows that I should not have done it except by reason of piety. But neither do I regard this as a rash deed, for after that distinguished book to which he gave the title On the Institutes of Harmony in which he seems to discourse on the discipline of music with such learning and eloquence that no one yet (and let this be said with the indulgence of all) has treated this particular subject more clearly or fully, who is there that would not long for the second book of compositions? And all the more so, because he very frequently makes mention of these matters in the earlier book? Another motive is that all should understand that this same artist is able to discourse learnedly on the theoretical aspects of music and to produce the most lovely of all compositions. But away with the rabble of backbiters and (to speak more truthfully) that pernicious pestilence that is never slow to detract from the fame of others; wherefore I thought it best to take refuge with you, excellent Senators, so that you might, by your unsurpassed authority, together with me protect from the venomous carping of these people the same man to whom you, not without God’s will, assigned such an office as the leadership of all the musicians in the Choir of Saint Mark’s. For with you as our patrons we shall have no fear of such barking sycophants. And furthermore, lest anyone think that I am doing more on others’ behalf than on my own, I shall very shortly publish certain compositions of my own, such as they are, which are to be presented to you as by your right, you to whom just as before I now dedicate and commit both myself and all my possessions. That you will aid me by your patronage and protect me by your authority I ask you and trust that it will be so. May God Almighty keep and protect you for your own good and that of the Republic. Farewell. Venice, March 1566. Your humble servant, Philippo Zusberti, musician in the Choir of San Marco. (Translation from Judd 2000 , 248–49)",

Here Zusberti alludes to Zarlino’s character in ways that would seem to be wishful thinking with regard to what we know about Zarlino (a kind of rhetoric of opposites): Zarlino’s career trajectory suggests that he was, in fact, highly ambitious.

And it is also worth remembering that he assumed the position after Willaert’s long tenure (see Illustrations 11a and 11b ) and Cipriano de Rore’s brief and tumultuous stint as maestro di capella .  These were two men of extraordinary musical reputations in their lifetime. The last years of Willaert’s tenure were plagued by chronic absenteeism by musicians, who hired poorly-trained substitutes while they themselves slipped away for higher paying gigs.  A five-month vacancy after Willaert’s death did not help matters, and the total reorganization of the chapel upon Rore’s appointment only exacerbated the eroding discipline and chaos.  Zarlino’s appointment signaled an attempt to end nearly a decade of disarray. (6) When hiring Zarlino, the procuratori said they were looking for a person “not just excellent in the practice of music, but someone superior to the other musicians, prudent and modest in the fulfilling of his duties” (quoted in Edwards 1998 , 393). His initial appointment was a two-year contract with the possibility of renewal for three additional years.  Not a lot of time to turn around an unruly bunch of singers and instrumentalists!  Throughout his tenure, from the records of the procuratori , we really learn about Zarlino, the administrator (a story I may be especially attuned to or sympathetic to as a present-day administrator).

Appearing a scant two years after the treatise’s publication, these labels hint at the genesis of Zarlino’s own twelve-mode theory, which was to be published almost a decade later. Other aspects of the print tie its works closely to the mid 1540s, the period after Zarlino arrived in Venice, when he was not only studying composition but also Greek, Hebrew, and theology. The collection contains thinly veiled autobiographical pointers and wears its learning anything but lightly: a civic motet connected to Chioggia; a pseudo-Horatian ode befitting Zarlino’s classical learning; antiphons proper both to St. Martin, patron of the Chioggia church where Zarlino was trained, and to St. Mark, patron of the basilica in Venice; overt references to compositions by Verdelot and Willaert, among others, and so forth ( Illustration 17 ). But the umbrella under which all of this exists is a modal one.  The works are ordered by what Powers has labeled as tonal types—that is, markers of system, ambitus, and final, which represent modes ( Illustration 18 ). These are precisely the modal categories that Zarlino will take over as the subject matter of the fourth and final book of the Istitutioni , dropping Glarean’s Greek names and instead simply numbering them. Just as the preoccupation of the 1566 motet book is the counterpoint that makes up the third book of the treatise, so the modes are the overt signposts of this collection ( Illustration 19 ). (8)",

Nevertheless, the priorities of the two compositional collections are clear—the modal preoccupations are nowhere in evidence in the 1566 collection, while the canonic virtuosity of the later book hardly features in the first book.  And the relationship is a remarkably fluid one ( Illustration 21 ).",

The seven-voice Pater noster – Ave Maria concludes both of Zarlino’s motet collections and was also the most frequently cited of his own works in Le istitutioni harmoniche (see Illustrations 22a and 22b ). The motet is Zarlino’s longest and most complex, and one of the few works for which a manuscript copy is also known to survive. The context of the Pater noster is complicated: the motet belongs to a sixteenth-century tradition of Pater noster – Ave Maria motet settings ranging from Josquin to Lasso and beyond, and the 1549 and 1566 versions of the motet provide evidence of significant reworking.

Note that in the 1549 partbook, two voices appear on a single page (Illustration 22a); in 1566, these appear in separate partbooks (Illustration 22b). Illustration 23 shows that the soggetto appears in the tenor “at pitch”; the sextus anticipates by three breves at the fifth above, while the septima vox follows by three breves at the fourth above.  As you can see from the opening of the realization of the canonic scaffold, the cantus firmus is set in relatively long note values and the three-breve distance results in minimal overlap of the canonic voices, generally for only a minim or a breve.  Similarly, new phrases of the chant dovetail with previous phrase, if at all, for only a minimal span, as can be seen by the opening of the canonic framework.",

Text is repeated less frequently and repetition of small sub-phrases of text is generally eschewed (see Illustration 25 ). The musical corollaries to these general principles follow: overall, fewer syllables of text are set—and they are set more syllabically—with the result that voices sometimes drop out of the texture, which in turn becomes somewhat less dense.

Here Zarlino addresses what the composer should observe when composing, how harmonies are accommodated to words, how note values are assigned, and so forth. (11) These chapters offer a concise compendium of practical advice to composers, while also firmly situating the preceding discussion of counterpoint and the modes.  And attention to composers is always balanced by attention to performers or observers: what is necessary for composing, what is necessary for singing, what is necessary for judging. Like so many parts of books three and four of Le istitutioni harmoniche , these chapters present a prescriptive version of a situation that was clearly in flux. If the Pater noster can be taken in any sense to be exemplary, the compositional approach clearly shifted in significant ways between the publication of the first anthology and the publication of the motet book of 1566, but the particular role played by the intervention of the theory treatise is uncertain.",

For example: The whole task consists of assigning note values to given words, and it is essential in a composition that by this means the notes be described and notated in such a way that the sounds and tones can be performed in every melodic line. ( Zarlino 1983 [1558] , 97) Illustration 31 . Pater noster facsimiles of 1549 and 1566 in comparison (click to enlarge) It would seem that this is exactly the task represented in the later version of the Pater noster .  That task included not merely fitting syllables of phrases to the notes that had already been provided nor simply of understanding how to allocate the syllables in the case of minimal or ambiguous underlay.  Rather, this recomposition departs from a work in which the assignment of text syllable to music is remarkably unambiguous—indeed the 1549 print is exceptional for its clarity and I have elsewhere argued ( Judd 2006 and 2007 ) for its preoccupation with the clear declamation of text by individual voices.  Yet in 1566, the music is altered in the service of that same text. In that alteration, we have a rather unusual perspective, closely tied to changing preferences.  Taken in their entirety, the two versions of the Pater noster betray significantly different approaches to text setting, neither of which is actually in conflict with what Zarlino says about text setting in the treatise, nor which can fully stand as an exposition of text setting principles. Illustration 31 removes the treatise from Illustration 30, placing the two versions of Pater noster side by side. As it turns out, the compositions in the “modal” motet anthology cannot be taken at face value to be an exposition on mode, nor those in the “counterpoint” anthology to be an exposition of counterpoint. In these two versions of the Pater noster , we see a wonderful complication of the theoretical exposition of text setting.",

I confess that I have not yet discovered whether, in Bent’s dichotomy, I am a music theorist who is interested in history or a historian who is interested in music theory.  Fortunately, in my case the blurred boundaries seem to have been career-enabling and enriching rather than career ending.  And returning to the 8 a.m. freshman theory class to which I made fleeting reference at the start of this address, it is perhaps revealing that the title of the rather unconventional textbook for the first class I took in college was Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach ( Cooper 1973 ), a title which in some ways sums up my career to date (the moral being:  you never know just how much influence you wield in those 8 a.m. freshman theory classes!). This description reflects my own proclivity for working in detail at the local level and my sense that this allows the most profitable move to the bigger picture in a reflexive, interpretive turn.  But it also stems from the pragmatic turn to which Powers alluded:  “Relationships between theory and practice are not a prior i, they are ad hoc , so any eventual confrontations of theory and practice ought to be pragmatic, and on a case-by-case basis.”  I hope, at least in the case of Zarlino, that I have offered some new perspectives for contemplating that relationship.",
