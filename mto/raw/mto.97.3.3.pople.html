<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Most readers of <i>MTO</i> will already have encountered David Epstein&rsquo;s 
<i>Shaping Time</i>; many will have dipped into it; a far smaller number, I 
imagine, will have read it in its entirety. For it is a long book, by 
no means lacking in repetitiousness, and requiring of the reader 
several shifts of perspective along the way. 
 <p>

[2] What sort of book is it?&mdash;this was a question I found myself 
constantly trying to address. It has all the appearance of a grand 
statement, but clearly it is not a &ldquo;tenure book,&rdquo; since Epstein is 
well past that stage of his career. It is to some extent a follow-up 
to Epstein&rsquo;s earlier book <i>Beyond Orpheus</i>, in that it pursues in 
greater depth the ramifications of proportionally related tempos in 
music. It frequently uses the language of music theory; it includes a 
cross-cultural study; it presents empirical analysis of performance 
timings; it draws in ideas from neuropsychology. 
 <p>

[3] All of these ways of working, ways of writing, are used to 
rationalise musical opinions. Perhaps that should be their true 
purpose for us all, one which is obscured by their more hermetic 
pursuit as academic disciplines. But the golden rule of 
interdisciplinary study&mdash;even inter-subdisciplinary study&mdash;is that it 
should satisfy the rigours of both (or all) disciplines involved, and 
this, so far as I can see, is not what Epstein sets out to do&mdash;though 
it may well be what some will assume he has tried to do. 
<p>
 
[4] Essentially, I believe this is a book of advice about how to 
perform some pieces of music. It&rsquo;s a kind of musical memoir&mdash;the 
ordered reflections of a mature artist who has clear ideas about 
specific issues of performance and is well able to articulate 
them. Epstein wants us to know, for example, that when performed with 
certain proportional tempo relationships in mind, Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Fourth 
Symphony achieves a strength of character that stems from the fusion 
of passion with structure. In this it is not that distant from music 
of the German-Viennese heritage. Nor need its guiding pulse serve as a 
time prison. No one would suggest that this music, with its long 
romantic lines, its intense heights and depths, be confined in a 
temporal straightjacket. It needs at many moments and can easily live 
with an elastic pulse, swelling and contracting as the phrases may 
dictate. That is a matter of plasticity in tempo. By that fact it need 
not lose its central temporal unit, however&mdash;that basic pulse by which 
the entire work is held together (pages 322&ndash;3). 
<p>
 
[5] This view is not presented, however, as a description of common 
practice, as an end-product of theoretical distillation from the 
empirical observation of many performances in which an adherence to 
proportionally related tempos is found to be a common factor amid many 
obvious differences. On the contrary, Epstein begins his discussion of 
the piece by stating outright that &ldquo;Tchaikovsky deserves better&rdquo; than 
the &ldquo;tradition of expressive excess [which] has dogged this symphony, 
driving its climaxes to Himalayan heights, it depths to depressive 
troughs, all the while pushing and pulling its tempos as a means for 
reaching these extremes&rdquo; (pages 308&ndash;9). He then goes on to describe in 
some detail what tempo relations he advocates, relying for the force 
of his argument on the fact that the rightness of these tempos is true 
to his experience. 
<p>
 
[6] There are many other such examples in the book, covering a range 
of mainstream concert works, mostly from the nineteenth 
century. Setting conventional academic criteria aside, I have to say 
it is among these that I find the most rewarding pages in the book by 
far. When Epstein is describing what is true to his musical experience 
I feel I have something to learn. After all, what has any of us beyond 
our experience? I am happy to encounter performance advice of this 
caliber. 
 <p>

[7] But the book also attempts, quite sincerely I think, to be a 
number of other things in addition. There is an encounter with 
theories of rhythm and meter, which Epstein modestly but properly 
treats as an &ldquo;ongoing dialogue&rdquo; to which he merely contributes; there 
is an attempt on the basis of cross-cultural evidence to posit tempo 
proportionality as a musical universal in the Chomskyan sense; there 
is a continual attempt to account for tempo proportionality in terms 
of neurophysiology. The very language of the book constantly aligns 
it, more or less in alternation, with the academic subcultures of 
music theory and empirical musicology: there are lots of numbers and 
graphs. This allows him to be by turns elitist and more broadly 
empirical, but it is in the jostling of these narrative styles that 
the book becomes uncomfortable. Proportionally related tempo 
relationships &ldquo;allow&rdquo; motivic correspondences to be heard; motivic 
correspondences &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; that the tempos should be proportionally 
related in performance. (For example, in Mozart&rsquo;s Divertimento, K. 136 
(pages 172&ndash;4); his Symphony No. 29 (pages 174&ndash;9)&mdash;and these are but the 
first two examples in a long chapter.) 
<p>
 
[8] Epstein bravely steers his boat among the ice floes of composers&rsquo; 
metronome markings. He does not attempt to discount the usual caveats 
about, for example, Beethoven&rsquo;s markings. But in looking for 
proportional tempos among metronome markings given by a gallery of 
composers, he seems to overlook the fact that the standard MM numbers 
in themselves, which were established by Maelzel in the 1820s, embody 
proportionality almost throughout, in Epstein&rsquo;s terms. Beginning with 
40 bpm, the standard metronome compromises between, on the one hand, 
an &ldquo;equal tempered&rdquo; system of increases leading to 80 bpm, and, on the 
other hand, an orderly succession of integers. Maelzel&rsquo;s standard 
sequence: 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 63 66 69 72 76 80 [84 88 
92] has 16 steps between tempo &ldquo;octaves&rdquo; related 2:1. If these steps 
were equally spaced, with adjacent tempos related by a factor of 2 
raised to the power of 1/16, the succession would be as follows (to 
two decimal places): 40.00 41.77 43.62 45.55 47.57 49.67 51.87 54.17 
56.57 59.07 61.69 64.42 67.27 70.25 73.36 76.61 80.00 (Compare the 
logarithmic scale of tempos in Stockhausen&rsquo;s Gruppen.) If simply 
rounded to integers in the normal way, however, rounding errors would 
render the resulting sequence irregularly graduated: that is to say, 
some integer successions a b c would be such than c&ndash;b is less than b&ndash;a 
(54 57 59; 62 65 67; 73 77 80). Maelzel&rsquo;s metronome scale, on the 
other hand, does have the property of being regularly graduated, 
whilst also remaining in close approximation to the logarithmic 
scale. One corollary of this approximation is that if a low-integer 
proportional relationship can be observed between any two &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of 
the scale then that relationship will hold under &ldquo;transposition&rdquo; to 
other &ldquo;degrees.&rdquo; For example, the tempo-steps 60 and 40 are related in 
this way (3:2, or 2:3 in terms of beat lengths). &ldquo;Transposing&rdquo; the 
relationship &ldquo;up&rdquo; by one &ldquo;degree&rdquo; yields tempos of 63 and 42 
bpm&mdash;i.e., also in this proportional relationship. Even where 
precision breaks down&mdash;four steps further along, at 76:50 bpm&mdash;the 
proportion is 3.04 to 2, which is well within the range of tolerance 
Epstein allows in such matters&mdash;accuracy to with 5%, or from time to 
time a little more. Closer study suggests that only one &ldquo;interval 
class&rdquo; between tempos on the standard scale does not fit this 
criterion&mdash;namely ic2 (e.g. 40:44, 42:46, etc., and its 
direction-inverse 40:72, etc.). Thus in any score that includes MM 
numbers taken from the standard scale, whether or not these stem from 
the composer, low-number proportional tempo relationships, in 
Epstein&rsquo;s sense, are statistically likely to 
predominate. (Interestingly, whereas ic1 on the Maelzel scale&mdash;on 
average 4.4%&mdash;was presumably heard by the inventor as a noticeable 
difference, for Epstein it lies within the limits of tempo 
equivalence.) 
<p>
 
[9] The notation of tempo by composers, however, is not the be-all and 
end-all of Epstein&rsquo;s argument. Indeed, it seems possibly tangential, 
for in the main he is far more concerned with music as a re-creative 
than a creative art: with traditions of &ldquo;commonly heard tempos,&rdquo; with 
the perception of tempo relationships by listeners and their 
conception by performers, and with his own ideas of how certain pieces 
should best go. It may be observed, however, that this is not a strict 
distinction: in his discussion of <i>La mer</i>, Epstein is happy to present 
Debussy&rsquo;s notated relationship between q = 116 at I/1 and e = 116 at 
I/31 as if it were unarguably a proportional relationship. On paper it 
certainly is, but as Simon Trezise has shown in his study of the work 
(Cambridge University Press, 1994), this is a relationship that is 
scarcely if ever followed, even approximately, in performance: the 
opening is taken significantly faster than Debussy&rsquo;s metronome marking 
in all the recorded performances Trezise describes (1994, pages 29&ndash;31). 
<p>
 
[10] But elsewhere across his book Epstein accumulates sufficient 
evidence to convince me, for one, that the study of tempo is 
essentially a study of performance traditions. If his 
neurophysiological arguments stand up, then it is in this 
context&mdash;that of the mental processing in time that underpins a 
performance as it proceeds. The creative act(s) of the composer, and 
the imaginary performances from which metronome markings are sometimes 
derived, are a qualitatively different matter, psychologically 
speaking. As Epstein points out more than once, performance traditions 
accumulate &ldquo;right&rdquo; tempos, together with ways of hearing music based 
on &ldquo;right&rdquo; tempos. I find it instructive that one of his most 
spectacular results concerns a controlled ritardando over the space of 
half and hour or so, observed in the apparently wholly aural tradition 
of Himou conducted among the Yanomami people of Venezuela 
(pages 445&ndash;6). This is doubtless also a long aural tradition; and it is 
probably no coincidence that Epstein&rsquo;s studies of the concert 
repertory are centered on works which are sufficiently mainstream&mdash;I 
use this word to describe the constitution of an observable repertory, 
not to upset musicologists newer than I&mdash;for each to be carrying by 
the 1990s a well developed aural tradition of performance, albeit 
neither as long nor as wholly aural as that of the Yanomami. 
 <p>

[11] What, then, do composers&rsquo; metronome markings represent? This is 
one of the enduring questions on which an encounter with Epstein&rsquo;s 
book renews perspectives. If the &ldquo;rightness&rdquo; of tempos in performance 
is essentially a matter of aural tradition, what does this imply for 
today&rsquo;s historically aware performance practices? It would seem that 
even when a composer is known to have arrived at metronome markings by 
timing actual performances (of a sort), such markings can aspire to no 
more than being a point of departure for traditions of 
performance. But it is a point from which departure is made not once 
but many times, through a kind of time warp: every performer who works 
from the score will see those markings, and there will be some kind of 
interaction between them and the developing aural tradition of &ldquo;right&rdquo; 
tempos. In this sense, the difference between historically aware 
performances and &ldquo;normal&rdquo; performances is one of degree rather than 
kind. But I imagine I am not alone in finding many historically aware 
performances exciting because, among other things, they bring what for 
me are &ldquo;new&rdquo; tempos, and perhaps new tempo relationships, to familiar 
pieces. 
<p>
 
[12] The statistical analyses in Epstein&rsquo;s chapter on rubato demand 
careful scrutiny, since his method of determining integral proportions 
relies on the accuracy to the last decimal place of his timing data 
for individual beats. Similarly, I find the chapter on ritardandos and 
accelerandos interesting musically but in other respects less 
satisfying than it should be, because the cubic curves to which 
Epstein, and his co-author for this chapter, Jacob Feldman, claim to 
find a good fit for their timing data are so imprecisely 
described. Even their initial abstract presentation of cubic curves 
(page 419, especially Example 12.1a, which claims to show a simple cubic 
curve but doesn&rsquo;t, with misleading consequences) is seriously flawed 
because it is not sufficiently detailed mathematically. At the other 
end of the linguistic scale, the book&rsquo;s concluding chapter on &ldquo;affect 
and musical motion&rdquo; (pages 453&ndash;83) is written in a highly flamboyant 
style, albeit idiosyncratically seasoned with words like &ldquo;paradigm&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;structural.&rdquo; Reading Epstein&rsquo;s discussion of the opening movement 
of Mozart&rsquo;s Piano Concerto K. 466 simply forces one to dispense with 
any music-theoretic linguistic filters&mdash;since these overheat rapidly 
amidst appeals to &ldquo;darkly colored&rdquo; chords, to &ldquo;a sense of the 
ineffable,&rdquo; and so forth (page 470). Yet the chapter is musically 
instructive. Whether it is more instructive than a performance of the 
work along these lines would be, is a question it may not be fair to 
ask. Be that as it may, the value of the book lies, for me at least, 
in Epstein&rsquo;s willingness to invoke music theory and empirical 
performance studies at length and in detail&mdash;though without 
necessarily seeking to contribute directly to those disciplines or to 
satisfy professional scholars working within them&mdash;in order to convey 
insights about how music may be better played. I am not sure that this 
is such a bad thing to have attempted.</p>
