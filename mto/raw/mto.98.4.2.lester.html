<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] I open with two anecdotes that I believe to be both true 

and humorous&mdash;though ultimately they reflect a very sad 

reality.
</p>



<p>[2] Some years ago, I&rsquo;m told, the great violin pedagogue Joseph 

Gingold was coaching a student string quartet at Indiana 

University. He noticed that the first violinist, in addition to 

the first-violin part on his stand, also had a heavily 

annotated score to which he referred frequently. Gingold, a 

marvelous violinist, genuinely decent person, and wonderful 

teacher, picked up the score and asked the first violinist, 

&ldquo;What are these markings on the score?&rdquo; The violinist dutifully 

replied, &ldquo;Mr. Gingold, I&rsquo;m a double major, violin and theory. I 

wrote my analysis in the score.&rdquo; Gingold perused the score, 

closed it, put it down on a table on the other side of the 

room, and turned back to the quartet, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice hobby; now 

let&rsquo;s get back to music.&rdquo;
</p>



<p>[3] Lest we feel too good, we should realize that performers I 

know laugh at the punchline for the very opposite reason that 

theorists do. Actually, the double effect of the punchline 

reminds me of a concert in New York about a quarter century ago 

at which the composer George Crumb joined members of the Da 

Capo Chamber Players sitting on stage in Carnegie Recital Hall 

after a performance of Crumb&rsquo;s <i>Voice of the Whale</i> to field 

questions from the audience about the piece and its 

performance. After the usual queries to be expected following a 

Crumb piece&mdash;&ldquo;how did you discover those weird ways of playing 

the instruments?&rdquo; and the like&mdash;a doctoral student in theory 

stood up and asked: &ldquo;Mr. Crumb, I noticed in the opening flute 

vocalise that you use a gapped scale&mdash;that is, a scale with 

bunched semitones separated by augmented seconds and other 

larger intervals. I was wondering, was this an ethnic or exotic 

scale that you adopted or adapted, or did you invent it? And 

could you tell us about your motivations for using that scale?&rdquo; 

Crumb sat quietly for a considerable time, and then slowly 

intoned, &ldquo;Well<nobr> . . . </nobr>I suppose one <i>could</i> consider it a scale 

. . . I never did.&rdquo; Once again, the theorists in the audience 

laughed for quite a different reason than the composers and 

listeners; and I was reminded of the anger of the composer 

Miriam Gideon when she found out that a composer/theorist was 

using pitch-class set analysis to parse one of her songs. &ldquo;I 

didn&rsquo;t work out the relations among any of those chords,&rdquo; she 

exclaimed, &ldquo;I just put down the sounds that I liked.&rdquo;
</p>



<p>[4] Joining these realities are what most of us deal with day 

in and day out in our teaching and lecturing: many students or

concert audiences who either could care less about what we do 

as theorists, or who insist that it gets in the way of their 

listening or music-making. (Paul McCartney&rsquo;s refusal even to 

learn to read music because, he asserts, it would hamper his 

imagination is only the most extreme of such sentiments.) 

Theory for many of them is worse than broccoli is for George 

Bush&mdash;no matter how bad he thinks broccoli tastes, at least Bush 

understands that it might be good for you.
</p>



<p>[5] In short, I fear that we as theorists have not communicated 

very well what it is we do, what it is we know, and what 

relevance it has for other musicians: for performers, for 

composers, and for listeners. I believe that&rsquo;s a shame, because 

what we as theorists have to communicate is indeed crucially 

important to understanding what it is that other musicians do 

every time they interact with music.
</p>



<p>[6] The failures of communication are surely not entirely our 

own fault. Lazy sound-bite punchlines of the sort I offered 

above are just as detrimental to serious communication about 

music as sound-bite attack ads are to serious discussion of 

political issues. But if we care about what we do as theorists, 

we can ill afford to sit in our ivory towers and publish 

journal articles that are read by about as many people as can 

dance on the head of a pin. We need to inspire musicians to do 

the hard work of learning what we do, why we do it, and what is 

important about it. If anyone is to open the channels of 

communication, it must be us&mdash;I don&rsquo;t expect to find the 

members of the New York Philharmonic or the casts of the 

Metropolitan Opera suddenly deciding on their own to crowd the 

third floor of the New York Public Library to read the latest 

issues of <i>Music Theory Spectrum</i>. Not long ago, I was talking 

to a singer at the Met who looked at her watch and said, &ldquo;Oh, 

I&rsquo;m late for an appointment with my analyst,&rdquo; I quipped, &ldquo;A 

Freudian or a Schenkerian?&rdquo; She just looked puzzled; and when I 

explained who Schenker was, she confessed she&rsquo;d never heard of 

him.
</p>



<p>[7] I include performers, composers, and listeners in the 

category of &ldquo;other musicians.&rdquo; When performers choose one 

fingering, bowing, or tonguing over another; when composers use 

a chord because they &ldquo;like&rdquo; it; when listeners respond to 

passages&mdash;in all these interactions, I believe that these 

musicians are doing at least a part of what we do as theorists. 

Performers may not realize that their choices of fingering or 

bowing are &ldquo;analytic,&rdquo; but in the sense that those choices 

affect the projection of structure, they carry the same 

interpretive import as analytic notations.
</p>



<p>[8] I believe that we as theorists miss opportunities to relate 

to other musicians because we insist on framing issues within 

theoretical traditions, and not within the ways that other 

musicians have dealt with those issues. For instance, if we do 

our bibliographic searches and fail to find a precedent in the 

theoretical literature for our latest research, we come to 

believe that our theoretical discussion of an issue is the 

first time the issue has been raised. With that belief, we 

proceed to issue edicts as to how the issue under consideration 

should be projected in performance or how a composer must have 

conceived of it. As a result, most of the literature relating 

analysis to performance is based on the premise that we analyze 

a passage in such and such a way, and therefore performers 

should project what we have found. If they do it another way, 

we assert that they have it wrong because they fail to 

articulate our analysis. If the conversation ever gets so far 

as performers objecting to our performance directions, we 

respond by asking them to provide an alternative analysis.
</p>




<p>[9] Even further, we assume that an intentional act of analysis 

must precede any interaction between analysis and performance. 

This was the underlying and unchallenged premise of an extended 

discussion on the smt-list this past summer about analysis and 

performance. One strand of the discussion concerned Murray 

Perahia, who is one of those rare internationally famous 

concert artists who not only works out analyses but even admits 

it. Correspondents on the smt-list wondered if anyone could 

find a piece that Perahia had graphed and show how his 

performance had been affected by that graphing.
</p>



<p>[10] This request is based on the assumption that only when 

performers intentionally think about a piece and then proceed 

to perform it&mdash;only then can we speak of their performance 

reflecting an analysis. That assumption, it seems to me, 

confuses intention and outcome. If a man gets up in the morning 

and says &ldquo;Today, I will not intend to do anything,&rdquo; that does 

not mean that he has no responsibility for his acts, or that 

his acts have no causes. Every decision that is part of a 

performance has an affect on the projected structure. 

Performers communicate musical structure through performance, 

not through words and graphs.
</p>



<p>[11] I am reminded of a discussion I had with a young 

professional violinist recently about Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Violin 

Phantasy</i>. She had worked on the piece with her violin teacher 

before asking for coaching from Felix Galimir&mdash;who at 87 is 

perhaps the last active musician among us who was an important 

figure in the Viennese music world that existed between the two 

world wars. Felix is a man of few words&mdash;very few of which are 

analytical. He heard her play the piece, and commented, &ldquo;You 

know, today everyone thinks of Schoenberg as if he were a 

modern composer; and they try to play him that way. But you 

know, Schoenberg wanted his music to sound like Brahms.&rdquo; And 

Felix proceeded to work with her to achieve that end. Felix&rsquo;s 

point is not far from the tales told by Peter Stadlen about 

Webern&rsquo;s dissatisfactions with performances of his own music.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p> 



<p>[12] To be sure, the instruction that Galimir gave to this 

violinist was not delivered in analytical terms. But her 

performance underwent a transformation&mdash;a transformation no 

less dramatic than that of theorists who might begin their 

analysis of the <i>Phantasy</i> (or any atonal work) by locating the 

row-forms and pitch-class sets and considering their 

interactions, and then change perspective to consider the 

surface motives, the phrasing, and the directionality of the 

gestures. Just as such a change of theoretical perspective will 

affect the entire tone of an analytical discussion of the 

piece, the attitude change inspired by Galimir&rsquo;s coaching 

transformed this violinist&rsquo;s performance in ways that resonate 

with analytical and theoretical significance. An interesting 

interaction between this violinist and a theorist might arise 

as both considered how their perspectives on the piece changed 

as they focused on more precompositional or abstract aspects 

and then on more compositional or projection-related issues.
</p>



<p>[13] This allows us to consider how the perspectives of some 

recent Schoenberg articles in <i>Music Theory Spectrum</i> could 

enter this discussion. Joseph Auner&rsquo;s essay on <i>Die gl&uuml;ckliche 

Hand</i> and Brian Alegant&rsquo;s on op. 33b each deal in one way or 

another with the issue of structure as a reflection of 

Schoenberg&rsquo;s
compositional processes, which is likewise a central 
concern from a very different perspective in Ethan Haimo&rsquo;s essay on 

intentionality and analysis of atonal music. All three of these 

articles deal with the interaction of neoclassic and 

anachronistic impulses that is the focus of Martha Hyde&rsquo;s 

essay.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>



<p>[14] All these issues would bear on my imagined interaction 

between theorist and violinist talking about the violin 

<i>Phantasy</i>. I find it particularly heartening that the 

underlying premises of all these issues are being addressed 

from so many different perspectives, many of which did not even 

exist just a few years ago. How should these varied 

perspectives affect the way we play or hear Schoenberg&rsquo;s music? 

Surely, the violinist&rsquo;s approach will be affected by learning 

about how Schoenberg composed, about the differences between a 

perspective based on finding fixed set structures and on 

perceiving developing variations&mdash;both of which approaches are 

surely relevant to the <i>Phantasy</i>. And the theorist&rsquo;s thinking 

about the piece will surely be affected by hearing the way it 

changes depending on the violinist&rsquo;s focus.
</p>



<p>[15] But where could such an exchange take place? It would not 

happen in our journals, since performers cannot <i>perform</i> 

there! The verbal format of so many, if not all our theoretical 

forums demands that communication be primarily on the 

theorists&rsquo; turf. The web might be an interesting site; a place 

where text files and sound files might be equally accessible. 

I&rsquo;d bet that more non-theorists would explore that than read 

any article in a scholarly journal. Likewise, the contentious 

analytical issues raised by Ethan Haimo&rsquo;s article might be 

illuminated on a website by hearing how the various aspects of 

the alternative analyses in that article highlighted different 

aspects of different performances.
</p>



<p>[16] And the neo-classical aspects that Martha Hyde cites in 

relating Schoenberg&rsquo;s Third String Quartet to Schubert&rsquo;s A-minor String Quartet could inspire a fascinating concert. How 

about having Martha invite a faculty string quartet to lunch to 

inspire them to program these two pieces side by side, having 

her attend rehearsals and interact with the performances (both 

by coaching them and learning about the performance traditions 

that performers bring to these works), and then give a pre-concert lecture to the audience at the performance. We will 

thereby create the musical equivalent of what adventurous 

museum curators do when they juxtapose stylistically clashing 

works in a gallery and communicate something interesting in a 

paragraph or two on the wall as we enter that room.
</p>



<p>[17] Such interactions will only arise if we come to believe 

that just publishing our latest conclusions in a journal is 

simply not enough. And such interactions will only arise if we 

think of the resulting interactions as more than using the 

performers, in effect, to perform the examples in our analysis. 

When we confront performers with our formidable verbal and 

analytical skills, they
often feel inadequate to challenge us 
on our turf. Do we ever consider that the inadequacies of 
performers in theoretical forums like classrooms are akin to 
the inadequacies that many of us would feel at the prospect of 
getting up in Carnegie Hall to perform in concert alongside 
accomplished performers?  These interactions will be most 
profitable and lead to a whole new climate of communication 
only if we listen to what performers do and then consider how 
their performance announces a structure different from the one 
we find in our analyses, and then consider the consequences of 
that circumstance.
</p>



<p>[18] To be sure, we have come a long way in dealing with 

analysis and performance. The past decade has seen a rapidly 

growing bibliography. And theorists active in that field 

believe that they are relating theoretical concerns to 

performers. But I am not sure that that is necessarily 

happening. I remember a conversation I had just about the year 

this society was formed with a well-known theorist at one of 

our major conservatories. There was talk of offering a course 

entitled &ldquo;Analysis for Performers&rdquo; in that conservatory, and 

this theorist, who had published numerous analyses, was having 

trouble conceiving of what would be included in that course. He 

commented, &ldquo;I guess I know a few instances where some hidden 

structure I&rsquo;ve found should be brought out by a performer. But 

that&rsquo;s not material enough to fill a course.&rdquo;
</p>



<p>[19] Too many theorists seem to believe that only when we find 

hidden structures or non-obvious aspects of structure are we 

doing &ldquo;real&rdquo; analysis. This focus causes us both to concentrate 

too often on hidden aspects of music, and at the same time to 

avoid other obvious areas that rarely seem to catch our 

attention, even though they are quite often central to 

performers.
</p>



<p>[20] For instance, until David Beach called attention in print 

a few years ago to Mozart&rsquo;s repeated use of a major III chord 

as an important goal of development sections in several of his 

pieces, the progression&mdash;one not at all uncommon&mdash;was hardly 

mentioned in harmony texts.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Harmony texts tend to include 

primarily or even exclusively what the author&rsquo;s theoretical 

perspective explains best. And amid the tonal norms of root 

progressions by fifth and passing and neighboring motions, the 

major III progressing to I in major keys&mdash;with its unresolved 

chromaticism and weak root progression&mdash;is indeed absent from 

or at best marginalized in many texts. Beach&rsquo;s theoretical 

instincts were therefore certainly correct when he called 

attention to a usage largely ignored in the theoretical 

literature. 
</p> 


 
<p>[21] Beach&rsquo;s analyses tend to normalize uses of major III as a 

goal&mdash;to show how despite the uncommon surface progressions it 

often engenders, those development sections nonetheless express 

(albeit in rather hidden fashion) the underlying dominant-to-tonic that sonata-form theory teaches us should be expressed in 

Classical-era development sections leading into 

recapitulations.
</p>



<p>[22] But what does that sort of analysis say to a performer who
must play those developments?  There is a very long-standing
performance pedagogy tradition that probably stretches well back
into the nineteenth century to treat appearances of chromaticism
in Mozart&rsquo;s largely diatonic surfaces as opportunities for highly
expressive performance nuances.  I know that I was coached in
that tradition in the 1950s by performers who were born early in
our century and who related that they learned it from their
teachers.  Aware performers have probably been nuancing
performances of that progression and exploring its directionality
for many generations.  Should they perform those development
sections as if they were like ones that end on the dominant?
</p>



<p>[23] And how should we deal with all those other progressions 

that precede tonic arrivals and thematic returns in Classical 

repertoire? Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; Quartet in C major from the op. 

76 set ends its first-movement development on a <i>minor</i> iii 

triad; and the middle part of the outer sections of the F-major 

slow movement of Mozart&rsquo;s D-minor String Quartet ends on a D-major chord followed by a first-inversion C triad before a 

tonic return in F. Again, I am not aware of any harmony text 

that discusses how the dominant of ii can lead directly to V.
</p>



<p>[24] Because such progressions only occur in occasional pieces, 

they have largely been ignored by harmony texts, whereas other 

progressions that are ubiquitous&mdash;although by no means of any 

greater theoretical interest on their own merits (I think 

of the cadential <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, for instance)&mdash;are the object of long 

theoretical controversies. But for generations every string 

quartet that plays these Haydn and Mozart war-horses has been 

dealing with how to articulate and color and pace these 

progressions. Far too rarely do analysts&mdash;in addition to 

checking the theoretical literature for references to previous 

analyses&mdash;research recordings of a piece to study the various 

ways that performers have dealt with a given passage.
</p>




<p>[25] The same issues might arise from history-of-theory 

discussions. This is a field that has truly blossomed in the 

past decade. When I was in graduate school, there was no way to 

read the works of Rameau in any language unless your university 

library happened to own a copy of his works in their original 

eighteenth-century editions. Now, thanks to reprints, to a 

broad range of new research, and to anthologies such as Ian 

Bent&rsquo;s two volumes of 19th-century analyses, we have ready 

access to numerous earlier perspectives on musical structure 

and on individual pieces.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The possibilities are virtually 

endless for imaginative interactions with performers and 

audiences based on these materials, especially if we add to the 

mix historical recordings now so readily available on CDs. 

Reading an analysis of an earlier era, listening to a recording 

of a performer who was born in the nineteenth century, and 

considering more recent analyses along with working with modern 

performers<nobr> . . . </nobr>just think of the interactions that would 

result.
</p>



<p>[26] And the same issue affects twentieth-century music. Our 

task when we analyze the atonal repertoire is most often to 

show connections. So we analyze Webern&rsquo;s op. 11 cello and piano 

pieces&mdash;pieces with notoriously unconnected surfaces&mdash;with the 

same tools we apply to the fourth of his <i>Movements For String 

Quartet</i> from the op. 5 set, where it is hard to find a single 

note that is not part of ubiquitously recurring figures and 

pitch-class sets. But cellists who have played both pieces know 

well that the performance issues of one and the other are 

strikingly different.
</p>



<p>[27] Underlying many of these examples are the topics that 

postmodernism in general and the New Musicology in particular 

have been raising, and how they affect our theoretical 

enterprise.
 There are scholars in those fields who argue that 
all our assertions of structuralism are out-dated, and that even 
if we believe that composers and performers intended to create 
and project organic and unified structures, that does not mean 
that organicism and structuralism are anything more than 
chimeras. 
Yet much if not most of our whole theoretical 
enterprise is built upon notions of organicism, structuralism, 
and intentionalism. When we analyze music, we are uncovering 

communicative elements&mdash;often organic and structural 

relationships&mdash;that were put there by a human being.
</p>



<p>[28] What often strikes me when I move between the world of 

contemporary musical scholarship and the world of performers is 

how little all these discussions&mdash;our analyses, our history-of-theory research, all the other topics we deal with, and our 

interactions with post-structuralism&mdash;have changed the world of 

performers. To be sure, performance traditions and habits have 

changed&mdash;dramatically in many ways&mdash;over the generations. What 

was a chic way of performing Bach or Mozart or Beethoven a 

generation or two ago is no longer acceptable. Yet when I speak 

to performance teachers or visit master classes, I find that 

virtually nothing has changed from the way most performance 

teachers communicated to their students from generations ago.
</p>



<p>[29] But in another sense everything has changed. These 

traditions of performers teaching younger performers arose in a 

vibrant culture in which composers, performers, amateur 

musicians, audiences, and patrons all interacted with one 

another to produce the works that now form the canon. But now 

the concert repertoire is largely a museum of works over a 

century old. There are many crises in the world of performance&mdash;not only the crises that hit the headlines: about graying 

audiences and greedy stars and concert promoters. A crisis that 

I worry about is whether we are properly educating a new 

generation of musicians. Because of the distractions of the 

modern world and the diminution in elementary and high school 

curricula of many traditional topics, young musicians today 

have fewer connections than ever to the past cultures in which 

the concert repertoire was created; and many young musicians 

are from parts of the world that have little historical 

connection with Europe and European culture. And this is 

happening as actuarial realities sever our last living links 

with the synergies of the past. Our students will transmit to 

the future the musical culture to which we devote our 

professional, if not our personal lives.
</p>



<p>[30] A second crisis I worry about&mdash;and one quite closely 

related to this first&mdash;is the increasing uniformity of 

performance styles. Part of the reason that consumers are not 

flooding the audio market to buy the latest recordings of this 

or that sonata, string quartet, or symphony is that so many 

performers seem to sound so much alike. The sorts of 

interactions that I suggested earlier could well be an avenue 

to showing this younger generation how learning to mix 

theoretical and performance expertise will allow them to 

develop individual performance styles and find themselves 

artistically.
</p>



<p>[31] In summary, I strongly believe that if our discoveries and 

controversies are not to be merely scholastic, we must find 

ways of communicating with other musicians not merely by 

announcing our positions, but by engaging other musicians on 

level playing fields. I have focused here on analysis and 

performance issues; but have also touched upon issues of 

Schoenberg scholarship, analytic approaches to atonal music, 

issues of intentionality, and the history of theory. I could 

extend this list to most other areas of theoretical endeavor.
</p>



<p>[32] One of the great joys of having been the editor of <i>Music 

Theory Spectrum</i> for the past three years is that it forced me 

to do something I haven&rsquo;t been forced to do since graduate 

school: read essays covering the entire breadth of the field. I 

can&rsquo;t think of a single article or review in <i>Spectrum</i> in 

those past three years that could not inspire interesting 

interactions with other musicians. For instance, Peter 

Westergaard&rsquo;s ode to musical space and Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s review-essay on semiotics raise very different sorts of issues of 

musical meaning, but they all suggest questions about how one 

would one play or hear a piece or passage of the music of an 

historical era differently as a result of these focuses.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>



<p>[33] But at the risk of wearing out my welcome here by 

repeating myself, I don&rsquo;t see such interactions happening if we 

insist that communication between theorists and other musicians 

must be in theoretical terms. I hope that this insistence is 

one of those immaturities that our field will grow past. For it 

will take mature confidence in what we do&mdash;not adolescent 

assertiveness&mdash;to communicate with other musicians as equals, 

not as pretended superiors.
</p>



<p>[34] I fully realize that many things we do as theorists may 

well be solely of interest to other theorists. We try on meta-musical ideas; we build systems; and so forth. But ultimately, 

if these ideas and systems are to apply to something other than 

themselves, we must be the ones to communicate them to other 

musicians.
</p>

<p>[35] I remember reading an essay by Jacques Barzun in the New 

York Times Sunday Book Review about a quarter century ago. 

Barzun related how when he was young, what passed for literary 

criticism in the most erudite of scholarly journals was quite 

pertinent to readers of literature. He lamented that what had 

come to be called literary criticism no longer bore any 

relation to the reading of books. If anything, the trend in 

that direction has accelerated considerably in the twenty-five 

years since.
</p>



<p>[36] Just as much contemporary literary theorizing seems to 

have little to do with reading and writing, much of the music-theoretical literature I read is far too little directed to 

creating, performing, and listening to music&mdash;even when the 

import of those articles and books is indeed quite pertinent to 

those activities. We as theorists should, I believe, 

communicate our discoveries, whenever possible, in discourse 

relevant to performers, composers, and listeners.
</p>



<p>[37] One closing anecdote: In the year that our society was 

formed, a theorist who held advanced degrees in both 

performance and theory remarked to me that he no longer wished 

to be called a performer&mdash;&ldquo;Theory is a legitimate field that 

needs to be respected,&rdquo; he asserted, &ldquo;and by insisting on 

calling myself a theorist, I am making a statement.&rdquo; I replied, 

&ldquo;Why not call yourself a musician?&rdquo;</p>
