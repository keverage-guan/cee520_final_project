<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] My paper is about pedagogy.  At first I take a relatively
traditional view of the term:  I will be addressing how we teach our
students.  Later I shall view pedagogy in broader terms, by discussing
how we teach ourselves, each other, and those colleagues and musicians
outside of the research field who peer in on us from time to time.
</p>

<p>[2] My contribution is inspired in part by Patrick McCreless&rsquo;s
recently published paper, &ldquo;Rethinking Contemporary Music Theory.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Among other topics, McCreless addresses the relationship between
speculative and practical theory.  He notes that this relationship has
at times been one of severe disjunction, at other times one of close
alliance.  In music theory&rsquo;s current efflorescence in the late
twentieth-century academy, McCreless suggests that the
speculative/practical dichotomy is translated into one between
research and pedagogy.  Although most music theorists practice both
activities, a boundary divides them.  Introductory pedagogical
practice is guided less by current research in music theory than by
the speculative theory of past centuries.  In the twentieth century,
these concepts&mdash;octave equivalence, acoustic generation, harmonic
function, formal prototypes&mdash;have run deep grooves in the pavement,
grooves which much current introductory pedagogy retraces.
</p>

<p>[3] When I first entered the field as a graduate student in 1979, the
boundary between research and teaching at the introductory levels
seemed inevitable and unbreachable.  At that time, the most
progressive and stimulating concepts in the field&mdash;middleground
motivic parallelisms, dissonant prolongations, double-tonic complexes,
Kh-networks, and hexachordal combinatoriality&mdash;were embedded in
distinct repertories.  Grasping these concepts required a saturation
in the respective repertories, and then a long walk through
preparatory concepts.
</p>

<p>[4] I think we are at a somewhat different juncture now.  A number of
central concepts have emerged in the last fifteen years that can be
taught at the introductory level, to students whose only prior
exposure is some familiarity with basic notation.  In identifying some
of these areas, my primary purpose is not to advocate for a particular
approach to pedagogy, but rather to establish a position from which to
observe the state of music theory as a research field.  I will suggest
that the opportunity to transgress the boundary between introductory
teaching and research reflects other ways that music theorists have
been recently crossing boundaries&mdash;boundaries between repertories,
between compositional parameters, and between domains of knowledge.  I
will suggest further that these circumstances provide an opportunity
to develop a more effective broader pedagogy.
</p>

<p>[5] I will now proceed through an imaginary syllabus for the first six
units of an introductory course in the fundamentals of music in the
European tradition.  Course pre-requisite:  ability to &ldquo;read music,&rdquo;
i.e. to passively interpret standard pitch/duration symbols in treble
and bass clefs.
</p>

<p>[6] When an oral version of this paper was presented at the Plenary
Session in Phoenix, my &lsquo;pedagogical program&rsquo; provoked some irritation
among a subset of those present, so I reiterate, with some emphasis,
that my intention is not to prescribe how music theory ought to be
taught, nor even to recommend a particular pedagogical program, but
rather, to call attention to the pedagogability of recent music
theory&mdash;the <i>potential</i> for its central concepts to be explained to a
population who has not made a substantial prior investment in
conceptual or repertorial overhead&mdash;and to use this circumstance as a
mirror for reflecting back on the current state of research in the
field.
</p>

<p>[7] UNIT 1. Rhythm and Meter.  After reviewing rhythmic notation,
establishing the concept of metric hierarchy, and introducing the
strong-beat oriented durational patterns most characteristic of
art-music and its pedagogy, we turn to the topic of funky rhythms.
The concept, but not the name, comes from the work of Jeff Pressing;
he calls them &ldquo;prime-generated.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> A prime-generated durational
pattern recursively applies a durational value that is co-prime with
the durational span that separates successive downbeats.  An example
is the dotted eight-note value in &ldquo;common&rdquo; time.  Upon reaching the
end of a measure, the generating value wraps back to the beginning of
the measure and continues to occupy empty beats until approximately
half of the available beat-classes are occupied.  The method is
cumbersome to explain, but, in my experience, not difficult for
students to intuit from example.  Among those patterns generated are
bell patterns characteristic of West African music, and musics of the
African diaspora.  These include, of course, many of the musics of the
United States and their further dissemination in trans-national
popular genres.
</p>

<p>[8] The concept of funky rhythms creates an opportunity to pay a visit
to some students in their musical homes, and in so doing to
demonstrate that productive systematic inquiries into musical
organization are not the province of Western European art music alone.
But there is another virtue as well:  prime generativity is
characteristic of pitch as well as of rhythm, and thus provides a
lead-in to future topics.  As Pressing shows, pentatonic and diatonic
scales in chromatic space, and triads and seventh chords in diatonic
space, are all prime generated, and thus isomorphic with funky
rhythms.
</p>

<p>[9] UNIT 2. Scales.  Diatonic scales are over-determined, and this
presents a pedagogical advantage.  They can be prime-generated by the
interval of the perfect fourth, as Schenker taught.  Or they can be
taught, perhaps more practically, as a series of whole and half-steps,
where the position of the half-steps is governed by the principle of
<i>maximal evenness</i>.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Clough and Douthett&rsquo;s concept is easily
intuited, in part because it seems to operate commonly in the physical
and social world.  Indeed, Douthett has recently shown its application
to the behavior of gas molecules.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> More to the pedagogical point,
maximal evenness seems to predict the position of individuals on
elevators.
</p>

<p>[10] UNIT 3. The Tonic Triad as Melodic Frame.  We begin this unit by
partitioning the diatonic scale into triadic and non-triadic tones.
This partition is both prime-generated and maximally even; the latter
concept will eventually serve to underwrite the complementarity of
steps and leaps, i.e., of voice-leading and harmony, as emphasized in
Eytan Agmon&rsquo;s work.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> For now, our concern is with studying stock
melodic figures that neighbor and pass between degrees of the tonic
triad.  Here three linked concepts introduced by Steve Larson are
useful:  inertia, magnetism, and gravity.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Together, these terms help
characterize fundamental psychological states of expectation and
fulfillment prompted by basic melodic figures and their
concatenations.
</p>

<p>[11] UNIT 4. Two-Voice Counterpoint.  We begin our study by
partitioning harmonic intervals into dissonance and consonance, and
further partitioning the latter category into imperfect and perfect.
We then study the syntactic model that leads dissonance to imperfect
consonance to perfect consonance.  The progression toward perfection
and the cadential status of the perfect intervals are both
psychologically clarified and historically situated through the
Aristotelean notion that the imperfect strives for the perfect, and
through the adaptation of these concepts to Christian theology by
Scholasticist philosophers.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>

<p>[12] UNIT 5. Triadic Voice-Leading in Root Position.  Having studied
triads as the stable ingredients of a diatonic collection, it is time
to learn the twenty-four consonant triads as individual entities, and
to begin to explore inter-triadic voice-leading, restricted for the
moment to root position.  We introduce the <i>Verwandtschaftstabelle</i> of
19th-century German theory, but adapted to equal temperament.  Motion
through the table proceeds by stepwise displacement of a single voice,
moving in oblique or contrary motion with the bass.  The pedagogy here
is rooted in the neo-Riemannian work of David Lewin and Brian Hyer.
The incremental moves are Lewin&rsquo;s Leitton, Parallel, and Relative
operations, the charting of these operations on an equal-tempered
version of Riemann&rsquo;s map is inspired by Brian Hyer&rsquo;s work, and the
focus on voice-leading parsimony has been the focus of my own recent
research.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>

<p>[13] UNIT 6. Talking About Music.  Having spent an intense few weeks
learning to talk about music, it&rsquo;s a good time to spend some time
examining the language that we&rsquo;ve been using.  In speaking of Maximal
Evenness, we appealed to a notion of objects in space.  We studied
melodic succession by analogy with physical motion.  For dissonance
and consonance, we invoked theology; for voice-leading parsimony, we
quietly appropriated a central concept from logic and economics.  When
we spoke of melody as adhering to principles of inertia, magnetism,
and gravity, we did not mean to imply that acoustic phenomena have
weight, volume, and mass.  My own understanding of these matters has
been enriched by Thomas Christensen&rsquo;s study of Newtonian mechanics and
Enlightenment musical concepts;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> by the work of Janna Saslaw and
Lawrence Zbikowski on image schemata and cross-domain mapping;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> and
by the writings of Marion Guck, Judy Lochhead, Nicholas Cook,<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> and
others who have alerted me to the metaphorical nature of many concepts
whose source I would not have otherwise considered.  Discussion of
these matters in the classroom provides points of contact with other
questions that colleagues in other departments invite our students to
pose, and it provides the more flexible thinkers among them a
perspective that will help them deal with their frustrations at
encountering the poverty of language about music in the face of the
richness of musical experience.
</p>

<p>[14] The discussion of the metaphorical nature of musical language
marks the end of my hypothetical musical curriculum.  I turn now to a
consideration of what broader trends are reflected in the
circumstances that I have been outlining.  Here I return to the theme
of boundary crossings that I mentioned earlier.  The term has acquired
the aura of a buzzword lately, yet its prominence responds to
something very real:  the rapid migration of populations and the
expedited pace of communications.  Among those phenomena hurtling
through the ether are artistic artifacts, including musics.  On this
scale, the boundaries that music theorists have crossed in the last
fifteen years have been relatively modest ones, but they are
nonetheless significant to my theme.
</p>

<p>[15] First there are the boundaries between musical repertories within
the Western art music tradition.  Such boundary crossings are not
without precedent:  for example, the putative modernist wall of 1908
was long ago transgressed by Adele Katz and Felix Salzer in the one
direction, and in the less distant past by Benjamin Boretz and John
Clough in the other.  But Lewin&rsquo;s <i>Generalized Musical Intervals and
Transformations</i> has had a crucial and probably long-lasting impact on
problematizing the boundary between the atonal and tonal.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p>[16] Second are the boundaries between art music and popular music,
between Western and non-Western, between written and oral musical
traditions.  This is part of a broader trend away from an exclusive
focus on the aesthetic experience of the focused expert listener in
the sustained presence of the masterwork, and toward a regard for the
ordinary cognition of ordinary folks in the perhaps casual presence of
perhaps ordinary music.  I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the one has replaced
the other, but rather that the two orientations increasingly exist
side-by-side, so that our discourse about music now travels
effortlessly and perhaps tacitly along a continuum between them.  On
one end of this continuum is traditional analytic scholarship; on the
other end, work in music perception and cognition, and work by
scholars such as Jay Rahn and Kofi Agawu on popular and folk music
traditions.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>

<p>[17] The third transgressed boundary is intimately related to the
second.  It is the boundary between music and other human activities.
Again we can point to a substantial pre-history, including the work of
Zuckerkandl and Meyer in the 1950&rsquo;s, and Clifton in the 1970&rsquo;s.  But
the 1983 book of Lerdahl and Jackendoff, with its articulate advocacy
of a cognitive orientation and its compelling demonstration of the
general cognitive basis of musical grouping judgments, marked an
important moment when musical capacities began to be viewed in the
broader framework of mental life.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>

<p>[18] The transgression of these boundaries is, I think, connected to
the potential for eroding the boundary between research and pedagogy.
The concepts enumerated in my &lsquo;syllabus&rsquo; are style- and music-specific
to varying degrees, but all of them point arrows to other domains of
musical and human experience. Prime-generativity is powerful because,
as Pressing&rsquo;s evidence suggests, it crosses boundaries of musical
style, and even domains of musical organization. Maximal evenness,
inertia, and magnetism acquire their power because of their
applicability to phenomena in the physical and social world; parsimony
because it is a desideratum of logical and economic systems.  Whether
we take these arrows to represent an ontologically real connection is
a matter of preference and ideology.  From the perspective I am
adopting here, what matters is the heuristic job that each arrow
performs:  it provides a conduit for explanation, and such conduits are
central to the pedagogical process.
</p>

<p>[19] My essay so far has adopted a traditionally narrow view of
pedagogy, as the education of undergraduate students in the
classroom. But we don&rsquo;t only teach our students. We teach each
other&mdash;fellow practitioners of music theory in the Anglo-American
tradition&mdash;and we teach (and in turn are taught by) scholars and
musicians who locate themselves outside that tradition. I will not
attempt an analysis of our scholarly modes of discourse, but it is
worth observing that we seem to be collectively placing a higher value
on ushering each other incrementally into our private
thought-universes. I am thinking especially of the trend toward more
targeted deployment of sparser graphic images, in particular, the epic
story told by the arrow in Figure 0.1 of Lewin&rsquo;s GMIT, and the
technique for graphically transmitting analytic information developed
by Lewin in the <i>Four Analytical Essays</i> and in Henry Klumpenhouwer&rsquo;s
work.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>

<p>[20] The manner in which we address those outside our profession is
also changing. I have in mind here not only targeted pedagogical
works, such as those of Straus, Friedmann, and Morris, but also overt
works of outreach toward performers, such as Deborah Stein&rsquo;s book
(with Robert Spillman) on song, and original works of research that
make explicit attempts to maximize their audience when the topic
allows, such as the books on tonal rhythm by Joel Lester and William
Rothstein.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>

<p>[21] The increasing possibility of disseminating music-theoretic
insights, without huge investment in overhead, provides a number of
opportunities for a broadened audience, and a broadened set of
dialogues which can mold and inform our own practice. Some of these
dialogues have already begun.  The commerce between music theorists
and behavioral and cognitive scientists is already approaching a
healthy volume. This is the area of music theory that treats of
fundamental questions by its very nature, and the problem of
transmissability seems thereby less acute.  The communication gates
between music theorists and critical and cultural musicologists are
opening a bit more creakily, but the increasing volume and
sophistication of historical approaches to music theory will likely
oil these doors as a matter of course. The challenge here will be for
those of us who deal with problems that are analytic, or ahistorically
speculative, to communicate our insights in ways that other scholars,
trained in different traditions, will want to absorb them. Martha
Hyde&rsquo;s admonition from ten years ago is perhaps less urgent than it
was on that similarly commemorative occasion:  &ldquo;If we remain exclusive,
competing among ourselves, interested only in our own issues, reading
only our own journals, in ten years or twenty we may find that we have
conceded the real competition without knowing it, for in the meantime
younger music historians are going to be learning analysis&mdash;well
enough for their purposes if not for ours.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Volition furnishes
only a portion of the solution to Hyde&rsquo;s challenge. There is also an
aspect of communicative technique, analogous to that faced by the
&ldquo;human factors&rdquo; or &ldquo;user interface&rdquo; branch of computer science.  The
pedagogability of some aspects of recent music theory, to beginning
students, bodes well for its transmissability to peers across
intra-disciplinary boundaries.
</p>

<p>[22] There are two sets of boundaries, however, that we have only just
begun to permeate. One of them is work on non-Western music. As
repertorial boundaries erode, and Anglo-American music scholars become
increasingly aware that music is located in knowledge and behavior as
well as in authorized texts, the line that divides our work from
research on non-Western and non-classical repertories begins to seem
increasingly artificial. Is it possible that work now wearing the
jersey &ldquo;ethnomusicology,&rdquo; by scholars such as Paul Berliner, Simha
Arom, and Steven Feld, is no different in kind from work that sports
the colors of our own discipline?<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>

<p>[23] Here is a case that clearly outlines the issue.  In 1978,
archaeologists working in Southern China uncovered a tomb from 433 BC,
containing sixty-five bells. Each bell preserves not only its
acoustic properties but also contains an inscription characterizing
its function in various tonal systems.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> One might expect that the
level of interest that such a discovery might arouse in a scholarly
community that identifies its domain by conjoining the terms &ldquo;music&rdquo;
and &ldquo;theory&rdquo; might be tantamount to, say, that of a community of
astronomers upon the discovery of a new moon for Jupiter.  What does
it say about our discipline that, for the last twenty years, we
collectively yawned at or slept through this discovery, leaving its
exploration to the archaeologists and materials scientists?<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

<p>[24] The second boundary is one that divides music theory across
linguistic boundaries. There are increasing points of contact between
Anglophone theorists and those in Europe and elsewhere. Translations
of writings of Nattiez, Vieru, and others have revealed colleagues
spontaneously traveling along paths related to our own.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> A
particularly encouraging model of an international approach to
fundamental concerns was recently published in Italy. Loris Azzaroni&rsquo;s
<i>Canone Infinito</i> is striking both in that it combines two genres that
are distinct <i>chez nous</i>&mdash;it is both a first-year theory book, and an
introduction to advanced research in the field&mdash;and because it is
thoroughly international, mixing and mingling much of the best from
the American, British, German, Italian, and French theoretical
traditions.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>

<p>[25] Twenty years after the founding of its principal professional
society, North American music theory is less insular than it was, but
more insular than it need be. The pedagogability of many recent
concepts suggests that there are emerging opportunities to communicate
our best ideas in languages that can reach audiences beyond our
sub-disciplinary and linguistic borders, and that we may not even need
to work all that hard to meet those opportunities.</p>
