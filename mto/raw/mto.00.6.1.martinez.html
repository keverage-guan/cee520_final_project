very old tradition of musicological scholarship. Dating as early as the
beginning of the Christian era, there is a crescent number of extant treatises
in Sanskrit dealing with all aspects of music theory, musical practice, dance,
and aesthetics. Indian scholars, in combining studies on the technical and
aesthetical features of music, have made clear a semiotic preoccupation, that of
understanding the meaning of music. Conversely, we find in the treatises
attribution of meaning to ragas, talas, and musical forms, implying also a
normative function to the theory of music. However, what was established in the
treatises has not corresponded perfectly to the music as practiced in courts and
temples. New treatises were in constant demand of being composed to adjust the
theory with the current practice.</p>

<p>The Western scholarship on the music of India has often employed the methods
of ethnology. Yet, this approach has been poor in creating better understandings
on issues with which Indian scholars have been concerned for millennia&mdash;in
particular, the meaning of music. It is my view that the general theory of
signs, as proposed by Charles Peirce, can be used as a theoretical instrument
that gives to the analyst precise concepts for the study of musical
signification. The advantage of this approach consists in operating with a
system that enables the study of the traditional Indian music in accordance with
its own logic. However, I believe that, between the general theory of signs (a
normative science) and the subject matter&mdash;music (consisting of acoustic
relations and facts of culture)&mdash;there must be an intermediate theory, or an
applied theory&mdash;namely, a theory of musical semiotics. My purpose in this
conference is to demonstrate how Indian music was studied with the semiotics of
Peirce, the semiotic theory of music built for that, and the results thereof.</font></p>

<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Indian music has been developing for millennia on two simultaneous
courses. First, the performance-practice tradition, whose form of development is
the oral instructions imparted by guru to disciple. In Sanskrit, this is called <i>guru
shishya parampara</i>.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Second, there is the written tradition, or <i>shastric</i>, whose medium is the
scripted form of treatises, the study of which is also frequently held on a <i>guru-shishya</i>
basis. Both traditions can be thought as interrelated webs of musical
signification, for which I imply here a very broad conception of musical sign
and its signification process or semiosis.</p>

<p>[2] Music is a sign in itself, and the various ways of organizing musical
material can be viewed as forms of semiosis. Music, however conceived, has the
power of reference, and the objects it signifies range from pure musical
materiality, to entities (such as things, real or imaginary beings, persons, and
so on) and all forms of individual and cultural representations (again signs),
from emotions to political ideas. However, music could not exist if no one
interpreted it. Sign interpretation consists of the process of producing or
modifying an idea that the sign represents in reference to its object; such
production is semiosis itself. Musical interpretation involves perception and
cognition and all forms of aesthetic enjoyment. It is also the mental and
physical aspects of musical learning and performance. Musical interpretation is
certainly the basis of all music criticism and scholarship, and composition
would be impossible without it. Hence, musical semiosis, in general terms, is a
composite of significations, and its actuality depends necessarily on
interpretation. In considering the complexity of signification in all spheres of
musical activity, either in India or in other cultures, I realized the need not
only of tools for the application of semiotic concepts in musical analysis, but
also the need for understanding and distinguishing areas and relevant points of
view. This seems to me a very critical issue, for the results of a semiotic
analysis change utterly depending on the viewpoint and the focus of the study.
It was in the work of the American scientist and philosopher, Charles Sanders
Peirce, that I found the necessary instruments and theoretical framework to cope
with this project in an integrated and logically sound system.</p>

<p>[3] In Peirce&rsquo;s classification of the sciences, semiotics (or <i>semeiotic</i>)
has three branches: speculative grammar, critic and methodeutic (or speculative
rhetoric) (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b3fa">CP</a> 1.192).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> According to Nathan Houser, the scholar who studies speculative grammar deals
with the intrinsic nature of signs and semiosis. The scholar examines relations
among signs, the nature of the correlates taking part in semiosis, Peirce&rsquo;s sign
trichotomies, and his classes of sign. The study of critic deals with signs in
relation to their objects, and especially the condition of signs&rsquo; references in
relation to their signified objects. Methodeutic studies signs in relation to
their interpretants. Thus, semiosis is focused on the interpretant level, and
how interpretants themselves can become signs during semiotic processes (<a href="#houser_1990" id="citation_houser_1990_67dc9b8e4b411">Houser 1990</a> 210&ndash;11).</p>

<p>[4] It seems to me that, just as Peirce divided formal semiotics into three
areas, musical studies can also be understood as three interrelated fields, not
as broad and abstract as speculative grammar, critic and methodeutic are, but
still showing a concern for the following: (1) &ldquo;the general conditions of
signs being signs&rdquo; (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b413">CP</a> 1.444), that is, the intrinsic nature of semiosis,
or the study of signs and their systems of inner relationship; (2) &ldquo;the
theory of the general conditions of the reference of Symbols and other Signs to
their professed Objects&rdquo; (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b414">CP</a> 2.93), that is, the relation of signs to their
objects; and (3) &ldquo;the necessary conditions of the transmission of meaning
by signs from mind to mind, and from one state of mind to another&rdquo; (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b415">CP</a> 1.444), that is, the relation of signs to their interpretants, interpreters, and
systems of interpretation.</p>

<p>[5] Accordingly, the analytical model I propose comprises three interrelated
fields of inquiry. (1) <i>Intrinsic Musical Semiosis</i>, or the study of the
musical sign in itself, deals with internal musical signification. It
constitutes the semiotics of musical materiality. Intrinsic semiosis encompass
musical qualities, actualization of musical works, and the organizing habits of
music, such as musical systems. (2) <i>Musical Reference</i>, or the study of
musical signs related to their possible objects, deals with the musical
signification of a broad class of objects. This field investigates questions
such as how a musical sign refers to an object, the possible dynamical objects
represented by music and their modes of being, the possible relations between a
dynamical object and the immediate object as represented in the sign. (3) <i>Musical Interpretation</i>, or the study of the musical sign related to its
interpretants, deals with the action of musical signs in an existing or
potential mind. Issues of musical interpretation can be divided into three
sub-fields: (first) musical perception, (second) performance, and (a double
third) musical intelligence (analysis, criticism, teaching, theorizing and
musical semiotics) and composition. In my dissertation this theory was applied
to Hindustani classical music (<a href="#martinez_1997" id="citation_martinez_1997_67dc9b8e4b417">Martinez 1997</a>). Yet, it seems to me that it can be used as a model to analyze other musical traditions.</p>

<p>[6] Concerning relations among the three fields of semiotic inquiry, it
should be clear that musical interpretants depend on the musical signs in
themselves and how they refer to their objects; that is, musical interpretants
encompass intrinsic musical semiosis and musical reference. Musical reference,
by its turn, includes necessarily intrinsic musical semiosis. The logic of this
triadic relationship can be considered in the following diagram:</p>

<p>[7] We can reflect on some of these questions. The <b>Example 1</b> is a
transcription of a <i>calan</i>&mdash;a musical sketch&mdash;composed by D. C. Vedi for <i> raga
malkauns</i>. <i> Ragas</i> are fundamental structures of Indian music. They signify a range
of possible meanings, which can be studied from different perspectives. I will
briefly analyse some of those as a demonstration of the fields of semiotic
inquiry I have proposed.</p>

<p>[8] The field of <i>Intrinsic Musical Semiosis</i> deals with internal
musical signification. As a piece of music organized according to the principles
of the Hindustani <i>raga</i> system, this example observes the musical habits
(or legisigns) of <i>raga malkauns</i>. This <i>raga</i> is based on a
pentatonic pitch set, comprising a minor third, a minor sixth and a minor
seventh. The perfect fourth is an important degree, which takes part in several
motifs that characterize <i>malkauns</i>. Legisigns signify by means of their
actualizations (replicas or sinsigns), which&mdash;in Indian music&mdash;are somehow
flexible, because the performer improvises, choosing the sequence of a <i>raga</i>&rsquo;s
motifs, and producing variations for them during the concert itself. Further,
each <i>raga</i> has its peculiar musical qualities, and this is a matter of
qualisigns. In this field, sign and object are both of an acoustic nature.</p>

<p>[9] Concerning the field of <i>Musical Reference</i>, musical signs can stand
for both acoustic and non-acoustic objects. Firstly, in its immediacy, the
example can be understood as pure music. This happens when the listener
disregards, or ignores, all possible significations but the music itself.
Therefore, the listener considers the sign as representing merely sound
qualities and their relations. Its meaning is purely musical, and semiosis is
grounded on pure icons. Sign, object and interpretant are all musical qualities.
Yet any minimally informed listener will recognize that this is an example of
Indian music. Now, the sign is an index of the culture that produces this kind
of music. The interpretation reaches another level when the sign is understood
as a particular musical structure, <i>raga malkauns</i>, which stands for
several levels of signification. The representation is grounded on habit, and
thus the piece is a symbol. In this case, the interpretant has an essential
role, because a musical symbol requires from the listener a certain knowledge
that promotes its comprehension. Let us consider some of the objects that <i>malkauns</i>
has stood for.</p>

<p>[10] The oldest ancestor of <i>malkauns</i>, the <i>gramaraga malavakaishika</i>,
is described in the <i>Brhaddeshi</i>, a ninth-century treatise, as representing
love in separation and heroism (3.anu.200). Four hundred years later, in the <i>Sangitaratnakara</i>,
the same range of meanings is attributed to this <i>raga</i> (2.70d&ndash;73a). In the
17th century, however, <i>malavakaishika</i> is personalized as a fierce
warrior. Damodara, author of the <i>Sangitadarpana</i>, characterize this raga
as follows:</p>

<p> His mace running with blood, garlanded with the skulls of heroes, <i>Malavakaishika,</i>
surrounded by braves, and bravest of the brave! (2.60, Danielou&rsquo;s translation <a href="#danielou_1991" id="citation_danielou_1991_67dc9b8e4b527">1991</a>, 324).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[11] This change of meaning reflects also an aspect of musical signs. <i>Ragas</i>
have been evolving continuously and their multiplicity and vitality can be
compared with those of living creatures. Gradually through the centuries, <i>ragas</i>,
like generations of musical beings, evolved. New forms and meanings were born,
they became known and fashionable, and as time passed, old and obsolete, and
were to some extent replaced by new popular <i>ragas</i>. <i>Malavakaishika</i>&rsquo;s
significations continued to evolve, and in this century it is considered as a
great and solemn <i>raga</i>. For contemporary Indian musicians and scholars,
the character of <i>malkauns</i> is that of seriousness or peacefulness,
although there are still some references to heroism (see <a href="#martinez_1997" id="citation_martinez_1997_67dc9b8e4b538">Martinez 1997</a>, 315&ndash;17).
This brief historical account of a <i>raga</i> illustrates another aspect of
symbols, namely, that symbols have a life of their own, and their meaning and
use change along with a certain period of time.</p>

<p>[12] But are there any features in the musical legisigns of <i>malkauns</i>
that could ground the representation of seriousness or peacefulness? Yes, there
are several, for this <i>raga</i> signifies not on a conventional basis, but its
force, as a symbol, depends on the several iconic and indexical features
consecrated by habits. One important aspect of this <i>raga</i> is the tradition
of performing <i>malkauns</i> in a slow tempo and with a tendency to explore
rather the lower register. Thus, it is possible to identify here a feature of
similarity between the musical form of the <i>raga</i> and its character, which
is described as <i>gambhir</i>, that is, serious and grave. This representation
constitutes a kind of diagram, or iconic legisign, for the music presents in
itself qualities of movement similar to a type of character that can be found in
Indian literature, the serious and wise hero, whose movements are controlled and
solemn. Other aspects of <i>malkauns</i>, such as the slow glissando between the
tonic and fourth degree, and the graceful slow oscillation on the minor third
can also be thought as iconic of the <i>raga</i> character. The stability of <i>malkauns</i>
is also marked by the emphasis on the perfect fourth and its plagal relation
with the tonic, which functions as an indexical sign of the seriousness of the <i>raga</i>.</p>

<p>[13] <i>Musical Interpretation</i>, or the study of the musical sign related
to its interpretants, deals with the action of musical signs in an existing or
potential mind. The basic questions in this field are the nature of the musical
interpretant (emotional, energetic, logical); and how the sign determines the
interpretant (as a sign of possibility, or a rheme; as conveying some
information, or a dicent; or as in its character as a sign, or an argument).
Perception, performance, scholarship and composition are complex forms of
musical interpretants because they are the actual result of semiosis. This is
obviously clear in the case of perception. A musical sign reaches the hearing
sense and is interpreted as another sign in the mind of the listener, which is
further interpreted, and so on. The other three areas of musical interpretants
result not from a single instance of perception, but from a cultural-dialogical
process of semiosis. Perception starts the process that leads to the causation
of musical signs, such as: performed music and compositions, as well as
treatises and conferences. This is certainly the most complex and broad field of
musical semiotic inquiry and I will rather address here one of its
sub-divisions, that of musical intelligence, or the <i>shastric</i> tradition of
Indian music.</p>

<p>[14] Lewis Rowell distinguishes two modes by which Indian thought has been
organized (<a href="#rowell_1992" id="citation_rowell_1992_67dc9b8e4b53a">1992</a>, 27&ndash;34): (1) Systematic thinking, represented by the six
orthodox schools of philosophy (<i>Nyaya</i>, <i>Vaisheshika</i>, <i>Sankhya</i>,
<i>Yoga</i>, <i>Mimamsa</i>, <i>Vedanta</i>), as well as the <i>Tantra</i> and <i>Kashmiri
Shaivism</i>; and (2) Symbolic thinking, represented by metaphors, tales,
sayings, and the like. I would instead refer to the second group as kinds of
analogical thinking (if not iconic thinking), and postulate another class, that
of empirical (or indexical) thinking. Therefore, with a semiotic rearrangement,
these classes are as follows: (1) analogical thinking, (2) empirical thinking
and (3) systematic thinking.</p>

<p>[15] Analogical thinking in Hindustani music intelligence, in which tales and
metaphors are used instead of experimental or systematic reasoning, constitutes
a truly heuristic mode, a characteristic feature of iconic semiosis (see <a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b53c">CP</a> 3.363, 3.641). Analogical thinking is fundamental to all forms of reasoning.
Peirce writes that &ldquo;the act of inference consists in the thought that the
inferred conclusion is true because <i>in any analogous case</i> an analogous
conclusion <i>would be</i> true&rdquo; (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b53d">CP</a> 5.130). The <i>Natyashastra</i>, the
oldest treatise on music, dance and drama, composed by the third century A.D.,
presents an interesting description of how drums were conceived:</p>

<blockquote>

<p> During a break
from studies, in the rainy season, Svati once went to a lake to fetch water.
After his having gone to the lake, Pakashasana (Indra), by [sending] great
torrential rains, commenced to make the world one [vast] ocean. Then in this
lake, torrents of water falling with the force of wind made clear sounds on the
lotus leaves. Now the sage, hearing suddenly this sound produced by torrents of
rain, considered it to be a wonder and observed it carefully. After observing
the high, medium and low sounds produced on the lotus-leaves as deep, sweet and
pleasing, he went back to his hermitage. And after arriving there, he devised
the <i>Mrdangas</i>, and then the <i>Pushkaras</i> [like] <i>Panavas</i> and <i>Darduras</i>
[with the help of] <i>Vishvakarman</i>. On seeing the <i>Dundubhi</i> of gods,
he made <i>Muraja</i>, <i>Alingya</i>, <i>Urdhvaka</i> and <i>Ankika</i>. Then,
he, who was a master of reasoning of the positive and the negative kind, covered
these and <i>Mrdanga</i>, <i>Dardura</i> and <i>Panava</i> with hide, and bound
them with strings.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> (33.5&ndash;13)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[16] The description does not seem to be purely mythological, but a true case
of iconic inference and insight, that is, an analogical abduction. The lotus
leaves, an image of the tight skin of drums, hit by falling raindrops, function
iconically as drums. The text above suggests that the principle of variation of
pitch was also discovered by Svati&rsquo;s observation, for he probably inferred that
differences in the diameter of the leaves produced sounds of high, medium, and
low frequencies.</p>

<p>[17] When considering empirical thought as a form of musical interpretants, I
am concerned with inductive reasoning in the description of musical elements and
structures, as well as some forms of experimental methods. A classical example
is the two vinas experiment described in the <i>Natyashastra</i> (28.24),
intended to demonstrate the existence of 22 micro-intervals, or <i>shrutis</i>.
It is a truly experimental approach, rather rare in Indian musicology. A much
later scholar, Ahobala-pandita (17th century), described in the treatise <i>Sangita-parijata</i>
the octave relation, as well as the seven diatonic notes and their intervallic
relations, in terms of string division and the position of nodes corresponding
to the harmonic partials (see <a href="#ranade_1951" id="citation_ranade_1951_67dc9b8e4b540">Ranade 1951</a> 177&ndash;78).</p>

<p>[18] Another aspect of empirical thinking concerns the way Indian music
theory changed in respect of the constantly evolving musical practice. The
classification of <i>ragas</i> evolved according to the expansion of musical
practice. The <i>grama-jati</i> system (see the <i>Natyashastra</i>), in use
from the early centuries A.D. to the fifth century, were supplanted by the <i>gramaragas</i>,
which evolved from the seven primary <i>gramaragas</i> to a number of 33. But
this system was not closed and some 100 other structures, the <i>bhashas</i>, or
dialects, were related to the older <i>gramaragas</i> (see the <i>Brhaddeshi</i>).
Even the <i>bhashas</i> became aged, and by the late first and early second
millennium another system was created by scholars, in order to cope with the new
regional <i>deshiragas</i> (see the <i>Sangitaratnakara</i>). Little by little,
more <i>ragas</i> were created and classification systems were put in check. By
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a paradigmatic change had occurred. By
means of analogical thinking, scholars started classifying <i>ragas</i> into
families, quite like the extended Indian family (see the <i>Sangitadarpana</i>).
Those were known as the <i>raga-ragini</i> systems. A male <i>raga</i> headed a
group of five or six wives, the <i>raginis</i>. However, Hindustani music
continued to develop progressively, and it was necessary to incorporate new <i>ragas</i>
into the systems. Thus, related to the wives, there appeared the <i>raga</i>
sons, and then the sons&rsquo; wives. Finally, the continuous flow of new structures
made the system itself obsolete, and scholars started looking for a new, more
capacious system of <i>raga</i> classification. The result was the <i>mela</i>
systems of the 17th century (see the <i>Ragavibddha</i> in Nijenhuis 1976), and
the Hindustani <i>that</i> system of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (see
Bhatkhande), both based on scale-type classification.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The aspect of empirical reasoning in all these systems relates to the fact that scholars were, over the course of centuries, forced to recognize that old systems had become incommensurable with current practice, and that either the system would have to be extended in some way, or another paradigm invented.</p>

<p>[19] Some traits of systematic thinking in Indian musical scholarship can be
equated to general aspects of Indian thought. First, there is an authoritative
character in scholarship, a deep sense of valuing traditions. Lannoy writes that
&ldquo;It is virtually an axiom of Indian culture that the oldest is best&rdquo;
(<a href="#lannoy_1971" id="citation_lannoy_1971_67dc9b8e4b550">1971</a>, 272). The <i>Natyashastra</i>, as the oldest extant treatise, has an
authority similar to that of the <i>Vedas</i>, even being qualified as the fifth
<i>Veda</i>. Second, in its transition from a habit of thinking totally
dependent on oral transmission to the written form of treatises, the early, very
concise sutras&mdash;written on palm leaves&mdash;were commented on and amplified with
other leaves inserted into the batch, which in turn were commented on again,
copied as a single unitary work, glossed again, and so on. Thus, on one hand,
there is the encyclopedic character of treatises; and on the other hand was the
commentarial aspect of the writings. The latter became a literary genre of its
own, the <i>bhashya</i>.</p>

<p>[20] The advent of Islamic rule in North India did not essentially change the
musical systems and scholarship. It is true that new forms, styles, and
instruments were introduced, but all those were assimilated into the mainstream
of Indian music. In terms of musical intelligence, there is plenty of evidence
of the interest which Muslim rulers took in Indian music. Gangoly writes that
&ldquo;the Moghul patrons took care to ascertain accurately the fundamental
principles of Indian musical science, before proceeding to help towards its
further growth and enrichment. And for this purpose, more than one authoritative
treatise in Sanskrit was translated into Persian as the basis of a scientific
investigation&rdquo; (<a href="#gangoly_1989" id="citation_gangoly_1989_67dc9b8e4b551">1989</a>, 141). It may be said that Persian &ldquo;ethnomusicologists&rdquo; were at work in the Moghul courts, but in fact ethnomusicology in India is much older. There is evidence that the <i>gramaragas</i> were known in Central Asia by the 6th century (see <a href="#widdess_1995" id="citation_widdess_1995_67dc9b8e4b553">Widdess 1995</a>, 15&ndash;18), and this was certainly thanks to the spread of musical scholarship by musicians and travelers, as Husuan-tsang, a Chinese who traveled in India for fifteen years in the seventh century collecting Buddhist sutras.</p>

<p>[21] Musical conferences were another scholarly practice that influenced
systematic thought. Many treatises were composed as result of those conferences.
The <i>Sangitashiromani</i>, for instance, was written in 1428 by a group of
scholars invited to the court of Sultan Malika Shahi. It is also known that Raja
Man Singh Tomar, king of Gwalior (ruled between 1486&ndash;1516), organized a musical
conference, headed by Nayak Bakhshu, which resulted in the composition of a
treatise in Brajbhasha entitled <i>Manakutuhala</i>, unfortunately no longer
extant (see Faqirullah). The musical conferences organized early in the present
century by Bhatkhande were very important in helping classical Indian music to
survive in the context of new social and political realities. The conferences
represent clearly the idea of semiosis as developing in a community of
inquirers, an aspect of scientific thought valued by Peirce: &ldquo;Let us
remember that science is a pursuit of living men, and that its most marked
characteristic is that when it is genuine, it is in an incessant state of
metabolism and growth&rdquo; (<a href="#cp_cp" id="citation_cp_cp_67dc9b8e4b554">CP</a> 1.232). Several features of Indian musical
intelligence discussed above represent superbly the Peircean idea of the growth
of symbols&mdash;an organic, overwhelming and never-ending growth&mdash;which, thanks to
the work of musicians, such as Ravi Shankar, Hariprasad Chaurasia and Zakir
Hussain, and several scholars, Indian classical music became known, studied,
practiced, and enjoyed worldwide, giving its rich contribution to the musical
heritage of mankind. Thank you.</p>
