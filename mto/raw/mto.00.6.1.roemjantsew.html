<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The year 1999 has been an important one in the field of Music Theory; two
public events have taken place: in February the inaugural conference of the new
Dutch Society for Music Theory was held at the Amsterdam School of Music, and in
October the Fourth European Music Analysis Conference took place in Rotterdam.
These two events underscore a development that started with the foundation of
the Magazine for Music Theory (<i>Tijdschrift voor Muziektheorie</i>) almost
five years ago. Without a network of national and international contacts it is
nearly impossible to keep in touch with the developments in the professional
field. As in the rest of Europe, those employed in the music-theoretical field
have been functioning without a structured and specialized forum or platform.
From 1989 onwards the French <i>Societe Francaise d&rsquo;analyse musicale</i> has
served as an example for numerous European countries in which societies for
music theory have been founded since. The main purpose of these societies is to
develop the music-analytical component within the professional and scientific
field of music. Due to the division between music education at conservatories
and schools of music and the education at universities, and along this line
between musical practice and musical research, development of the music-analytical component has not been a major priority in The Netherlands, nor in
some other European countries. Music theory and analysis serve a purpose mainly
within the curricula of conservatories and schools of music where they are part
of undergraduate or pedagogical courses, whereas research generally takes place
at the musicology departments of universities.</p>
<p>[2] The main purpose of the inaugural conference of the new Dutch (and
Flemish) Society for Music Theory, which took place on February 12 and 13, was
to discuss and investigate the daily practice of the educational system at
conservatories and schools of music in the Netherlands and Belgium. Another
important aspect was to place music theory within an international perspective;
to view music theory within a broader scope is one of the purposes of the
Society for Music Theory. The practice within education was the focus during
sessions on harmony and eartraining methods. During another session attention
was drawn to possible changes due to the developments in the field of
information-technology. Two projects based on computer-supported education were
presented: the Music Web, of which one of the initiating institutions is the
Royal Conservatory in The Hague, and UniSono, a project initiated by the
Catholic University of Leuven, the Lemmens Institute and the Royal Conservatory
in Brussels. The institutional status of music theory as a subject, its place in
relation to musical practice on the one hand and to musicology on the other
hand, was the point of departure for the lectures of Mark Delaere (Professor at
the Musicology Department of Catholic University Leuven) and Ludwig Holtmeier
(Associate Professor at the Hanns Eisler Hochschule fuer Musik in Berlin). Part
of the above mentioned lectures was formed by discussion about the repertoire
that is being focused on; music theory has been mainly developed along with and
based on Western classical music from about 1700 till 1900. In recent years,
however, a start has been made to focus on other styles and genres as well. This
focus was underlined by sessions on Indian music and on Jazz; Barbara London&rsquo;s (Berklee
College, USA) lecture on Jazz Harmony illustrated this focal point. Her lecture
also took place within another frame, namely, international contacts. Another
international session was represented by Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s lecture on
&ldquo;analysis and performance-practice.&rdquo; In his lecture Nicholas Cook
explained the relevance of comparing two versions of Brahms&rsquo; Piano Trio Opus 8.
His lecture was related to a performance of the Trio, and interaction with the
performers was established by explaining and studying the two scores with them.
After his lecture two Dutch theorists, Paul Scheepers and Hans Maas responded by
showing their point of view on a specific part of Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s lecture.</p>
<p>[3] One hundred four participants attended the inaugural conference of the
Society for Music Theory. All conservatories--eleven Dutch and four Flemish--and
the universities of Amsterdam, Groningen, Leuven and Utrecht were represented.
Based on these numbers alone the conference can be regarded as successful. But
it is not only statistics and the fact that the conference has been organized
that count; more important are the reactions, responses and contacts of and
between those working within the music-theoretical field. Having established
the foundation for further developments, the possibility has been created to
further improve the circumstances of a music-theoretical network and to continue
discussing and advancing the curriculum at conservatories within The
Netherlands.</p>
<p>[4] From October 21&ndash;24 the 4th European Music Analysis Conference took place
at the Rotterdam Conservatory. During those four days 153 representatives of 62
institutions (conservatories, schools of music, and universities) from 16
different countries (Belgium, Germany, England, Austria, France, Spain, Italy,
Greece, Suisse, Poland, Ukraine, United States, Canada, Israel, Australia and
the Netherlands) attended the conference. The purpose of the conference was to
connect and investigate the various streams within analysis in Europe, and to
trace the traditions of these streams. The participants were given the
opportunity to learn from each other by sharing their points of view while
discussing and reflecting. A broad scope of analytical methods like those of
Riemann, Schoenberg, Schenker, Tovey, and more recent methods like pitch-class
set theory, neo-Schenkerian techniques, computer-based analysis, and analysis
of performances were to be found among the various lectures. Remarkable was the
fact that semiotic analysis (Nattiez) was not discussed. The diversity in
analytical approaches turned out to be a specific European aspect, whereas in
English-speaking countries most methods are based on Schenkerian analysis for
tonal music, and on pitch-class set theory for atonal music. The difference
between Europe and the English-speaking countries turned out to be an important
theme during the conference, and it will continue to be during the next (5th)
EuroMAC in Bristol (UK) in 2002. One of the general purposes of the conference
was to connect music theorists and musicologists; this purposes became extended
by the possibility to meet with the participants of the Gaudeamus competition
(an international competition for contemporary music); the participants of the
competition were offered the possibility to attend the various sessions.</p>
<p>[5] Following is a selection of topics of the sessions. &ldquo;Vestiges of an
Early Style: On Varese&rsquo;s First Version of <i>Amerique</i>&rdquo; by Dieter Nanz
(Austria). The point of departure in Nanz&rsquo; paper was the comparison of the first
version (1918&ndash;1922) of Varese&rsquo;s <i>Amerique</i> (of which the score had been
reconstructed by Klaus Augermann in 1990) with the final version of 1927. In
&ldquo;Temporal plasticity in Beethoven&rsquo;s Bagatelles Opus 126 No. 1 and 6,&rdquo;
Frank Samarotto (USA) showed a comparison of the various planes of a composition
and the way perspective is applied in some paintings.</p>
<p>[6] Various sessions on Ligeti&rsquo;s compositions gave a multi-sided view on his
work. For many participants the performance of his Violin Concerto gave the
analysis session (&ldquo;Ligeti&rsquo;s Violin Concerto: Rediscovery and
Reinterpretation as Basic Formbuilding Principles&rdquo; by Yulia Kreinin from
Israel) an extra dimension. Amy Bauer (USA) took a quote from Ligeti:
&ldquo;Music has to be well constructed, but also to be poetical,&rdquo; as A
point of departure for her lecture &ldquo;Canon as secret rule and chaotic system
in the music of Ligeti&rdquo;, in which she made use of the system of the
mathematician Aristid Lindemayer. Finally Stephen Taylor showed Ligeti&rsquo;s
application of passacaglia technique in the Horn Trio and Violin Concerto in his
lecture &ldquo;Passacaglia and lament in Ligeti&rsquo;s recent music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[7] A session entitled &ldquo;The <i>Trois Poemes de Mallarme</i> of Debussy
and Ravel&rdquo; gave an interesting perspective of Mallarme&rsquo;s poetry and its
place in the history of literature. Contributions on this topic by Clemens Kemme
(The Netherlands): &ldquo;Futile Sighs of a Moondrunk? Ravel&rsquo;s and Debussy&rsquo;s
Mallarme-settings,&rdquo; Peter Kaminsky (USA): &ldquo;Text-music Transformation
in Ravel&rsquo;s <i>Trois Poemes de Stephane Mallarme</i>,&rdquo; Carles Guinovart
(Spain): &ldquo;The <i>Trois Poemes de Mallarme</i> of Debussy and Ravel,&rdquo;
Stephen Downes (UK): &ldquo;Nommez-nous<nobr>. . .</nobr> : Chords, names and desire in Debussy&rsquo;s
setting of Mallarme&rsquo;s <i>Placet Futile</i>,&rdquo; and Craig Ayrey (UK):
&ldquo;Syntax, Figures and Dissemination in Debussy&rsquo;s <i>Soupir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[8] The second conference of the Society for Music Theory will take place in
Antwerp at the Royal Flemish Conservatory on February 25 and 26, 2000. The main
subject of this conference will be the education-practice of music theory. Three
working groups, established during the inaugural conference, will report on
their findings: the working-group Research and the working-groups Classical
methodic and Jazz methodic. At this moment two international guest-speakers have
confirmed their presentation: Prof. Dr. Clemens Kuehn will give a lecture in
which the exchange between theory and practice is being discussed (&ldquo;Vermittlung?
Inhalte!&rdquo;), another lecture will be given be Dr. Paul Berliner, who
published a thorough investigation on improvisation in jazz (<i>Thinking in
Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation</i> [Chicago, University of Chicago
Press, 1994]).</p>
