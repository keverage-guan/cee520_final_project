<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The appearance of a facsimile edition of Stravinsky&rsquo;s
sketches for <i>Histoire du soldat</i> is cause for rejoicing. Editor Maureen
Carr is to be congratulated for obtaining permission to publish sketches held in
two Swiss collections (the Igor Stravinsky Collection at the Paul Sacher
Stiftung in Basel, and the Rychenberg Stiftung at the Stadtbibliothek Winterthur);
Chester Music of London also granted permission for the undertaking. In all,
more than 250 sketch leaves appear in this large-format (approximately 9 by 12
inches) publication from A-R Editions. The editor has provided an introductory
essay (pp. 3&ndash;19) and a pair of tables in which the sketches are identified
insofar as possible, locating the corresponding passages in the 1987 reprint of
the full score. There are also three short essays by Ramuz scholars Philippe
Girard, Alain Rochat, and No&euml;l Cordonier about the evolution of the text; each
is provided in French and in English translation. The quality of the
photographic reproductions is quite good, and scholars should be pleased that
the price of the volume is not exorbitant.<p>[2] Carr&rsquo;s introductory essay
explains that, like many of the works of Stravinsky&rsquo;s early period, <i>Histoire
du soldat</i> has a complex history. She provides a brief account of the
circumstances surrounding the collaboration between Stravinsky and
Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz during the years of the composer&rsquo;s Swiss exile, a
concise summary of the plot, excerpts from various reviews of performances, and
tables listing dates inscribed in the score used at the first performance and
publication information about later editions. A discussion of &ldquo;Criteria for
Establishing the Ordering of the Sketches&rdquo; (pp. 10&ndash;11) and &ldquo;The Musical Origins
of <i>Histoire du soldat</i>&rdquo; (pp. 11&ndash;12) provides a start toward the
challenging task of untangling the web of source materials. Carr also discusses
examples of rebarring in a series of sketches for the &ldquo;March du soldat&rdquo; (pp.
13&ndash;16) and explores questions of motivic linkage among the &ldquo;march&rdquo; movements (p.
17), thus providing some snapshots of the kinds of discoveries that await the
careful reader of Stravinsky&rsquo;s sketches. </p>
<p>[3] Questions of the compositional chronology of <i>Histoire</i> remain vexing. As
was previously noted by Robert Craft, important thematic ideas for the work
originated in sketches made for a setting of &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; a
collaboration with Andr&eacute; Gide that Stravinsky abandoned after several months of
work in 1917.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Stravinsky apparently first introduced the subject of <i>Histoire</i>
to Ramuz during the winter of that year. According to Richard Taruskin, the
first clear reference to their collaboration comes in a letter from Stravinsky
dated 28 February 1918.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Ramuz wrote a three-page synopsis of the story with
the provisional title &ldquo;Le soldat et le diable&rdquo; on the very same day.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> By 6 April, Stravinsky had completed a version of the Music to Scene One (&ldquo;Petits
airs au bord du ruisseau&rdquo;). Composition progressed rapidly, and the work was
premiered on 28 September 1918 in Lausanne.</p>

<p>[4] However, the first performance was (for a time) the last. Because of an
outbreak of Spanish influenza, to which the composer and various members of the
cast succumbed, only a single performance took place. Ramuz, an inveterate
reviser, continued to make modifications to the text, and Stravinsky also took
advantage of the opportunity to improve upon his score before the work was next
performed (as a concert suite) on 20 July 1920 in London. During the same year,
an abbreviated arrangement of the work (for clarinet, violin, and piano) was
published, and another (for piano solo) followed in 1922. According to Craft,
still more changes were made before the full score of the work was published in
1924 by J. W. Chester of London.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>
<p>[5] Even this cursory account of the genesis of <i>Histoire</i> is not without its
problems. Unfortunately, most sources contain contradictions, errors, and
omissions. For example, Craft&rsquo;s account of the revisions has appeared in two
slightly varied versions.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  In the latter, he states that
&ldquo;Stravinsky began
revising the score soon after this unique performance [the premiere on 28
September 1918], until only the Scene by the Brook and the Tango remained
unchanged.&rdquo; He further informs us that both the Lausanne premiere and the 1920
London performance of the concert suite were conducted by Ansermet from a full
score copied by Stravinsky&rsquo;s wife Catherine, into which numerous corrections
were later added.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Presumably, this is the
&ldquo;conductor&rsquo;s score&rdquo; mentioned by
Carr, currently located at the Stadtbibliothek Winterthur, from which she
provides her table of the dates &ldquo;as written by Stravinsky&rdquo;(p. 4). A comparison
of the table to the corresponding facsimile pages confirms that these dates
correspond exactly to the ones on the sketch leaves&mdash;down to the occasional
inclusion of both Old Style and New Style dating (the Gregorian and Julian
calendars were 13 days out of phase at this time, and Stravinsky sometimes used
both). Many of the dates are accompanied by the composer&rsquo;s signature, some with
the designation &ldquo;Morges,&rdquo; the location of the family dwelling at the time the
sketches were completed. This leaves us wondering whether Catherine&rsquo;s copy of
the score was annotated with dates from the sketches by the composer, or whether
Craft is incorrect about the hand in which this score is written. Craft also
refers to another score, requested by Stravinsky for a performance in Paris (7
November 1923), which had been &ldquo;used by Scherchen and myself. . . [and] has many
more corrections than the one you sent me.&rdquo; Craft says that score was in use in
Leipzig at that time.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Carr writes
&ldquo;The copyist&rsquo;s manuscript of 1920, with
annotations by Stravinsky and others, is missing. This manuscript was used as a
source for the Chester editions of 1987 and 1924&rdquo; (p. 19, note 68). It is
unclear, in short, exactly how many manuscript copies of the score exist, and
who wrote them.</p>

<p>[6] This is but one of the many areas in which Stravinsky scholars will require
additional documentary evidence in order to use the composer's sketches to their
fullest. In this regard, Carr&rsquo;s book represents both a great step forward and a
frustrating failure. On the one hand, it provides access to a large body of
primary source material that has never before been readily available. Although
Carr admits the possibility that some sketches may have become separated from
the ones reproduced here (p. 9), she claims the edition contains &ldquo;all the
existing sketches for <i>Histoire du soldat</i>&rdquo; (p. 17). On the other hand, issues of
chronology and interpretation are only minimally addressed. There is no thorough
account of the physical properties of the sketches. The dimensions of each
sketch leaf are given, but there is no description of paper types, the physical
makeup of the two bound sketchbooks, and exact locations of the various pages
within Stravinsky&rsquo;s other bound sketchbooks are sometimes vague. Regrettably,
there is no concordance with the catalogs of either the Paul Sacher Stiftung or
the Rychenberg Stiftung. Those who wish to consult the original documents will
need to use those finding aids on site.</p>

<p>[7] Let us make a brief tour of the sketches in order to clarify what this
facsimile edition might enable us to learn. The sketches are divided into eight
groups of varying sizes, and as Carr explains (pp. 10&ndash;11), it is very difficult
to establish a strictly chronological ordering among them. However, some general
conclusions could have been drawn. Some of the sketches in Group One are surely
among the earliest, because they include instrumentation indications that
reflect a different ensemble than that used in <i>Histoire</i>. These are assumed (by
Craft and Carr) to belong to Stravinsky&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rdquo; and
would thus date from 1917. Others, however, clearly relate to much later
efforts. For example, Figure 1.30 is a short score version of the Little
Chorale&mdash;the very last movement to be completed (the date in the &ldquo;conductor&rsquo;s
score&rdquo; is 23 September 1918, a mere five days before the premiere). Throughout
this group we find early versions of a number of the work&rsquo;s most prominent and
memorable themes: the chromatic melody from Rehearsal 10 of the Soldier&rsquo;s March
makes several appearances (in Figure 1.1, it is scored for three trumpets;
Figures 1.5 and 1.10 include less fully developed versions), and the
quintessential rhythmic motive from the Music to Scene One (five bars after
Rehearsal 4) appears in Figure 1.13, and so on. There are significant bits of
the Tango, the Ragtime, and the Waltz, as well as recognizable bits of the
Triumphal March of the Devil, the Devil&rsquo;s Dance, and the Royal March. It is
possible that some of these sketches may relate to revisions made after the
first performance. For example, Figures 1.35 through 1.41 relate to the
Triumphant March of the Devil, the instrumentation of which Stravinsky was still
revising for performances in 1923.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> What is crucial to know about this group
is that all of these sketch leaves (excepting the last four) are on the same
type of paper, all of uniform (or very nearly uniform) size, with six holes
punched in the margin. They were probably kept in a binder, or in several
binders. It is highly unlikely that the order in which they are presented here
is the order in which they were written. Placing them in chronological order may
require some very careful reconstruction.</p>
<p>[8] The Group Two sketches are equally fascinating&mdash;and equally mysterious. Most
of these sketches were written on the backs and in the margins of heavy sheets
of varying sizes cut from an old Italian ledger or account book. Again, there
are bits from various movements, and several leaves are dated: the transition
from the Tango to the Waltz (Figure 2.21, double-dated 16-3 July 1918), the
ending of the Little Concert (Figure 2.30, dated 10 August 1918), and the end of
the Triumphant March of the Devil (Figure 2.39, dated 26 August 1918).
Miscellaneous sketches for the narration during the reprise of the Soldier&rsquo;s
March, the Devil&rsquo;s Song, and a six-page draft of the Devil&rsquo;s Dance are not
dated. The ordering of these loose leaves is again impossible to determine
absolutely without more careful study.</p>
<p>[9] Group Three consists of sketches from a small vellum-bound sketchbook, on the
cover of which Stravinsky wrote &ldquo;Soldat croquis 1918.&rdquo; The leaves are of a
uniform paper type, and of nearly uniform size. In several cases, Stravinsky&rsquo;s
writing continues across an opening&mdash;suggesting that the writing took place after
the leaves were bound. But the sketchbook may have been rebound at some point:
Figure 3.35 (the last leaf on which musical sketches appear) is written upside
down, while Figure 3.36 (the verso of the same leaf) is right side up. The
latter leaf is dated 1 May 1918, and bears the fascinating inscription in
Italian &ldquo;parent of my first aria&rdquo; above an early version of the &ldquo;Princess
Motive.&rdquo; Stravinsky himself noted a resemblance between this theme and the
<i>Dies irae,</i> although he said the chant was not on his mind when he initially invented
the theme&mdash;and the sketches corroborate his claim: the earlier sketch version of
the theme is indeed less closely related to the chant melody than the
revision.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Here again, a detailed description of the stitching, the
gatherings, and the condition of the covers would be welcome. Occasionally, it
is impossible to read some of the fainter pencil entries on some of the
facsimile pages. Figure 3.7 is an example: Carr finds what she believes to be
possible early sketches for the Great Chorale here, but I cannot make out enough
notes to confirm her hypothesis. The notation I can read looks like that used in
the Tango (as in Figure 3.35). Among the most interesting entries are several
leaves devoted to work on the Great Chorale (Figures 3.28 through 3.33). Here
one can study some primitive versions of the melody and bass lines, multiple
attempts to fashion the movement&rsquo;s cadences, and some fascinating changes in the
details of scoring and meter.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> However, as we shall see, Craft is incorrect in claiming that the entire chorale
is to be found here.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>

<p>[10] Group Four includes sketches from another bound sketchbook, the so-called
&ldquo;Winterthur Sketchbook,&rdquo; now located at the Rychenberg Stiftung. Once again,
only the barest of physical description is supplied, leaving us to wonder about
many aspects of the book&rsquo;s condition. Carr has discovered that a series of pages
was at one point removed (they were presented to Stravinsky&rsquo;s patroness Eugenia Errazuriz on 6 February 1920). These leaves are now at the Paul Sacher Stiftung
in Basel. In Carr&rsquo;s edition, they appear in facsimile in their rightful place,
reunited with the Winterthur Sketchbook. The sketchbook begins with a sketches
and a draft of the Music to Scene One, the end of which is dated 6 April 1918.
This is the earliest ending date for any of the movements of the work, but
clearly these sketches are more highly developed than the primitive ones in
Group One. The next section of the (reconstructed) sketchbook consists of
sketches for the Ragtime and Waltz. The end of the Ragtime is dated 15 August
1918 (Figure 4a.14); the end of the Waltz bears no date. Another set of sketches
for the Great Chorale follows. Here, Stravinsky includes timings for the spoken
texts, as well as several important revisions to the central phrases, and (for
the first time), several drafts of the final phrases. A few details remain to be
changed before the published version is reached, but clearly these sketches
post-date those of the &ldquo;Croquis&rdquo; book. The next batch of sketches develops the
Royal March&mdash;which is initially titled &ldquo;Pasa-doble&rdquo; (Figure 4.28). Another
lengthy run of pages contains sketches and drafts for the Soldier&rsquo;s March, the
end of which is dated 25 June 1918. This would suggest that the March was
completed before the Ragtime, which precedes it in this sketchbook. Together
with the evidence that various groups of pages are separately paginated (in what
I believe to be Stravinsky&rsquo;s hand), this strongly implies that the Winterthur
Sketchbook was rebound after its original use, or that its components were first
gathered for binding only after they were written. Undated sketches and drafts
for the Tango follow, after which the sketchbook concludes with a few jottings
relating to the Music to Scene Two and a portrait sketch of Ren&eacute; Auberjonois
dated 1917 (Figure 4.85). This last is conclusive evidence that the ordering of
the contents of the book as it now exists has little to do with the chronology
of their creation.</p>

<p>[11] Group Five consists of five leaves of uniform size, which Carr informs us
were once bound together. The cover and second leaf bear no musical sketches.
The remaining leaves contain references to motives from the Music to Scene Two
interspersed with unidentified fragments. Some look to me a bit like the
cimbalom notation Stravinsky employed in <i>Renard</i> and the Ragtime for Eleven
Instruments, and indeed, the abbreviation &ldquo;Cimb&rdquo; appears twice in Figure 5.10.
These sketches do not look like they relate directly to the Ragtime for Eleven,
but one should remember that in fact, that work was completely sketched
(although not orchestrated) by 21 March 1918&mdash;that is, before work on <i>Histoire</i>
had progressed beyond its earliest phase.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p>[12] Group Six consists of miscellaneous early sketches from what is known as
Sketchbook III (there are ten numbered sketchbooks in the Igor Stravinsky
collection at the Sacher Stiftung). The four pages of sketches reproduced in
Carr&rsquo;s edition are all early ones for the Music to Scene Two; all are in
keyboard texture, and interestingly, the first is explicitly labeled &ldquo;piano&rdquo; in
Russian (Figure 6.1). These tentative sketches, and a listing of instruments in
Figure 1.6 (seven players, but with piano listed instead of bassoon!), suggest
that Stravinsky considered an alternative to the famous <i>Histoire</i>
ensemble.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup><br>
<br>
[13] Group Seven consists of two sketches from leaves filed with Sketchbook IV.
Carr is unable to identify the first (as am I); she suggests that the &ldquo;Valse&rdquo;
fragment in Figure 7.2 might or might not be associated with the Waltz in
<i>Histoire</i>. I tend to think it is not. <br>
<br>
[14] The final ten sketches (Group Eight) are somewhat easier to identify. Part
of the first is nearly identical to material in Figure 5.7, and both clearly
relate to the Music to Scene Two. However, the sketch immediately above this is
marked for clarinetto piccolo in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, and probably has nothing whatever to do
with <i>Histoire</i>. Other ideas here are tentative experiments that are difficult to
identify with any degree of certainty, although most of Carr&rsquo;s attempts seem
plausible. The entries she does not identify are of considerable interest: some
may reflect paths not taken, while others could be jottings related to other
works. Ideally, one would want to consider the content of pages before and after
the ones reproduced here, for it is the contextual relationships that are often
most valuable in assessing his entries in these sketchbooks, which tend to be
quite discontinuous. In general, Stravinsky seems to have used these books to
set down initial ideas; when he was ready to do more sustained sketching, he
often moved to a different format.</p>

<p>[15] As noted above, Carr provides two tables in which the contents of the sketch
leaves are identified. The first is organized by Group, and follows the order in
which the facsimile pages are laid out. The second is arranged to correlate with
the 1987 edition of the full score, so that one can readily locate all of the
sketches that correspond with any given movement in the work. Both tables
include translations of most (but not all) of Stravinsky&rsquo;s notations in various
languages. Unfortunately, a number of the instrumental designations are not
mentioned&mdash;and they can be important. For example, in Figure 8.1, the sketch Carr
believes may be one of the earliest versions of the opening of the Music to
Scene Two is marked &ldquo;cl. La&rdquo; (clarinet in A), whereas the published version is
for <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> clarinet; the Russian expressions at the bottom of this leaf are not
translated. Here and elsewhere, designations for instruments that do not belong
to the <i>Histoire</i> ensemble (piccolo, clarinet in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, horns, cimbalom) are
sometimes passed over. There are a number of trivial errors in the book: for
example, on p. 11, Erik Satie&rsquo;s name is misspelled, and on p. 47, the French
term for snare drum is misspelled. A more significant error is the wrong date at
the end of Musical Example 1 (p. 9), which should read 12 May (not 12 March).</p>

<p>[16] Still, let the rejoicing continue. Carr&rsquo;s edition provides an opportunity to
become acquainted with the complexities of Stravinsky&rsquo;s creative process, and to
spend many hours at the composer&rsquo;s elbow (as it were). With some patience, one
can compare and contrast numerous versions of the intricately interwoven themes
and motives of <i>Histoire</i>, and thus gain a greater appreciation for the work&rsquo;s
special integrity. Along with Carr&rsquo;s sketch tables, the essays of the literary
scholars provide a basic understanding of the fabulously complex process of
rewriting and revision both Ramuz and Stravinsky undertook as the work grew. Of
course, access to the original documents will still be necessary in order to
answer many of the harder questions, if only because no facsimile can convey the
full essence of an original document. Differences in paper type, shades of
coloration in the writing, erasures, and many other details jump out at one when
the original document is viewed, whereas these features may not be visible at
all in a facsimile. Even so, Stravinsky fans should celebrate the appearance of
this publication. We hope it will be only one among many more, and that its
appearance will foster close study and deeper appreciation for the composer&rsquo;s
works and his working methods.</p>
