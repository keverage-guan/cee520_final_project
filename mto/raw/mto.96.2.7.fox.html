<h3><center><a name="Section1">1. Summary and Background</a></h3></center>

<p>[1.1] In this second edition of their music education foundations
textbook, Abeles, Hoffer, and Klotman have prepared a thorough
overview of the school music education enterprise in the United
States.  The original edition of their book was published in 1984,
resulting from a need the authors experienced in their own graduate
music education classes for a comprehensive text on issues in the
profession.  This new (1994) version updates the earlier content by
identifying a number of significant events and themes that have
emerged in the decade between editions.  According to the authors,
there is approximately 40 percent new material and the book is
expanded by 10 percent:</p>

<blockquote>
The second edition of Foundations of Music Education expands the scope of the original 
volume to include such issues as the perception of an educational crisis in the last decade<nobr>. . .</nobr> ; 
the ever-growing impact of new technologies; the increasing urgency of calls for cultural 
pluralism; and the implications of new theoretical positions in the psychology of education. 
(Preface, pages xiii, xiv)
</blockquote>

<h3><center><a NAME="Section2">2. Organization and Content of the Book</a></h3></center>

<p>[2.1] The physical layout and structure of the second edition has
changed little from the first.  Following an introductory chapter that
gives a broad historical review of music teaching and learning, the
book is loosely organized into reports of a series of influences on
music education, including philosophical, sociological/psychological,
and pedagogical.</p>

<p>[2.2] A listing of the twelve chapter titles offers a glimpse of the
contents: (1) history of music education; (2) philosophical
foundations of music education; (3) the musical and aesthetic
foundations of music education; (4) the role and purpose of music in
American education; (5) sociological foundations of music education;
(6) social psychological foundations of music education; (7)
psychological foundations of music education; (8) applications of
psychology to music teaching; (9) curriculum; (10) assessing musical
behaviors; (11) research and music education; and (12) teacher
education and future directions.  Some minor changes in labeling have
taken place, e.g. &ldquo;Assessing Musical Behaviors&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;Measurement
and Evaluation of Musical Behaviors,&rdquo; reflecting a more current use of
terminology; and Chapter 4 was formerly titled the Purpose and
Function of Music in American **Musical** Education.</p>

<p>[2.3] Each chapter presents a kind of &ldquo;mini-course&rdquo; on a topic.  Each
concludes with a summary of the salient topics, and with study and
discussion questions, individual or class activities, supplementary
readings, and references.  The following examples are taken from the
first chapter:</p>

<p>[2.4] In Chapter 1, the summary is presented in the form of a
multiple-page chronological table of the history of music education,
offering a quick review and a visual reference for the sequence of
music education events in American society.  The study questions focus
the reader&rsquo;s attention on the factual content of the chapter. Examples
of study questions:</p>

<blockquote>
Why were Lowell Mason&rsquo;s efforts at establishing 
music in the schools limited to vocal music at 
the elementary level?  On what basis did he 
justify the inclusion of music in the school 
curriculum?
<br><br>
What were the significant points made at the 
Tanglewood Symposium?
</blockquote>

<p>[2.5] The suggested activities involve more reflection and synthesis of
information, and require expanded contextual understanding of the
content of the chapter.  They could easily be incorporated into a
course syllabus as assignments or individual projects for paper
writing and presentation. An example of a suggested activity:</p>

<blockquote>
Select a significant period in music education 
and explore in detail what was occurring in world 
events at that time.  Who was being educated and 
what was occurring socially during that period?  
How did these events and attitudes affect music 
education?
</blockquote>


<h3><center><a NAME="Section3">3. Philosophical Foundations: Chapters 2, 3, and 4</a></h3></center>

<p>[3.1] Although they have separate titles and themes, these three
chapters essentially comprise the philosophical foundations component
of the book.  Chapter 2 sets out the philosophical positions and
answers the question, &ldquo;What does philosophy have to do with music
teaching?&rdquo;  The authors&rsquo; answer is three-fold: (1) music teachers must
make decisions and take actions; (2) a comprehensive, systematic
understanding of what one is trying to do serves as a guide for
action; and (3) teachers need to be consistent in what they do.  To
support this foundation for decision-making, AB&amp;K outline three basic
philosophical viewpoints: rationalism, empiricism, and pragmatism.
[It is interesting to note that in the first edition of the book,
there were four philosophical views that formed the framework for this
discussion: naturalism, idealism, realism, and pragmatism.  In this
second edition, rationalism replaces idealism, empiricism replaces
realism, with naturalism subsumed as a variant of empiricism.]  The
chapter 2 summary includes a table comparing strengths and weaknesses
of the four [sic] philosophies.</p>

<p>[3.2] Chapter 3 is centered around the issue of arguing for the
inclusion of music and the arts as subjects for study in the school;
identifying characteristics of the aesthetic experience; and the
always controversial topic of &ldquo;quality in musical works,&rdquo; formerly
titled &ldquo;quality of musical works.&rdquo;  Leonard Meyer is featured
prominently in this section, summarizing his views into four essential
points, mainly dealing with expectations.  Included also is a brief
discussion of the non-musical value of musical study, a topic of
continuing interest in the popular press in the 1990s.</p>

<p>[3.3] The final chapter on philosophy takes the &ldquo;why&rdquo; question into the
&ldquo;how&rdquo; of environments for learning, namely public schools.  The
questions include why we need schools, and then why music learning
should take place inside them as part of the total development of
children.  According to the authors, this all leads to the Music
Educators National Conference because we need a professional
organization to keep us on track:</p>

<blockquote>
Once music became formalized in a social 
institution such as the school, it then became 
necessary to provide a forum where music 
educators could interact and exchange ideas that 
would ultimately provide direction and standards 
for the profession. (page 103)
</blockquote>

<p>This statement seems to provide a rationale for the reference to or
inclusion of, throughout the remainder of the book, nearly everything
published by the MENC during the 20th century.</p>


<h3><center><a NAME="Section4">4. Sociology and Psychology: Chapters 5, 6, and 7</a></h3></center>

<p>[4.1] These chapters are connected through their emphasis on the
&ldquo;people&rdquo; dimension of music education; the sociology, social
psychology and psychology themes are explored in detail.</p>

<p>[4.2] Chapter 5 emphasizes the tremendous importance of the social
environment in which a child grows up as the influence on musical
development.  The traditional nature/nurture question opens the
discussion, followed by sections on socialization, and music as human
behavior.  Extended descriptions of factors affecting musical behavior
are reviewed, including functions of music, social stratification, age
stratification, ethnocentrism, pluralism, cultural standards, mass
taste, and the effect of technology on music and music teaching.</p>

<p>[4.3] The authors differentiate the content of Chapters 5 and 6 this
way: While sociologists might study the roles of music in society
(Chapter 5), social psychologists might investigate how individuals
acquire musical preference (page 149).  The topics of self-image,
conformity, roles and expectations, competition/cooperation,
leadership, and attitudes are covered in Chapter 6, along with
creativity in its various forms in music education.</p>

<p>[4.4] Psychological foundations in Chapter 7 begins with a review of
what the authors call dominant psychological schools of learning
theories and theorists.  These include behaviorists, such as
B. F. Skinner and cognitivists such as Jerome Bruner, followed by
developmental psychologists Piaget and Gagne.  Sections on cognitive
processing, musical ability and motivation, and contextual factors
contribute to the potpourri approach of this chapter.  Several graphic
figures of learning models illustrate the content.  The study
questions are thoughtful and applied:</p>

<blockquote>
How might a behaviorist middle school general 
music teacher organize a lesson on the features 
of African music?  How might a cognitivist middle 
school general music teacher organize such a 
lesson? (page 227)
</blockquote>

<p>[4.5] This type of study question actually leads into the next section
of the textbook, chapters 8-10, where the focus shifts to teaching.
Chapter 8 applies the psychological principles to music teaching
situations, Chapter 9 recommends the organization of music content and
music instruction through a focus on curriculum, and Chapter 10
advises how to determine what has been learned as a result of this
instruction.</p>

<p>[4.6] Chapter 8 includes a wide range of somewhat unrelated topics on
psychological themes: (1) a review of the taxonomy of educational
objectives originally attributed to Benjamin Bloom (cognitive,
affective, and psychomotor domains of learning); (2) the development
of music objectives stated behaviorally; (3) the issue of
accountability (with just a hint of the standards and assessments
coming in the mid-1990s); (4) individualized instruction; (5)
programmed and computer-based instruction; (6) music instruction with
computers; (7) a behavioral approach to music instruction; and (8)
Gordon&rsquo;s Learning Theory.</p>

<p>[4.7] The chapter on curriculum begins by defining curriculum,
differentiating between curriculum and course of study, and continues
by listing many types of curriculum projects that have been sponsored
or endorsed by the MENC over the past several decades.  There is a
heavy emphasis on past MENC documents for descriptions of programs of
study.  Other newer topics of curricular interest are introduced,
e.g., discipline-based learning, early childhood education,
multicultural music education, and music education for the
handicapped.</p>

<p>[4.8] Renamed from the first edition, the assessment chapter
incorporates new thinking on the issues of assessment that developed
during the past decade.  The authors address the importance of this
topic while acknowledging that music teachers in general have been
poorly prepared to implement assessment techniques in their music
programs.  Following a brief theoretical grounding in assessment
vocabulary and concepts, the chapter describes of the National
Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) and the corollary music
assessments; program evaluation and teacher evaluation are auxiliary
sections.</p>


<h3><center><a NAME="Section5">5. Future Directions</a></h3></center>

<p>[5.1] The final two chapters of the text involve research and teacher
education, two topics that should not only examine the present but
consider the future of the profession.  The research chapter is an
excellent introduction to the music education research initiative.
This second edition provides a brief new section on ethnographic
research, an expanding area of inquiry in music-related research.  The
suggestions for analyzing research, connected to an actual research
study for critique, give the reader strategies for personal research
review and writing.</p>

<p>[5.2] The chapter on teacher education includes several new topics.  In
the past decade, there were varied efforts to address issues of the
qualifications of teaching personnel, among them reports from the
Holmes group (higher education professionals) and from the Carnegie
Commission.  All of them recommended changes in the preparation of
teachers in general, promoting increased time in the focused
internship experience following the undergraduate preparation in the
disciplines themselves.  Along with these generic education reports,
the chapter reviews the newer MENC publication on teacher education,
Partnership and Process, which proposed strategies for the recruitment
and retention of music education students in addition to promoting the
connections between public schools and colleges in fieldwork
experiences for students.</p>


<h3><center><a NAME="Section6">6. Conclusion and Critique</a></h3></center>

<p>[6.1] As a foundations text for graduate courses in music education,
the Abeles, Hoffer, and Klotman text offers an initial level of
understanding of how we arrived at this (1994) point in time in the
American culture of schools, and identifies important themes for study
and discussion. The content is comprehensive and well-written, with
clearly organized chapters and activities that lend themselves easily
to various forms of segmented study.  This second edition will
continue to serve the music profession well as a standard reference on
the history and status of school music education programs in the
United States.</p>

<p>[6.2] As a reference for music education broadly defined, however, the
book just barely scratches the surface of this foundation.  It could
more accurately be titled &ldquo;Foundations of Public School Music
Education in the 19th and 20th Centuries,&rdquo; because its focus is so
specific to that population of school-age learners, and because the
text basically documents what has been done rather than what could be
accomplished if we build on this foundation.</p>


<h3><center><a name="Section7">7. Specific Concerns About the Book</a></h3></center>

<p>[7.1] In chapter 1, the opening five pages are devoted to the
historical base for music study, in Plato and Aristotle, in the schola
cantorum and the medieval university, and in the conservatories and
music schools from the 1500s to the 19th century.  By page five,
however, the content of the book is firmly planted in America, and
from that point on the emphasis is not only singularly American, it is
singularly public school in its discussion.</p>

<p>[7.2] Even within the public school theme, however, significant issues
are not included. There is no discussion of current issues in
education that are affecting the delivery of music instruction, such
as the organizational structures of schools, middle schools,
school-based planning teams, cooperative learning<nobr>. . .</nobr> Issues of
urban education and the decline of music programs in urban school
districts<nobr>. . .</nobr> Magnet schools and fine/performing arts high
schools<nobr>. . .</nobr> How do these different learning environments
influence the music programs?  What about the advocacy efforts that
draw together schools and communities on behalf of the arts?</p>

<p>[7.3] Especially in the sociological chapter, there also needs to be an
awareness of the music education structures outside the frame of
public school, the influence of community music schools, the influence
of church music programs, the influence of other professional
organizations beyond the MENC, such as the American String Teachers
Association and the Music Teachers National Association.  Reading this
book, it appears that no music education takes place unless it&rsquo;s in
public schools.</p>

<p>[7.4] In the section on curriculum, there should be discussion or
description of influences on American music curriculum such as Kodaly,
Orff-Schulwerk, Dalcroze, and Suzuki.  In the section on handicapped
learners, there is no mention of the most recent federal law, the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which has prompted
the placement of increasing numbers of multiply-disabled children into
music programs in school settings (called inclusion), as well as
increasing the demand for private and community-based music
instruction adapted for these learners.</p>

<p>[7.5] The authors of this text have in the past established themselves
as organizational leaders for the music education profession.  Both
Hoffer and Klotman have been MENC presidents, and Abeles consistently
contributes to MENC efforts.  I would encourage all of them to broaden
their horizons, and to establish the third edition of their textbook
as the symbolic and structural foundation for music education--not
just for today, but for the 21st century of American musical
education.</p>
