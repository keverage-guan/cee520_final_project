<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The simplicity of this book&rsquo;s title is at once bold and presumptuous. It
is arguably the most thorough and ambitious project to date in its attempt to
assemble and explain the myriad of devices that jazz musicians rely upon to
adapt the principles of traditional harmony to their improvisational needs.
Literally hundreds of well-chosen examples are presented in a systematic and
orderly fashion, transcribed from a wide array of recordings, with convincing
explanations regarding the harmonic choices made by the performers. Were this
volume to have nothing else to offer, which I do not mean to suggest, the
transcribed musical excerpts themselves would present an invaluable reference
tool for anyone with an interest in jazz theory.</p>
<p>[2] Ironically, one of the most frustrating aspects of the book for me was
the author&rsquo;s stated aim in writing it, viz., to provide a practical set of rules
and guidelines for improvisers that can be abandoned when mastery has been
attained. &ldquo;Theory,&rdquo; Levine writes, &ldquo;is the little intellectual
dance we do around the music, attempting to come up with rules so we can
understand why Charlie Parker and John Coltrane sounded the way they did&rdquo;
(page vii). Or, stated more poetically, &ldquo;Be aware of what your eyes see and
what your hands feel when you play. Do this just as much as you focus your mind
on the mental stuff, and you&rsquo;ll get beyond theory&mdash;where you just flow with the
music. Aim for that state of grace, when you no longer have to think about
theory.&rdquo; (page vii). Clearly, theorists are not Levine&rsquo;s intended
audience.</p>
<p>[3] Presumably, Levine has written this book as a reference tool for the jazz
musician. The format does not directly adapt to classroom use, since no
exercises are included and material is not presented in order of progressive
difficulty. For example, while the first chapter includes a digestible summary
of basic intervals and chords, and chapter 2 introduces some common chord
progressions, chapter 3, &ldquo;Chord/Scale Theory,&rdquo; soon plunges into murky
waters. Levine quickly becomes bogged down in discussions of several esoteric
chords that are bound to raise objections from experienced jazz musicians and
simply lead to confusion among less experienced. The nadir of this chapter for
me was a four-page discussion of the susb9 chord, derived from the Phrygian
mode. While Levine admits that the chord is a &ldquo;relatively new sound in jazz
harmony&rdquo; (page 49), such an extended discussion of this chord so early in the
book is misleading and perplexing. To put this in perspective, Chapter 10,
&ldquo;The Blues,&rdquo; does not occur until page 219, and basic song form is
reserved for chapter 17, beginning on page 383. Attempting to use this book as a
text for any level of study would require careful selection and shuffling of
material.</p>
<p>[4] Levine has taken great pains to keep all discussions and examples solidly
within the jazz realm. Generally, he steers clear of popular and Broadway
influences, despite their strong historical ties with the music. Thus, in
chapter 1, when choosing representative melodies to correspond with common
intervals, Levine selects Thelonious Monk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blue Monk&rdquo; to represent
the ascending half-step, and Cedar Walton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bolivia&rdquo; to represent the
descending half-step. Surely there are a host of standard tunes (Rogers and
Hart&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Romance&rdquo; and Victor Young&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stella by Starlight&rdquo;
come to mind) that are more memorable and better known both in and out of the
jazz world. But Levine takes the title of his book seriously, and however much
the materials of jazz may resemble or derive from popular, theater, or classical
music, those connections do not concern him.<a href="#FN1" name="FN1REF"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>[5] Levine does not waver from his attempt to present a well-documented
compendium of procedures and devices that constitute the essence of jazz theory.
Unfortunately, what is egregiously lacking is theoretical discussion. There can
be no doubt that Levine&rsquo;s primary interest is how to apply the concepts
described in improvisational contexts. For this reason, alternative
interpretations or explanations of musical phenomena do not interest him.</p>
<p>[6] The most glaring example of this bias concerns a fundamental concept that
permeates Levine&rsquo;s entire book&mdash;that of chord and scale equivalency. This view,
in essence, assumes that any chord symbol used in jazz implies a full complement
of upper extensions (7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), and accordingly can be
reinterpreted as some type of (usually) seven-note scale. For example, the chord
symbol Dm7, according to this approach, would imply a possible 9th, 11th, and
13th, and would therefore be seen as equivalent to the Dorian mode. It is an
indisputable fact that many jazz musicians share this view, and the expediency
and usefulness of this approach is not to be denied.<a href="#FN2" name="FN2REF"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
But in establishing chord and scale relationships Levine seems to lose sight of
the fact that triadic progression is still the underlying harmonic force driving
most of the musical examples presented in this book. A statement of such direct
simplicity as &ldquo;the scale and the chord are two forms of the same
thing&rdquo; (page 33) is an exaggeration and grossly misleading. A Cmaj7(9,<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>11,13)
serving as a tonic chord in the key of C and the same chord serving as the
subdominant in the key of G share the same notes, and may both be thought of as
verticalizations of the Lydian mode, but they serve two entirely different
functions in the diatonic context, and are likely to be treated as such by the
improviser. Among other things, one contains the fourth degree of the key, and
the other does not. Perhaps Levine has stated the true relationship of scale to
mode more accurately when he writes, &ldquo;The reason jazz musicians think of
scales, or modes, when they improvise, is because it&rsquo;s easier than thinking in
terms of chords&rdquo; (page 32). But it may be necessary to think in terms of
chords when diatonic function is a significant component of the harmonic
motion.</p>
<p>[7] In attempting to build a theory of chord/scale relationships from a modal
point of view instead of traditional diatonic function, Levine gets into
difficulties immediately. He begins with a &ldquo;Major Scale Harmony&rdquo;
chart, but does not list chords according to diatonic function. Instead, Levine
presents a list of the seven modes associated with the diatonic scale and
attempts to assign an appropriate chord to each.<a href="#FN3" name="FN3REF"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
Placing himself in the untenable position of having to pull all seven notes of
each mode into a verticalization, Levin is in trouble on the first chord, since
the C chord (the unacknowledged tonic) has an F in it. Levine observes:
&ldquo;There is a note in the scale that is much more dissonant than the other
six notes<nobr>. . .</nobr> This is a so-called &lsquo;avoid&rsquo; note<nobr>. . .</nobr> &lsquo;Avoid note&rsquo; is not a very good
term, because it implies that you shouldn&rsquo;t play the note at all. A better name
would be a &lsquo;handle with care&rsquo; note&rdquo; (page 37). Levine goes on to explain that
improvisers generally treat the note as a passing tone, but nowhere does he
mention the note&rsquo;s tendency to resolve to the third. Nor is there any suggestion
that the seven notes of the mode (the &ldquo;available pool of notes&rdquo; [page
32]) should be considered in any hierarchical order. Indeed, the very term
&ldquo;avoid note&rdquo; suggests an embellishing tone, but there is no mention of
what is being embellished. Presumably, the members of the tonic triad have no
particular importance beyond that of the other notes in the Ionian mode.<a href="#FN4" name="FN4REF"><sup>(4)</sup></a></p>

<p>[8] The Dorian mode, associated with ii<sup>7</sup>, provides perhaps the most
satisfactory chord/scale equivalency among the diatonic chords. Since the chord
functions as a predominant, the inclusion of the fourth and seventh of the key,
along with the tonic note, does not pose any difficulties when the full
complement of notes in the Dorian mode are sounded. Likewise, an egalitarian
approach to the seven notes is not problematic, since the chord&rsquo;s predominant
function does not call for any strong implications of tension or
resolution.</p>
<p>[9] The Mixolydian mode again poses the obstacle of an &ldquo;avoid
note,&rdquo; the fourth. Here Levine does mention the note&rsquo;s tendency to resolve
downward to the third of the chord. What he does not mention is that the fourth
is the tonic, and that its absence (and resulting expectation) is fundamental to
the tendency toward resolution created by dominant function. Levine&rsquo;s only
concern regarding this note is its dissonance, as if dissonance were some
generic quality divorced from voice leading: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that the context
will decide whether or not you play C on a G7 chord. You might specifically want
to play something dissonant, or you might want to play the 11th and then resolve
it down a half step to the 3rd<nobr>. . .</nobr> Remember not to think of dissonance as
&lsquo;bad.&rsquo; Dissonance is not a pejorative term; it&rsquo;s a musical device you can use
when appropriate&rdquo; (page 41). This may be true, but it does not explain why
the note is found in a scale that is purportedly equivalent to the dominant
chord. A more reasonable view would hold that the Mixolydian mode does indeed
form a loose fit with the dominant chord, with the exception of the fourth note,
which is not at all congruent with the upper structures associated with that
chord.<a href="#FN5" name="FN5REF"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p>

<p>[10] A similar problem arises in a discussion of &ldquo;sus&rdquo; chords.
Initially an abbreviation for suspension, a sus chord is generally a dominant
chord in which one hears the fourth (tonic) in place of the expected third.
While the resemblance to the cadential <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> triad is apparent, sus chords are
seldom prepared or resolved as suspensions. On the contrary, the chord often
occurs in contexts of minimal harmonic motion, where the chord is liable to
remain for eight or more measures, and likely to move to another sus
chord.</p>

<p>[11] The problem that now arises&mdash;if the Mixolydian mode is considered
equivalent to the Vsus chord&mdash;is that the mode contains an unwanted third.
Levine circumvents this difficulty by arguing that the third is not an
undesirable note in sus chords: &ldquo;A persistent myth is that &lsquo;the 4th takes the place of the 3rd in a sus chord.&rsquo; This was true at one time, but in the
1960s, a growing acceptance of dissonance led pianists and guitarists to play
sus voicings with both the 3rd and the 4th&rdquo; (page 46). Undeniably, jazz
musicians have explored this possibility. The question is how to interpret the
resulting chord. If a sus chord is to retain anything of its presumed historical
origin, then the absence of the leading tone would seem to be requisite. If jazz
theory, in practice, has dispensed with the preparation and resolution of this
suspension, what must remain is at least the displacement of the third of the
chord. If the third is present, and we indeed have a dominant triad with upper
extensions, then it is not clear what justifies pulling the 11th of the chord
into the basic structure and calling it a sus chord. If one were to argue that
the voicings generally employed in contexts where both the third and fourth are
present seem to suggest the sus chord, then it will have to be attributed to
intended ambiguity, much as a twentieth-century composer might flirt with the
ambiguity between major and minor tonality. There is little to justify the
conclusion that sus chords implicitly contain the third, which is available
anytime one wishes to include it in the harmonic structure. Again, Levine is
avoiding the obvious: The Mixolydian mode is indeed roughly equivalent with a
Vsus chord, with the exception of the third, which is completely foreign to the
harmony.<a href="#FN6" name="FN6REF"><sup>(6)</sup></a></p>

<p>[12] The dissonant structures of jazz harmony are bound to invite comment and
discussion, and occasionally Levine is drawn into speculations that are poorly
reasoned and naive. Conjecturing on a possible voicing of a sus4 chord that
would include both a major third and perfect fourth (perhaps better labeled a
dominant chord with an eleventh), Levine observes that the result would be
extremely dissonant due to the resulting minor ninth between these notes,
failing to comment at all on the fact that the chord also contains both the
leading tone and the tonic: &ldquo;What makes this chord so dissonant is the
interval between B and C&mdash;a minor 9th&mdash;&lsquo;the last dissonant interval&rsquo;.&rdquo;
Levine then makes an unfortunate generalization about the nature of dissonance:
&ldquo;The entire history of Western music can be characterized as the gradual
acceptance of dissonant intervals<nobr>. . .</nobr> The minor 9th still sounds pretty
dissonant to most ears, but is slowly evolving into a &lsquo;consonant&rsquo; interval&rdquo;
(page 47). Even if it were possible to rank intervals according to consonance or
dissonance independent of music context (and I do not believe that it is), there
still exists a contradiction in Levine&rsquo;s assertion. The acceptance of dissonance
and the propensity to hear what was once considered dissonant as consonant are
two different things. If there has been a gradual acceptance of dissonant
intervals, then it is because there is an increasing desire for dissonance. If
dissonant intervals are slowly evolving into consonant ones, then there cannot
be a concomitant gradual acceptance of dissonance. It must be one or the other,
not both.</p>

<p>[13] As stated earlier, Levine&rsquo;s insistence on associating a chord with each
of the seven modes so that all of the chord&rsquo;s upper extensions coincide with the
notes in the mode results in some rare and unusual chords. Levine is probably
correct in asserting that the Phrygian mode is usually played over sus<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>9 chords,
but beyond that, it is not clear what is to be gained from exploring the
relationship. His dozen musical examples make a convincing case for the chord&rsquo;s
existence in the recorded literature, but Levine offers no explanation of the
chord&rsquo;s origins, function, or treatment. He does observe, however, that the
notes usually played on the sus<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>9 chord are the root, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>9, 4th, 5th, and 7th. If
this is the case, and the potential minor 3rd and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>13 suggested by the Phrygian
are not used as part of the vertical harmony, then where is the alleged
equivalence?</p>

<p>[14] Levine&rsquo;s discussion of the Aeolian mode hints at some admission of the
futility in attempting a mode-oriented approach to jazz harmony: &ldquo;Aeolian
chords are rarely specifically called for, and there is some confusion over
exactly what constitutes an Aeolian chord and when to play an Aeolian
scale&rdquo; (page 52). He offers a minor b6 chord as the appropriate place for
this mode. Not only is this chord rare, it may be nonexistent. The reason is
that it is unnecessary, since the notes are better viewed (and explained
functionally) as a first-inversion major seventh chord built on the root a major
third lower.</p>

<p>[15] Levine offers two examples of this chord, both unconvincing. The first
is from Kenny Barron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunshower,&rdquo; where an A minor chord in the
first measure sees the addition of both an F and a D in the second. This is
labeled A-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>6, with no reference to the D. Levine then admits, &ldquo;Kenny&rsquo;s tune
also sounds like a I-IV progression in a minor key, so it could alternately be
notated <nobr>A-, D-/A&rdquo;</nobr> (page 53). This, indeed, seems the only logical way to view
the progression. Levine&rsquo;s second example, from Fats Waller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t
Misbehavin&rsquo;,&rdquo; shows the first three measures of the bridge (in the key of C
minor) as one measure apiece of C-, C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>6, and C-6. The chord commonly played in
the second measure is <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, resulting in a i, VI<sup>6</sup>, i progression in C minor. There
hardly seems justifiable reason to introduce an extremely rare vertical
structure into the progression when a simple inversion of a diatonic chord will
neatly provide the necessary notes.</p>

<p>[16] With the Locrian mode, Levine again finds himself at a loss in providing
an appropriate chord. He selects the half-diminished seventh (generally referred
to as the minor seventh [<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5] by jazz musicians), with the caveat that the
resulting <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>9 is an avoid note. But unlike other modes with avoid notes, this
avoid note is the wrong note. Jazz musicians frequently play the 9th on a
half-diminished chord, but it is the natural 9th. The scale should contain a
major second between the first two notes if it is to provide the notes
associated with the half-diminished chord. Levine discusses such a scale (a
melodic minor starting on the sixth degree) later on in the book, indicating
that over time it has become the scale of choice for a half-diminished chord.
But his assertion that &ldquo;almost all of the early bebop musicians played the
Locrian mode on half-diminished chords&rdquo; (page 69) is misleading. There was no
chord/scale theory in the 1940s. The notes chosen by early bebop musicians on
this chord may indeed have looked like a Locrian mode (probably because habitual
fingering patterns tended to follow the major scale), but surely no one thought
of the Locrian scale as equivalent to the half-diminished chord. Voice leading
would have rendered the flatted second degree a mere nonharmonic tone.</p>

<p>[17] There is nothing wrong with a scale/chord equivalency theory if it is
viewed as an expedient to jazz improvisation. Levine&rsquo;s discussions are useful,
practical, and substantiated by copious musical examples. My objection concerns
the attempt to use scales or modes as precise substitutes for chords, which
often results in altering the chord to fit the mode. Moreover, the implication
is that the modes or scales that can be derived from the basic
&ldquo;parent&rdquo; scales&mdash;major, melodic minor, diminished (octatonic), and
whole tone&mdash;somehow form the basis of a system of harmony. There is very little
discussion of functional harmony in this book. Instead, there is an implication
that a stable, underlying array of scales lies behind all chordal harmony, as if
the scales themselves preceded the chords. When Levine states, for example,
&ldquo;The C7alt chord is derived from the seventh mode of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> melodic minor
scale,&rdquo; (page 70), the suggestion is that the scale was in existence before
the chord. In fact, jazz musicians were playing C7alt chords (with various
names) long before anyone attempted to assemble all of the chord tones in linear
form. Nor would analysis of early improvisations on C7alt chords reveal any
prototype or early instances of the chord&rsquo;s equivalence to the seventh mode of
the melodic minor scale, since early (and later, for that matter) improvisers
chose freely from the twelve notes in the chromatic scale and succeeded in
achieving the desired chord sound through voice leading.</p>

<p>[18] A chord and scale can be considered equivalent only if all the notes in
the scale are played as a vertical structure. This is seldom the case. Piano
players rarely include all of the possible extensions in the harmony. The chord
symbol C7alt suggests the possible extensions of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>9, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>9, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>11, and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>13, but it
would be unusual to include all of these notes in the same voicing. The real
meaning of the symbol is that the piano player should choose from this selection
of notes. Likewise, an improviser would probably not wish to include all
possible extensions as chord members in a linear passage. Constructing a line
based on the altered scale in which all notes are on equal footing (that is,
structural to the passage), is a remote possibility, but not a common approach
to an altered chord. More likely, at least in straight-ahead or bebop
improvisation, notes will be emphasized in hierarchical fashion, with the third
and seventh and one or two upper extensions serving as structural tones. Even in
more dissonant styles involving improvisations that go &ldquo;outside&rdquo; the
chord, an egalitarian treatment to all possible upper structures is an unlikely
approach.</p>

<p>[19] There is no question that Levine&rsquo;s assertions, when taken as practical
advice for the performing musician, are solid and well-supported. What is
disturbing is his disregard for theoretical concerns, even when those concerns
are patent and demand comment or explanation. In a discussion of minor keys,
Levine asserts, &ldquo;the three chords in a [C] minor II-V-I are derived from
three different melodic minor scales<nobr>. . .</nobr> The notes played over the D
half-diminished chord are from the F melodic minor [starting on the sixth
degree], the notes played over the G7alt chord are from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> melodic minor
[starting on the seventh degree], and the notes played over the C-maj chord are
from C melodic minor&rdquo; (pages 75&ndash;76). Basically, this is sound advice to the
improviser, if a little complex, but more discussion is warranted. Lamenting the
difficulty in navigating these chords, Levine suggests &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
great if there were a scale that worked over D half-diminished, G7alt, C-maj, a
minor II-V-I? It would be but there isn&rsquo;t one. The harmonic minor scale is often
mentioned in theory books as being &lsquo;a scale played over a minor <nobr>II-V-I.&rsquo;</nobr> If that
were true, you&rsquo;d hear the great players playing it a lot, but they don&rsquo;t&rdquo;
(page 76). Later in the book, Levine takes up the argument again: &ldquo;One reason
the harmonic minor scale is seldom played in its entirety is that it fits no one
particular chord. No matter what chord you play it on, at least one note, if
held against the chord, sounds like an &lsquo;avoid&rsquo; note&rdquo; (page 477). This is
bound to occur in a theory that neglects voice leading. Levine has failed to see
the obvious&mdash;the harmonic minor scale is the scale of the key to which all three
chords belong. Because some of the notes in the scale are tendency tones, they
can only work within the context of dominant or predominant harmony. Similarly,
the notes that suggest resolution, particularly the tonic, are unlikely
structural tones for a passage improvised on the dominant chord. Levine&rsquo;s
observation that jazz musicians &ldquo;play fragments of [the harmonic minor
scale] but very rarely the entire scale [on the II-V-I progression]&rdquo; (page
476) is not at all surprising. Why should we expect improvisers to include the
tonic on the V chord or the leading tone on the i?</p>

<p>[20] Levine&rsquo;s understanding of jazz theory appears to be tantamount to a
method of jazz improvisation, and that method is formulaic and procedural. Rules
are distilled from the study of a vast number of jazz improvisations, chosen
from the most respected musicians in the field. But analyses are superficial and
do little to elucidate the harmonic activity found in the passages presented.
The recurring statement that a particular chord &ldquo;derives from&rdquo; a
particular scale suggests that improvisers are bound or restricted to that
connection. It is ironic that the more harmonically dissonant and innovative
jazz styles that are the emphasis of this book should be founded on more
restrictive principles than the styles that preceded them. Certainly, Charlie
Parker or Lester Young did not consider themselves limited to the scale built on
the sixth degree of F melodic minor when playing on a D half-diminished
chord.</p>

<p>[21] There is very little mention of function in this book and roman numeral
symbols are seldom included. This is unfortunate, since it is undeniable that
the prevailing key and a chord&rsquo;s function in that key strongly influence an
improviser&rsquo;s choices. In one of the few instances in which a song is provided
with a complete harmonic analysis, that analysis is so unorthodox that it
confuses rather than clarifies understanding. In a discussion of the ii-V-I
progression, Levine posits the chords to John Klenner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just Friends&rdquo;
with an analysis that labels each chord as either a ii<sup>7</sup>, a V<sup>7</sup> or a I. Levine
presents the chords in the original key of G major, but fails to include a key
signature, and proceeds as if the key were C major. The first four chords, two
measures of C, one measure apiece of C<sup>m7</sup> and F<sup>7</sup>, and two measures of G, are
analyzed as I in C major, ii<sup>7</sup> in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, V<sup>7</sup> in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, and I in G major. This
inexplicable analysis requires three keys to explain what is obviously a
commonplace chord sequence in the key of G major. The analysis that most readily
presents itself is a IV followed by iv<sup>7</sup> (borrowed from the parallel minor), the
insertion of the related V<sup>7</sup> of the C<sup>m7</sup> as a chord substitution (nonstructural),
leading to I. In all, Levine&rsquo;s analysis of the entire song shows modulations to
seven different keys. While there are several instances of secondary function
and tonicization in this tune, I am not convinced that it modulates at all.
Surely a more concise analysis is possible than the one suggested by Levine.<a href="#FN7" name="FN7REF"><sup>(7)</sup></a></p>

<p>[22] But analysis is not the focus of this book. The real value of Levine&rsquo;s
study derives from his solid understanding of modal improvisation and his vast
knowledge of the recorded jazz literature. Musical examples cover a wide range
of jazz history and styles, but rely heavily on a short list of the author&rsquo;s
favorites, which includes Joe Henderson, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Freddie
Hubbard, and Mulgrew Miller. Bebop musicians, such as Charlie Parker, Dexter
Gordon, Clifford Brown, and Barry Harris, receive little or no mention in this
volume. When earlier or traditional jazz musicians are referred to, it is merely
for the purpose of pointing out early instances or suggestions of the more
advanced harmonic procedures that constitute the focus of this work. Levine
never attempts to understand a solo or passage on its own terms, independent of
stylistic norms and accepted harmonic practice.</p>
<p>[23] The issues touched upon in this review only hint at the vast amount of
material in this book. Particularly insightful are the chapters on
reharmonization, which contain myriad suggestions for chord substitution,
tapping the vast repository of knowledge that Levine has acquired in his career
as a jazz pianist. Interlaced throughout the book, Levine gives practical advice
on practicing and developing improvisational skills, while evident throughout is
his genuine love for the music and his vast listening and performing experience.
If one&rsquo;s interest in jazz theory leans toward procedures and methods, this book
fits the bill perfectly. Although those with an interest in theoretical
explanations will not find their wishes gratified by this volume, they will
nevertheless find in it an invaluable cache of information regarding some of the
most significant harmonic procedures of jazz theory.</p>
