<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In my article, &ldquo;The Two-Length Bar Revisited:  Handel and the
Hemiola&rdquo; (<i>G&ouml;ttinger H&auml;ndel-Beitr&auml;ge</i>, Vol. 4 [1991], pages 208&ndash;31),
I attempted to identify several categories of Handelian hemiolas&mdash;cadential, expansion, and contraction hemiolas&mdash;in the hope that their
establishment would help us sort out some of the complexities of
Handel&rsquo;s phrase rhythm (and that of other composers, for that
matter).  I also pointed to several types of hemiola that could not be
readily stratified.  If nothing else, the article demonstrated that the
hemiola could assume a great variety of contextually defined senses. 
The present update is designed to complement my earlier study by
pointing to an additional category&mdash;<i>overlapping hemiolas</i>&mdash;and by
assessing its impact on the surrounding elements of the design.  After
establishing this new category in the first part, I shall seek to revise
two of my earlier readings in the second part and, in closing, point to
several relatively recent studies that illuminate this complex and
elusive subject.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2] Among the difficulties of observing the hemiola and approaching
it from a theoretical or analytical perspective is the high degree of
uncertainty (not to say ambiguity) that surrounds its articulation.  The
compositional environment will often suggest hemiolas by
emphasizing the third beat of a measure (or the second beat in the
following measure) through thematic, textural, harmonic, or registral
stresses of varying impact, but it will not necessarily follow it up with
an explicitly marked hemiola formation.  In other words, it will stop
just short of defining three <i>contiguous</i> long, hemiolic beats (each
divided into two short internal beats, one strong, the other weak) over
the span of two measures in triple meter.  Compounding the
consequent uncertainty is the well-established absence of a
requirement for the hemiola to be articulated by both outer voices: 
The bass may not necessarily support the suggestion of a hemiola by
the upper voice, and the upper voice will not necessarily corroborate
its realization by the bass.  Especially in such cases, the emphases
articulating the hemiola will accrue largely through a series of design
stresses&mdash;rhythmic accents that (as just intimated) are due to melodic,
textural, harmonic, or registral intensification of purely local origin,
at the very surface.  In borderline instances, it is up to such design
accents to try and supplant the metrical accents of the notated meter,
whose supporting grid extends to deeper levels of durational structure. 
And indeed, there are many cases where it is in fact the notated meter
that wins out.  (On the other hand, the presence of several
hemiolas may foster parallelisms that will reinforce the design
stresses in potentially ambiguous passages.)  Since not all voices
necessarily participate in the hemiolic activity, the hemiola&rsquo;s
effect on the composition&rsquo;s harmonic rhythm and other underlying paces
will vary considerably from one hemiola to another.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Overlapping Hemiolas</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="willner_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="willner_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[3] The formation I call overlapping hemiolas, which may be defined
as a set of two hemiolas collapsed onto three measures, makes use of
just this possibility of articulating the hemiola incompletely; see
<b>Example 1</b>, which also depicts the possibility of a third overlapping
hemiola, sometimes found in Bach and occasionally in Handel. The formation often begins, somewhat unexpectedly and perhaps furtively,
at a distance of three, rather than two, bars from the closing cadential
progression of a phrase or subphrase, namely at the beginning of the
group.  Its location lends it a thematic weight different in nature, if not
in emphasis or impact, from that of hemiolas that appear closer to the
cadential chords of the group in question; its length allows it to shape
the entire group in a way no single hemiola could.  (Single hemiolas
may, of course, also appear at the beginning of a group without being
followed by an overlapping hemiola.)</p>

<p>[4] In the first bar of the formation, two-beat patterns in the soprano
or bass (or in both) briefly contradict the notated meter and establish
the first hemiola.  In the second bar, the hemiola&rsquo;s articulation
becomes uncertain, as the broken stems in Example 1 show.  On the
one hand, the metrical accent on the first beat is not attenuated to the
same degree it usually is in hemiola formations; on the other, the
expected stress on the second beat is elided or contradicted by adjacent
stresses.  The first two beats of the second measure may be regarded
as a grey area, a durational &ldquo;pivot zone,&rdquo; that plays host to two events:
the premature peroration of the first hemiola, and the sly entrance
of the second hemiola.  For the second hemiola enters, however
surreptitiously, at the downbeat of this second measure; it now begins
to make its presence known.  As a result, the first hemiola&rsquo;s division
of long hemiolic beats into strong and weak internal beats undergoes
metrical reinterpretation, as the diagram of accentual conflicts at the
bottom of Example 1 demonstrates.  The first hemiola&rsquo;s conclusion
thus assumes a jagged and unsettled quality, a sense of tentative and
incomplete realization that may have significant repercussions for the
metrical design in the phrases and sections that follow.  Once the third
measure has been reached, the outline of the second hemiola emerges
quite clearly.  Because it is usually the second hemiola that enlists the
cadential support of the bass, it brings the formation to a decisive
close and at the same time sends out the signal that it has neutralized
and absorbed the first hemiola.</p>

<p>[5] To illustrate the foregoing explanation and its more extended
ramifications, I should like to offer several observations on the
appearance of overlapping hemiolas in the Sarabande from Handel&rsquo;s
G-minor Suite of 1720.  The Sarabande opens with a four-bar
subphrase that strikes an immediately memorable impression by
replacing the expected, largely stepwise outlines of the typical
sarabande melody with a series of bold leaps; see the braces in
<b>Example 2</b>. While these help underscore the Sarabande&rsquo;s four-bar
grouping they also prevent it from assuming the predictable melodic
contours of the genre.  The overlapping hemiolas occupy bars 5&ndash;7,
much of the second four-bar subphrase (<b>Example 3</b>).</p>

<p>[6] The two-chord patterns in bars 5&ndash;6 begin to establish a hemiola and
continue through to the downbeat of bar 6 (see the brackets atop
Example 3).  The melodic line&rsquo;s two pairs of descending thirds, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5&ndash;D5 and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&ndash;C5, are supported by rising fourths in the
bass, D3&ndash;G3 and C3&ndash;F3.  Together, melody and bass articulate an 
S&ndash;W, S&ndash;W formation that reaches into the beginning of bar 6.  The 
progression stands out&mdash;and can superimpose a hemiolic interpretation 
over the notated meter&mdash;because it comprises the Sarabande&rsquo;s first 
genuinely harmonic progressions spanning only two internal beats each, 
and because it suggests a durational contraction (as well as a harmonic 
realization) of the longer, contrapuntally conceived progressions that 
straddle the barline at the turn of bars 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>[7] At the downbeat of bar 6, then, two events overlap:  The statement
of the hemiola&rsquo;s fourth, weak internal beat, and the beginning of an
unexpectedly sustained F-major chord, whose continuation through
the second beat of the measure supports the notated meter as
established in bars 1&ndash;4 and generates what Joel Lester called a
&ldquo;durational accent.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  Not only is the fifth, strong internal beat
of the hemiola elided&mdash;it is subsequently contradicted by the third beat
of bar 6, which initiates a faster melodic pace of quarter notes.  The
group of quarter notes, supported by a strong cadential progression
in the bass, straddles the downbeat of bar 7 and describes a typical
cadential hemiola (<a href:"../mto.96.2.3/mto.96.2.3.willnr3.gif">Example 3</a>).  The gradual realization of this second
hemiola, then, overlaps the equally gradual peroration of the first
hemiola; both realization and peroration are the subject matter of bar
6, whose first two beats emerge as the &ldquo;pivot zone&rdquo; referred to earlier.
Note how the movement in parallel tenths, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&ndash;D5
(upper voice) and D3&ndash;C3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 (bass), established by the first
hemiola, is completed not on the second beat of bar 6 but on the third,
lending further weight to the emerging second hemiola.</p>

<p>[8] Because the overlapping hemiolas span three bars and occupy the
greater part of a four-bar subphrase, the temporary metrical
uncertainty they portray in their central measure has the potential for
creating a genuine disturbance in the rhythmic flux of the piece.  To
foster a compositional and rhetorical milieu in which such disturbance
will realize its assigned effect without appearing out of line, Handel
often prepares the onset of overlapping hemiolas in some way during
the preceding passages and then only gradually allows them to
dissipate in the phrase or phrases that follow.  By the time their
peroration is completed, then, their very presence in the piece, as such,
will likely have promoted additional rhythmic dialectics, and these
might have in turn become intimately linked to the compositional
essence of the piece.</p>

<p>[9] The two-chord patterns that launch the first hemiola in bars 5&ndash;6 are
prepared by the falling third <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4&ndash;D4 in bar 4.  Their movement
forward begins with the quasi-improvisatory reappearance of this
falling third in the two-line octave, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5 conspicuously replacing
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 at the turn of bar 5.  The transfer of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> to the high
register and its alteration to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> represents yet another way of
sidestepping excessive thematic predictability within the Sarabande&rsquo;s
periodic framework.</p>

<p>[10] Let us look now at several later allusions to the overlapping
hemiolas; these, too, help prevent the remaining three eight-bar
phrases from outlining an excessively mechanical profile.  Although
the four-bar group that follows the double bar brings back the
rhythmic outlines of bars 1&ndash;4, the unexpected entrance of a two-beat
G major chord on the second beat of bar 12, at the close of the group
(and in the manner of a written-out <i>sforzato</i>), nearly usurps the
cadential status of F, the subtonic that entered on the downbeat of the
measure (see the arrow in <b>Example 4</b>). It is as if Handel insisted on
affirming, following the upheaval of bars 5&ndash;7, that we are indeed
listening to a Sarabande, but that further upheaval is in store for us as
well.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  The resulting metrical imbalance makes it possible for the
new thematic material that enters in bar 13 to chart a more flexible
course than the opening of a foursquare group would normally allow. 
The mysterious quarter-note rests on the third beat of bar 13 and the
second beat of bar 14 represent suppressed accents:  On
account of their proximity they seem jointly to allude to a hemiola, if
not to express one explicitly (see the asterisks in Example 4; the rest in
bar 13, though a reference to the rest in bar 1, is dramatized by its
contradiction of the two-beat G-major chord in bar 12).  As in bar 6,
earlier, their more decisive continuation&mdash;namely, at the third beat of
bar 14&mdash;establishes a typical cadential hemiola (bars 14&ndash;15).  Like the
cadential hemiola of bars 6&ndash;7, this new hemiola absorbs the
uncertainties of bars 13&ndash;14.  One could, then, view the events in bars
13&ndash;15 as a partly silent, hidden reminiscence of those in bars 5&ndash;7. 
Given the relative surface regularity of bars 9&ndash;12, which recalls that of
bars 1&ndash;4, one could take the correspondence one step further and
regard the route followed by the Sarabande&rsquo;s second phrase as parallel
to that followed by its first phrase.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>

<p>[11] The uncertainties and tensions of the Sarabande&rsquo;s overlapping
hemiolas find their complete peroration only in its remaining two
phrases (bars 17&ndash;24 and 25&ndash;32).  The subphrase in bars 17&ndash;20 restores
the outlines of bars 1&ndash;4 but forgoes the striking leaps of the first
subphrase in favor of a more traditionally <i>cantabile</i>, conjunct
setting of the characteristic incipit.  The following subphrase, in
bars 21&ndash;24, shows a comparatively mechanical quality (a quality
underscored by the repetition of the same subphrase in bars 29&ndash;32).
The literal transposition of bars 21 and 29 in bars 22 and 30 (a third
higher) underscores the insistence of the subphrase&rsquo;s repeated notes
(A4, C5), as well as the closing impulse of its plainly cadential
hemiolas (bars 22&ndash; 23, 30&ndash;31).  This is Handel&rsquo;s response to the
accentual irregularities occasioned by the overlapping hemiolas:
Though they play their role well, the two subphrases in question count
among the less inspired passages in the 1720 collection of suites (the
Sarabande dates from about 1703&ndash;06, but it was revised for the 1720
publication).  Their slight awkwardness exemplifies the difficulties
Baroque composers faced when, in the course of very short pieces, they
felt need to resolve complex issues they had raised moments earlier
but did not quite have the needed durational space in which to work
out the resolution.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b>.

<p>[12] It is only in the course of bars 25&ndash;28, the first subphrase of the
closing phrase, that a vestige of genuine tension reemerges.  At bar 26,
Handel sidesteps the opportunity to present generic repeated-chord
patterns (in imitation of bars 17ff. and bar 25) and sustains the
second-beat D chord through the end of the measure instead.  Handel
can thereby suggest a &ldquo;hidden hemiola&rdquo; in bars 25&ndash;26 without fully
realizing it.  The seventh chord on G, sustained in different positions
through the second and third beats of bar 25, militates against the
realization of the hemiola (<b>Example 5</b>). Along the same lines, by
beginning bar 27 with two quarter notes, Handel evokes the preceding
cadential hemiola (that of bars 22&ndash;23) without really articulating it (cf.
the brackets in Example 5).  As a group, bars 25&ndash;27 thus portray an
attenuated rhythmic reference to the Sarabande&rsquo;s temporal
peculiarities (the suggestion of hemiolic closure in bars 26 and 27 not
being matched by that of hemiolic opening in bars 25 or 26), but at the
same time they steer clear of the peculiarities&rsquo; actual portrayal&mdash;a
signal indication that the turbulence of the Sarabande&rsquo;s temporality
has finally reached the point of complete peroration.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  Though not
as elegant as its introduction, Handel&rsquo;s resolution of the Sarabande&rsquo;s
durational dialectic is emblematic of the dynamic, improvisatory
nature of Baroque style, and it embodies a measure of compositional
freedom missing perhaps from his later, more closely integrated
compositions.</p>

<p>[13] I should like to take the opportunity of writing again about the
hemiola to modify my account of the hemiola formations in two of the
pieces I presented in &ldquo;The Two-Length Bar Revisited&rdquo;:  Those in the
Courante from Handel&rsquo;s F minor Suite, and those in the Musette from
the G minor Concerto Grosso, Op. 6 No. 6 (Examples 3 and 4 in that
article).  Even though the hemiolas in each piece appear at the close of
a phrase, one could make a plausible case for reading them as
constellations of overlapping hemiolas.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>.

<p>[14] In bars 17&ndash;19 of the Courante (<b>Example 6</b> in the present essay),
the upper voice&rsquo;s first hemiola (bars 17&ndash;18) is self-evident; that an
additional, overlapping hemiola spans bars 18&ndash;19 in the upper voice
is suggested by the entrance of the bass G at the turn of bar 18, which
underscores the downbeat of the measure, by the subsequent emphasis
on the supertonic <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord on the third beat of bar 18, and by the
articulation of the dominant&rsquo;s <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> resolution on the first two beats
of bar 19, which places substantial motivic weight on the second beat
of that measure. The succession of these events suggests a metric
reinterpretation similar to that displayed in the present Example 1.</p>

<p>[15] Though it is the second, rather than the first, hemiola that is
relatively tentative here&mdash;its interpretation is supported by the
grouping of the upper voice but contradicted by the return of the bass
tone G at the beginning of bar 19&mdash;the durationally angular
setting of the three-bar segment and its collection of conflicting
accents does evoke the thematic and rhythmic contraction typical of
overlapping hemiolas and as such assumes growing significance in the
course of the piece.  First introduced as the climax to a set of imitative
entrances of the Courante&rsquo;s short theme over the dominant (bars 10&ndash;
14&ndash;17), it reappears in the form of seemingly incidental allusions to the
tentative hemiola of bars 18&ndash;19 during the cadential progression of
bars 27&ndash;29 and, more concretely, in the progression of bars 30&ndash;32 (and,
transposed but complete, in bars 41&ndash;43).</p>

<p>[16] The overlapping hemiolas in the Musette from the G minor
Concerto Grosso (bars 11&ndash;13) stand, by contrast, on nearly equal
footing (bars 1&ndash;15 are quoted in <b>Example 7</b> of the present article; my
new analytical observations are illustrated in Examples 8&ndash;10). The first hemiola is outlined by three pairs of chords whose articulation of
strong and weak internal beats&mdash;SW, SW, SW&mdash;supports their
contrapuntal and harmonic priorities.  The first chord of each pair
acts as an accented appoggiatura to the second.  The metrical
reinterpretation that takes place in the course of bar 12 is made
possible by this contrapuntal and harmonic function:  As bar 12
unfolds, the second chord of each pair is reinterpreted accentually as
the principal chord of the pair.  The primacy of the rising fourths in
the bass in bars 11&ndash;12 is gradually replaced by that of the falling thirds
in bars 12&ndash;13, which are supported by the melody&rsquo;s movement in
parallel tenths with the bass beginning at the downbeat of bar 12.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
The reinterpretation is possible, indeed necessary, because at a deeper
level the bass tone <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, introduced by the first chordal pair in bar
11, is retained across bar 12 through to the downbeat of bar 13; its
retention possesses substantial harmonic significance in that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>supports the first-inversion supertonic of the Musette theme&rsquo;s closing
cadential progression (<b>Example 8</b> of the present article). Both the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and C of the bass in bar 12 gain in accentual
importance because they help extend <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> through an ascent to the
supertonic&rsquo;s inner-voice tone C, a third above, and in so doing
gradually define the contour of the expanded cadential progression
that spans bars 11&ndash;13 (closing in bar 14).  By the time the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>dominant enters on the second beat of bar 13, it has gained its
requisite hemiolic strong accent.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>


<p>[17] The effect of a hemiola depends in large measure on its relation to
the prevailing rhythmic and thematic design.  From this perspective,
the Musette&rsquo;s overlapping hemiolas are particularly noteworthy for
they introduce the third change in design within the six- and eight-bar
groups in which they occur (bars 1&ndash;6 and 7&ndash;14; the hemiolas are first
suggested, in germinal form, by the chordal pairs in bars 5&ndash;6).  The
Musette&rsquo;s incipit, which moves in quarter notes (bars 1&ndash;2, 7&ndash;8), is
followed by an extraordinary rising slide to a sustained <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (bars 3,
7) and a responding, falling slide to a sustained <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>; the slides
represent displaced contractions of the quarter-note incipit (<b>Example
9</b>). The hemiolas (incipiently in bars 5&ndash;6, fully in bars 11&ndash;13)
reintroduce the movement in quarter notes but contradict their earlier
grouping in threes through the hemiolas&rsquo; characteristic articulation in
pairs.  The expansive nature of the dialogue between the <i>concertino</i>
and <i>ripieno</i> groups that follows&mdash;and many of the ensuing tonal and
durational enlargements&mdash;throughout the movement arise
from the need to work out and then dissipate the tensions resulting
from this uncommonly close succession of changes in design and, in
particular, from the effects of contraction occasioned by the slides and
the chordal pairs.</p>

<p>[18] To my original remarks regarding the influence the passage exerts
on the rest of the Musette I should like to add also the observation
that durational groupings in the Musette&rsquo;s extended developmental
passages are remarkably regular.  Like the brief spurt of periodicity
that follows the double bar in the F-minor Courante and the growing
accentual conformity of the G-minor Sarabande, they mitigate the
accentual uncertainties of the earlier, thematic hemiolas.  More
important, later allusions to the chordal pairs that originally
introduced the overlapping hemiolas present them in an expanded
state, their ascending bass fourths altered to ascending fifths (bars 49&ndash;
53, <b>Example 10</b> in the present article). The bass line carrying the
ascending fifths rises, like the bass line that carried the hemiolas&rsquo;
original ascending fourths, from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> to F and G; instead of
continuing up to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, though, it quickly falls back to F and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. 
By allowing each chord to occupy a full measure rather than just a
quarter note, Handel sidesteps the questions that marked the original
progression and paves the way for the introduction of altogether new
tensions in the stormy C minor section that is to follow.  It is perhaps
a mere coincidence&mdash;but what a wonderful coincidence&mdash;that the C
minor section (bars 81ff.) opens, as well, with a rising fifth in the bass,
which ascends from tonic to dominant; however common and, in this
instance, isolated from a sequential setting, the progression
nonetheless carries a recollection of the earlier sequence (Example 10).</p>

<p>[19] The hemiola, to be sure, occupies a special place in the Handelian
repertoire, but its cultivation as a durational and tonal resource with
consequences ranging well beyond its immediate appearance was
hardly within Handel&rsquo;s exclusive compositional domain.  Overlapping
hemiolas, in particular, appear with great frequency in the music of
J.S. Bach, and especially in Bach&rsquo;s Courantes, Sarabandes, and
Minuets.  Particularly worthy of study are such pieces as the
Sarabande from the G-major Partita for Clavier, in which almost
every four-bar group contains overlapping hemiolas that are expressed
in different ways by different constellations of inner and outer voices.</p>

<p>[20] Although the literature on the hemiola remains modest in scope,
several important studies that shed considerable light on its durational
properties (and offer some intriguing further references) have
appeared in the recent and relatively recent past; I should like to close
by calling them to the reader&rsquo;s attention.</p>

	<h3><a name="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></h3>
	
	<p><a name="FN1">1.</a> I wish to thank Floyd K. Grave for reading both articles and
offering illuminating comments on the intricacies of Handel&rsquo;s G-minor
Sarabande, which I discuss in the course of this study.<br><a href="#FN1REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN2">2.</a> Joel Lester, <i>The Rhythms of Tonal Music</i> (Carbondale and
Edwardsville, Ill.: Southern Illinois University Press, 1986), 3&ndash;4
and 18&ndash;21.  This durational accent is considerably intensified by the
trill embellishing C5, but the trill, which appears in brackets or
parentheses in the most reliable editions, is implicit in Handel&rsquo;s
melodic outline (note the two eighths by which it is followed) rather
than explicit in his text.<br><a href="#FN2REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN3">3.</a> It is possible to find several hemiolic implications in bars 9&ndash;12,
especially across bars 10&ndash;11 and 11&ndash;12.  These, I believe, represent an
allusion to bars 5&ndash;7 that is superseded by the more obvious
parallelisms among the second-beat emphases throughout the passage. 
The emphases win out (as we shall presently see) on account of the
stronger need to evoke the durational design of bars 1&ndash;4.<br><a href="#FN3REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN4">4.</a> Floyd K. Grave (private communication) has suggested that the
Sarabande rhythm&rsquo;s second-beat emphasis comes into its own in bars
13&ndash;15 and persists as an unnotated expression of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> time through the
second beat of bar 15 (the tied <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5 standing for a quarter-note rest
at the beginning of bar 15); and that the sense of an event is
underscored by the entrance of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5 in bar 13.  The melodic peak of
the Sarabande, it also contradicts the inner-voice <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>4 of bar 12
in much the same way that the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5 of bar 5 contradicted the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 of bar 4.  These wonderful observations are by no means
incompatible with mine and reflect the extraordinary richness of
meaning with which Handel invests the surface&mdash;particularly
remarkable in view of the substantial rests and static F-minor
harmony (also pointed out by Grave) that pervade the passage.<br><a href="#FN4REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN5">5.</a> The hemiolic implications of bars 25&ndash;27 echo those of bars 10&ndash;12
(see footnote 3, above) but they are more explicitly articulated owing to the
intensified activity on the third beat of bar 25.<br><a href="#FN5REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN6">6.</a> Like most of Handel&rsquo;s Courantes, the piece under discussion is really
a Corrente, but Handelians&mdash;unlike Bach scholars&mdash;persist in using the
French term even when the Italian is clearly preferable. To maintain
Handelian consistency, I retain the French form here.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> Bar 12 includes the overlapping hemiolas&rsquo; grey area, their &ldquo;pivot
zone,&rdquo; spanning beats 1 and 2.  Our retrospective interpretation of the
area&rsquo;s metrical disposition allows the chords on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and C (beats 1
and 3) to assert their accentual primacy over the appoggiatura-like
chords by which they are preceded.  The parallel tenths between the
outer voices in bars 12&ndash;13 allow both performers and listeners to
absorb the accentual reinterpretation in a fluent, unforced way. 
Paradoxically, both appearances of the underlying <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (bar 11, beat
2; bar 13, beat 1) are metrically weaker than those of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and C,
which prolong <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>; but the metrical weakness of structural chords
following their introduction by sequential appoggiatura chords and
preceding the appearance of still more structural chords (such as the
dominant on beats 2 and 3 of bar 13) is quite common.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> Similar pairs of hemiolic chords appear as an idiom under more
straightforward circumstances throughout the Classical era. In their
later formation, they extend for four&mdash;rather than three&mdash;bars, and
therefore divide into two sets of complete hemiolas.  See, for instance,
the second movement from Haydn&rsquo;s Keyboard Sonata in D, No. 61
[Hoboken XVI: 51], bars 31&ndash;34, for a particularly dramatic example;
or the Menuet from Haydn&rsquo;s Symphony No. 99 in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, bars 52&ndash;55. 
Though they don&rsquo;t occur very frequently, such groups of successive
hemiolas are by no means uncommon in the Classical style (see also
Mozart&rsquo;s Little Gigue in G, K. 574, which incorporates successive
hemiolas in its principal thematic material as a well-known borrowing
of similar hemiolas from the Gigue of Handel&rsquo;s F-minor Suite).  For
a set of genuine late 18th-century overlapping hemiolas see Mozart&rsquo;s
Piano Concerto in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, K. 595, third movement, bars 51&ndash;52; the
hemiolas appear in the bass line, extending from the middle of bar 51
through the end of bar 52 (the movement is in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>6</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> time, and the
hemiolas span the duration of what would be three bars in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> time).
Canonic hemiolas in the Menuetto from Mozart&rsquo;s G-minor Symphony,
K. 550, that in some ways resemble overlapping hemiolas are discussed
by Richard Cohn (<a href="#cohn_1992" id="citation_cohn_1992_67dc9bd063489">1992</a>), pages 22&ndash;26, Example 7 (bars 28&ndash;36).  Canonic hemiolas
occur in different voices; overlapping hemiolas are usually
collapsed onto a single voice or onto several voices moving
simultaneously.<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><div id="fndiv1" class="flyoverdiv">I wish to thank Floyd K. Grave for reading both articles and
