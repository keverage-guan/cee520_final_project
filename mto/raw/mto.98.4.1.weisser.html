<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] David Cope (Professor of Music, University of California, Santa
Cruz) is a composer who is perhaps best known as the author of a
series of textbooks dealing with various aspects of contemporary
music.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> His <i>Techniques of the Contemporary Composer</i> represents at
once an updating, an elaboration, and a pedagogically-oriented
codification of material presented in previous books.
<p> 

[2] In many respects the aspirations of this book are quite
admirable. Cope aims to provide a resource of twentieth-century (and,
as he writes in his introduction, &ldquo;early twenty-first century&rdquo;)
compositional techniques which can be used both as a reference by
composers and scholars and as an introductory guide for the engaged
contemporary music listener.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> In its sheer scope, one can think only
of a work such as Henry Cowell&rsquo;s <i>New Musical Resources</i> that attempts
to cover as much ground as does Cope.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> <i>Techniques of the
Contemporary Composer</i> is a useful resource if only for the novelty of
the large amount and variety of techniques and issues addressed in the
space of a single text.
<p> 

[3] <i>Techniques of the Contemporary Composer</i> is divided into twenty-one
chapters, preceded by an introduction and followed by an extensive
bibliography. Each chapter is roughly 10&ndash;20 pages in length and
presents a very cursory treatment of the subject matter at hand (which
becomes especially superficial when Cope is dealing with broader
topics such as tonality, serialism, and notation). There are copious
music examples (over 300 examples in the book, all of them by Cope, a
state of affairs I will address further on) and references to
representative works by other composers in each subject.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Each
chapter ends with a set of &ldquo;Composing Suggestions,&rdquo; pieces and
exercises that students may write utilizing germane techniques and
materials. The authorial tone throughout is both incisive and
non-patronizing, always welcoming and encouraging no matter the level
of complexity or abstractness inherent in the basic concepts being
discussed.
<p> 

[4] Several chapters stand out as notable and of potential pedagogical
use.  Chapter 2, The Tonal Legacy, encompasses chromaticism and
polytonality. Chapter 6, Serialism, includes basic row concepts,
combinatoriality, serialism of other parameters besides pitch
(duration, dynamics, tempi, and timbre), pointillistic distribution of
pitch material, and klangfarbenmelodie. This chapter exists in tandem
with chapter 7, Pitch-Class Sets (which quite handily comes with a
chart of the 208 &ldquo;most commonly used&rdquo; pitch-class sets).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Chapter 8,
Rhythm and Meter, covers among other areas metric modulation and
proportional notation. In chapter 9, Texture and Modulations, Cope
uses the term micropolyphony to describe a textural situation
characterized by a simultaneity of different lines, rhythms, and
timbres.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Chapter 10, Microtones, deals with equal temperament,
intonation, and tuning systems. Chapter 14, Indeterminacy, will be
familiar to the reader who has made acquaintance with <i>New Directions
in Music</i>.  Here Cope employs a distinction between &ldquo;Composer
Indeterminacy,&rdquo; where the score is fixed but the outcome of the
generative processes were unforeseen, and &ldquo;Performer Indeterminacy,&rdquo;
where the score sets up a situation whose details of realization are
unforeseen. Also familiar to the reader of <i>New Directions</i> will be
chapter 18, Media Forms. Cope adds the subcategory &ldquo;Virtual Reality&rdquo;
to those of &ldquo;Multimedia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mixed Media,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Intermedia,&rdquo; attempting
to bring up to date material which might have been more relevant
twenty or thirty years ago.  The strongest chapter, I believe, is
chapter 20, Experimental Music, as Cope is on firm ground here and not
merely attempting to cover a wide variety of genres for the purpose of
writing an authoritative textbook. The discussions in this chapter of
&ldquo;Biomusic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Antimusic&rdquo; are particularly fruitful.
<p> 

[5] Though worth having, <i>Techniques of the Contemporary Composer</i>
contains a number of serious flaws which prevent it from being a truly
authoritative source. The most grievous is the fact that Cope composes
his own musical examples rather than reprinting excerpts from other
composers&rsquo; works. I understand that doing this may allow an author to
be more concise, to have his/her examples truly relate to the concept
he/she is trying to convey in a more concrete manner than by
scavenging through a pre-existent score for something that might be
applicable and optimally effective (not to mention, of course, the
legal complications which are avoided by composing one&rsquo;s own
examples). However, when one is endeavoring to explain the prepared
piano, for example, it is simply not enough to reference certain
techniques and then parenthetically cite John Cage&rsquo;s works in the
following manner: (Cage 1944, 1948, 1951). One needs to be able to
consult Cage&rsquo;s introductory preparation tables to works such as
Sonatas and Interludes (1948), as well as score excerpts. The same
weakness applies to virtually every chapter; I cannot imagine how it
would not be preferable to present score excerpts by members of the
Second Viennese and Darmstadt Schools in chapter 6 (Serialism,
pre-and-post 1945 vintages), or Babbitt in chapter 7 (composition with
pitch-class sets), or Carter in chapter 8 (the section on metric
modulation within the larger chapter on rhythm and meter), or Reich in
chapter 19 (the section on phase music within the larger chapter on
Minimalism).  One reason the chapters on media forms and experimental
music are so much stronger is that there is much less of an accepted
canon of works in those genres, making it easier for Cope to compose
his own examples.
<p> 

[6] Other problems with the book have more to do with the very nature
of Cope&rsquo;s enterprise. In attempting to put together a textbook of
twentieth-century techniques, Cope is by definition codifying a series
of movements, manners, and behaviors (often of a radical, iconoclastic
relationship to each other) which resist simple codification and are
often irreconcilable. In his introduction, Cope takes great pains to
dissuade the reader from deriving any sense of progressive narrativity
one might normally ask from a textbook:

<blockquote>
   There is no progress in art<nobr> . . . </nobr>A comparison of progress in the arts
   to, for instance, progress in the sciences is inappropriate.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>It would follow, then, that Cope&rsquo;s book is &ldquo;not<nobr> . . . </nobr>about rules, but
about resources.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> The problem with this, however, is that the
layout and conventional aspects (explicatory music examples, exercises
at the end of chapters, the fact that the twenty-one chapters are
designed to coincide with two semesters of composition study) make the
book seem like it wants to be a straightforward textbook of
twentieth-century compositional techniques. Yet the disposition and
arrangement of material is generally without a sense of narrative
purpose (with the exception of the two chapters on serialism and
pitch-class sets), so the result seems unfocused; it is unclear how
this book would translate into a coherent course syllabus. In adopting
an intermediary, &ldquo;resource-providing&rdquo; stance, Cope has not come to
terms with the ramifications of his materials, and his work pays a
price for it. I am not sure if, at the end of the twentieth-century,
something more is now required.
<p> 

[7] In a number of chapters and categories, one gets the sense that
Cope is grappling with the changed cultural environment of the last
generation. Chapter 21 is entitled &ldquo;Decategorization,&rdquo; and in this
final category Cope attempts to merge a number of previously-discussed
techniques into broad compositional frameworks of eclecticism,
quotation, sectionalization, integration, etc. These sub-categories
are not mutually exclusive, and to treat them in the same formal
manner one treated fourth chords and microtones earlier in the book
strikes me as both rigid and inappropriate. To portray this slice of
musical postmodernism is a very difficult task (especially in the span
of eight pages), and I am not at all sure Cope brings it off.
<p> 

[8] This leads to a larger question: how does one transmit a more
value-neutral, pluralist cultural orientation within a university
environment? The very materials Cope is dealing with in <i>Techniques of
the Contemporary Composer</i> would suggest the formation of an
alternative strategy, yet the conventional, unsatisfying textbook
framework does not enable him to deliver on such promise.  How will
this subject be taught in the next century?  How necessary will much
of the book be, after one has achieved such &ldquo;thoroughness&rdquo;?  How many
of Cope&rsquo;s categories will be relevant?
<p> 

[9] There are other, more local aspects of this book which are
problematic as well. The chapter on pitch-class sets falls into the
trap of being overly analytical in orientation; this will inevitably
serve as a barrier for a young composer in need of material being
presented in as generative a behavioral model as possible. The
material on multiphonics in chapter 12 is disappointing; not only is
it way too cursory, but after having provided the 208 common
pitch-class sets in chapter 7, Cope could have provided a chart of
some common multiphonic fingerings rather than just referencing source
texts such as Bartolozzi&rsquo;s <i>New Sounds for Woodwinds</i>.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Also cursory
is the discussion of MIDI in chapter 16, which gives the impression of
being purely obligatory. I was delighted to see an entire chapter
devoted to algorithmic composition (chapter 17), but a process in
which a work of acoustic music can be generated, permeated, and
informed by a computer algorithm was not presented in a convincing
enough fashion. As someone who frequently consults Cope&rsquo;s <i>New Music
Notation</i>, I find the section on new notations (chapter 13)
surprisingly lacking and incomplete; I recommend the earlier text to
anyone interested in a thorough-going treatment of notational sigla
and performance-practice issues.
<p> 

[10] In summary, <i>Techniques of the Contemporary Composer</i> is a worthy
addition to a contemporary music library. It is to be admired for its
scope and reference value, and would be of a certain value in the
study of composition and relevant disciplines such as
notational/performance practice. However, it should not be adhered to
as an authoritative classroom text, and it should be supplemented
generously with the original scores of the works whose techniques Cope
addresses.</p>
