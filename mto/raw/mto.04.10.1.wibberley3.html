				<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="5"><a style="color:black" href="#AUTHORNOTE1">Roger Wibberley</a></font></span></h2><br><br><p><font size='4'>KEYWORDS: Cents, Costeley, equal temperament, Finale, interval ratio, pitchbend, pitchwheel, Pythagorean, Syntonic comma</font></p><p><font size='4'>ABSTRACT: This essay is explicitly &ldquo;educational&rdquo; in the proper sense: 
although it has a technical focus this is intended to provide the means of 
re-examining and reassessing one&rsquo;s own cognitive processes. It has often been 
argued that a proper understanding of early music is hindered by our own 
inability to &ldquo;hear the music&rdquo; in the way our ancestors did. Our &ldquo;modern&rdquo; ears 
have (it is often rightly said) become conditioned over time by the sound worlds 
of later systems of tuning and performance to the extent that our perception of 
the aesthetics applied to early styles can only be the result of educated 
guesswork. &ldquo;We cannot know how a Pythagorean performance really sounded (can 
we?), and our understanding of the soundscape of Just Intonation (JI) is mainly 
intuitive, backed up perhaps by a complicated theoretical list of mathematical 
ratios (isn&rsquo;t it?).&rdquo; There is considerably more to a performance than accurate 
intonation (which is only the starting point) and this essay (along with the 
previous two) only seeks to explore the particular aspects of performance 
involving pitch. But the above sense of resignation and capitulation can at 
least be partly addressed by examining aspects of tuning, and the procedures 
discussed below will at least provide a means of capturing this single&mdash;albeit 
crucial&mdash;aspect of performance. Nothing will replace a group of well-equipped 
and trained singers, but it is my belief that such singers would need a highly 
specialized training before successfully achieving performances of the kind 
outlined. Even then, the nature of &ldquo;live performance&rdquo; (however accurate 
empirically) may still be the victim of only a subjective response from the 
listener (who is naturally more inclined to trust his or her own preconditioned 
cognitive responses than the results such singers might produce). This essay, 
therefore, provides a computer-generated means of evaluation, and the sounds 
provided are empirically correct in their intonation by all standards proclaimed 
in theoretical works of the time. The challenge, then, is to develop a 
self-critical approach in which&mdash;fully knowing that what is being heard <i>is</i> (intonationally) 
herein the same for us as it was for them&mdash;we can reappraise our own cognition. 
If any tunings that are created by the application of anything covered in the 
essay strike the listener as in any way &ldquo;strange,&rdquo; &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; or &ldquo;unusual,&rdquo; 
this can be taken confidently as a direct invitation to the listener to 
reappraise his or her own cognition.</font></p>

<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In my previous two essays on Syntonic and Pythagorean 
tuning, numerous sound files were included together with graphic files showing 
in visual terms how the various notes in the scores were inflected upwards or 
downwards in order to fine-tune the harmonies according to the principles 
explained therein. The objective here is to show how Finale users can apply the 
same principles and achieve similar results from their own use of Finale.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
What will be included is a downloadable Library file that can be imported into 
Finale and used as described. When this is applied to scores in the way 
specified, playback of files will be accurately tuned according to the user&rsquo;s 
specification. In the case of those who simply wish to apply the file provided, 
much of the essay can be bypassed. But since an understanding of the principles 
will enable the application of other tuning systems (such as, for example, 
quarter-comma meantone), those who might wish to extend their use of tuning 
systems should follow the essay closely.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[2] My own set-up is unremarkable: a Macintosh 
iMac running OS 9, together with a still-serviceable Roland D10 keyboard. All 
the principles and methods outlined in this essay equally apply to PC Windows or 
other Macintosh set-ups, and the downloadable files provided should work 
unhindered by any system using Finale from version 3.7.2 (Mac) onwards and 
equivalent PC Windows versions. Readers will find that a large screen is 
beneficial (though not essential) when working with scores, and when reading 
some of the graphic files contained in this essay. The files I have provided 
have deliberately been created in Finale 3.7.2 for the following reason: while 
users of later versions will find that their programs automatically apply the 
appropriate data transfer to these files, had I presented the items only in 
their newer formats users of early versions would be unable to apply the 
settings. For this reason I shall present numeric values first according to the 
system understood by &ldquo;older versions&rdquo; (e.g. 3.7.2), and then explain how these 
values are modified by &ldquo;newer versions&rdquo; (e.g. Finale 2000 and Finale 2003). 
Nobody using a newer version will, of course, ever have to work out the new 
values since the program itself does all the work. When the appropriate library 
in the downloaded file is Saved, all the changed values will be automatically 
applied by Finale when the file is loaded. Users of early versions also will be 
able to Save the library in its still unchanged format. They will find that if 
they then Load this library (or any music file containing it) into a newer 
version of Finale, the data transfer will be automatic. </p>
<p>
[3] The keyboard that 
you are using will undoubtedly be configured to play in equal temperament.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
The only way in which pitches that are different from the default pitches (set 
by the keyboard used) can be generated is by activating the pitchwheel. The 
pitchwheel will usually be set (by default) to raise or lower the pitch of a 
note by one octave.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Casual (and even seasoned) users of Finale may be unaware 
of the power it offers for playback. There is more than one method of asking 
Finale to alter the pitch of a note it plays from the score, but the method that 
is to be used here is the most accurate and uses the Staff Expression tool.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>


<p>
[4] It will be helpful for you to know whether 
the Finale version you are using is what I shall henceforward call an &ldquo;early 
version&rdquo; as opposed to a &ldquo;later version.&rdquo; This knowledge will not affect your 
use of the files provided, but will help you to follow some of the explanations 
I shall shortly be offering for using the program. Generally an &ldquo;early version&rdquo; 
can be identified from the composition of the main tool palette. If it contains 
both Staff and Score Expression icons (the former indicated by the &ldquo;mf&rdquo; symbol 
and a white note, the latter by an &ldquo;mf&rdquo; symbol alone), this will be an &ldquo;early 
version.&rdquo; An example is illustrated in 
<b>Figure 1</b>, as used in Finale 3.7.2. 
If, 
however, your main tool palette contains only a single Expression Tool 
(indicated by an icon bearing only the &ldquo;mf&rdquo; symbol) you will be using a &ldquo;later 
version.&rdquo; Such palettes are shown in <b>Figures 2</b> (Finale 2000) and <b>3</b> (Finale 
2003). </p>

[5] The Expression tool (both &ldquo;staff&rdquo; and &ldquo;score&rdquo; in early versions) is normally 
used in order to insert dynamics into the score. It is important that when this 
method of tuning is used it is always applied to individual notes on a selected 
staff. This will mean that users of early versions will select the Staff 
Expression Tool, while users of later versions will prescribe this from the 
submenus that appear after selecting the common Expression Tool. This will 
ensure that the marking to be inserted only affects the actual note(s) to be 
changed. In order at this stage to understand what is going to be done using 
this tool to provide for pitch changes to individual notes, it will be helpful 
now to load a Finale file in order to explore the (Staff) Expression tool in the 
manner to be outlined next. </p>
<p>
[6] USERS OF &ldquo;LATER VERSIONS&rdquo; SHOULD HERE SKIP TO 
[7] below. With a Finale file open, select the Staff Expression tool and click 
on any note in the score to open the Staff Expression box.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> There will be all 
the current dynamic markings that are available, although these themselves are 
not going to be used. Select any of those available and then click the EDIT 
button. The next box that opens should also contain a section headed &ldquo;Playback 
Options,&rdquo; but if it does not simply click the button marked &ldquo;Show Playback 
Options.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Playback Options&rdquo; window that is now visible there is a 
drop-down selection menu next to the word &ldquo;Type&rdquo; which allows the user to make 
various kinds of settings that affect playback. When the drop-down menu is 
opened the type to be selected is &ldquo;Pitchwheel.&rdquo; Having selected &ldquo;Pitchwheel&rdquo; 
there is also a &ldquo;Set to&rdquo; radio button that should be selected. A numeric value 
now needs to be inserted into the box alongside this &ldquo;Set to&rdquo; button. It is at 
this point that a value can be inserted into the box to specify exactly what the 
pitchbend value for the particular Staff Expression originally selected will be. 
This value will determine the pitch inflection of the note to be sounded.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>
[7] USERS OF &ldquo;OLDER VERSIONS&rdquo; SHOULD SKIP TO [8] below. Later versions require 
the selection of the common Expression Tool (&ldquo;mf&rdquo;). When a note in the 
previously-opened score is selected the next window displays the current 
expression marks. Select one, and then click &ldquo;note attached&rdquo; or &ldquo;note 
expression&rdquo; (according to version). When the &ldquo;Select&rdquo; button is clicked, the 
next window will present the playback options, and from the &ldquo;Type&rdquo; submenu 
should be selected &ldquo;pitchwheel.&rdquo; A numeric value needs to be inserted into the 
adjoining box, and this value will determine the exact pitch inflection that 
Finale will apply on playback. Now click the various &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; button to return 
to the score. </p>
<p>
[8] The question is, of course, what should the pitchwheel &ldquo;set 
to&rdquo; values be? What is required is a completely new library of text expressions, 
each of which has a programmed pitchbend value that has been accurately created 
and inserted as described above. More specific understanding of the keyboard 
pitchwheel and the way Finale operates it is needed, first of all, and then an 
understanding of how the values to be inserted are calculated. In older versions 
of Finale the default pitchwheel value is 8192; when the pitchwheel is at its 
lowest pitch (having been pushed to the left) Finale&rsquo;s pitchwheel value is 0; 
and when the pitchwheel is at its highest point (being pushed to the right) 
Finale&rsquo;s value is 16384 (i.e. 8192 multiplied by 2). The range in older versions 
is therefore 0-8192 and 8192-16384 (the former giving the range of pitches below the default, and the latter those above). In 
later versions, however, these numbers have been changed, the default value now 
being set to 0 (zero), and the respective numeric ranges are therefore -8192-0 
and 0-8192.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> This means that Finale is capable of dividing the interval 
covered by the pitchwheel (pushed either upwards or downwards) into 8192 equal 
portions. Although this may seem generous for tuning purposes, it is actually 
insufficient for the purpose of accurate pitch changes as small as a Syntonic 
comma as long as the pitch bend set on the keyboard covers a whole octave.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
What is needed is the facility of splitting the interval of a <i>semitone</i> 
(rather than an octave) into this number of divisions. This will provide the 
facility for generating pitches accurate to within 1 part in 8192 parts of one 
semitone. </p>
<p>
[9] In order, therefore, to 
reduce the pitchbend range from an octave to a semitone, the bend setting needs 
changing <i>on the keyboard</i> itself. Editing the bend value is simple but the 
procedure depends upon the specification of the keyboard in use.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Whatever 
sounds (patches) are going to be used for playback from Finale need individually 
editing on the keyboard, and the bend value for each needs setting to &ldquo;1.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
The accuracy that Finale will generate will therefore not be corrupted by 
incorrect bend settings within the keyboard itself. </p>
<p>
[10] 
What now needs to be provided is a Finale Text Expression file that in effect 
significantly increases the number of separate pitches available for each 
octave. The object is to create a tool that enables vocal performance to be 
simulated, and this is something that was never available on keyboards of fixed 
pitches.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Since each of the 
twelve notes available on the keyboard now needs to be capable of delivering at 
least three different pitches separated by a Syntonic comma, the Text Expression 
library will need to provide for this. The default scale within which such pitch 
inflection occurs will, however, be purely Pythagorean since it is from these 
Pythagorean pitches that comma inflection upwards or downwards has to take 
place. So in addition to the pure Pythagorean intervals of the 4th, 5th and 
octave, pure 3rds and 6ths will be added to the system by the facility of 
modifying as necessary standard Pythagorean pitches by comma inflection. The 
first stage in constructing this new library of pitches is therefore to devise 
the values needed for the default Pythagorean scale. </p>
<h3>
PYTHAGOREAN TUNING </h3>
<p>
[11] I shall henceforward show 
numeric values for both &ldquo;older&rdquo; and &ldquo;later&rdquo; versions of Finale as follows: 
&ldquo;later versions&rdquo; will appear in square brackets following the values for &ldquo;older&rdquo; 
versions. It will always be noted that the values of the former are the same as 
those of the latter <i>minus 8192</i>.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[12] In constructing the Pythagorean 
scale each existing note on the equally-tempered MIDI keyboard needs to be 
allotted an exact mathematical value such that when Finale plays a note with the 
value defined its pitch will be exactly the one required by the scale. In effect 
what this library will be doing is retuning the separate pitches of the scale so 
that they will all have a Pythagorean relationship instead of an 
equally-tempered one. What needs to be calculated is the exact amount by which 
each separate note has to be raised or lowered from its equally-tempered default 
when it is played by Finale. These defaults will all have a pitchwheel value of 
8192 [0],<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> and the Pythagorean values will therefore be slightly more or less 
than this value depending upon the position of the note within the scale. A 
correct way of arriving at exact Pythagorean values is to take a starting note 
with the default value of 8192 [0], and then a) move upwards through a series of 
perfect fifths sharpwards, and b) move downwards through a corresponding chain 
of perfect fifths flatwards. Taking the note &ldquo;C&rdquo; as the starting point, the 
first deduction will move sharpwards through the fifths ending with A-sharp, while the 
second deduction will move from the same starting note flatwards through the 
fifths to end on C-flat. When this process has been completed all the &ldquo;white 
notes&rdquo; will have their correct pitches, and all the &ldquo;black notes&rdquo; will exist 
with two pitches separated by a Pythagorean comma. Sharps will thereby lie a 
major semitone higher than their parent naturals, and flats a major semitone 
lower than theirs. This will then provide for all the notes required by the 
combined use of <i>musica recta</i> and <i>musica ficta</i>. The octave will have been 
provided with 18 notes instead of the usual 12. As we shall see, however, 18 
notes to the octave will be too few to permit Just Intonation which additionally 
requires the raising and lowering of these default Pythagorean notes by Syntonic 
commas. But this is nonetheless the starting point for arriving at the required 
scale.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[13] To create 
precise Pythagorean pitches for the scale, it must be remembered that the notes 
are initially set on the keyboard to Equal Temperament. As such each note in the 
score will have a default Finale pitchwheel value of 8192 [0]. Only when this 
value is, for each separate note, raised or lowered by the exact value required 
will the Pythagorean scale come into being. And it is only when this new scale 
has been created that the addition or subtraction of comma values can be made 
with precision. When this scale, together with the comma values to be applied to 
it, has been constructed, it will then be possible to edit scores by adding the 
prescribed playback Text Expressions and achieve a playback in Just Intonation. 
The first task, therefore, is to construct an accurate Pythagorean scale. </p>
<p>
[14] 
Because the task is to create audible pitches rather than to calculate relative 
string lengths, it is necessary to work in Cents rather than string length 
ratios.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Since construction of 
the Pythagorean scale is (as stated in [11] above) achieved by computing pure 
fifths in a chain upwards, and then downwards, it is therefore necessary to 
define the exact number of Cents required between successive notes that lie a 
fifth apart. Since we already know that by default each equally-tempered 
semitone contains 100 Cents, and therefore that the equally-tempered fifth 
contains 700 Cents, all we will need to do is to subtract 700 from the total 
number of Cents calculated for the interval overall to find the difference 
between the equally-tempered and the Pythagorean pitches of the note concerned. 
We shall also need to convert Cents value into pitchwheel value which is very 
simple: since the equally-tempered semitone (set on the keyboard) has a 
pitchwheel range of 8192 (being either 0-8192 [-8192-0] or 8192-16384 [0-8192]), 
it must follow that each Cent has a pitchwheel value of 81.92. When, therefore, 
the difference in Cents between an equally-tempered and a Pythagorean fifth is 
calculated, the Cents difference needs to be multiplied by 81.92, and the result 
added to (when moving upwards) or subtracted from (when moving downwards) the 
default pitchwheel value of 8192 [0]. This will yield the new pitchwheel value 
for the note that now lies a Pythagorean fifth above or below the note from 
which the calculation was made. </p>
<p>
[15] All the new pitchwheel settings 
can easily be calculated when the formula for conversion from string-length 
ratio to Cents is applied. This formula is very simple: where the interval-ratio 
required is &ldquo;i&rdquo; and the Cents value sought is &ldquo;c,&rdquo; the conversion is achieved as 
follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>c = log (i) * (1200/log (2)) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
By applying these principles to calculate 
the pitchwheel setting for &ldquo;G,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> and taking &ldquo;C&rdquo; as the starting point with a 
normal pitchwheel setting of 8192 [0], the value for &ldquo;G&rdquo; will be arrived at as 
follows: </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>the pitchwheel value of C (8192 [0]) is the starting point; </li>
  <li>the 
number of Cents required to arrive at G is log(3:2) X 1200/log 2; </li>
  <li>the 
difference between what G would have been (700 Cents greater than C) and what it 
now is as the result of b) above, is the total Cents value given in b) minus 700 
(the number of Cents it would have been); </li>
  <li>this difference is multiplied by 
81.92 (the pitchwheel value of each Cent); </li>
  <li>the result of d) above is added to 
8192 [0] (which would have been the default value). </li>
</ol>
<p>The complete formula for 
this calculation is therefore as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>FOR OLDER VERSIONS: 8192+(((log(3/2)) 
* ((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92) = 8352. </p>
  <p>FOR LATER VERSIONS: 0+(((log(3/2)) * 
((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92)=160 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pitchwheel setting for &ldquo;G&rdquo; is therefore 
8352 (older versions) or 160 (later versions).<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[16] Having now determined the value of the first fifth in the chain sharpwards, 
the same formula is applied each time the next fifth in the chain is calculated. 
The only difference will be the starting value. When the G was calculated from 
the C, the starting value was that for the C (8192 [0]). The result for the G 
was 8352 [160], and this new result now becomes the starting point for 
calculating the value for D using otherwise the same formula: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>OLDER 
VERSIONS: 8352+(((log(3/2)) * ((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92) = 8512 </p>
  <p>LATER 
VERSIONS: 160+(((log(3/2)) * ((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92) = 320 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In then 
calculating the value for A, the starting point will next be the new value for D 
(8512 [320]). This process simply continues through the fifths sharpwards as far 
as D-sharp. </p>
<p>
[17] The pitches that remain are those to be calculated in the chain 
of fifths flatwards from the C. The formula is almost identical, and only the 
first operand differs (since the movement is now flatwards). The calculation for 
F will take the value of C as the starting point, and the formula will now be: 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>OLDER VERSIONS: 8192-(((log(3/2)) * ((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92) = 8032 </p>
  <p>LATER 
VERSIONS: 0-(((log(3/2)) * ((1200/log(2))-700) * 81.92) = -160 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The old starting 
figure for C (8192 [0]) is now replaced with the new one for F (8032 [-160]) to 
find the value of B-flat. This process continues flatwards through the fifths 
until C-flat is reached. When this has been completed, the whole series of 
Pythagorean pitchwheel settings will have been determined. These are now given 
below (the figures appearing in square brackets being those that apply to later 
versions of Finale, and being equivalent in purpose and function to those given 
first for older versions): </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>C: 8192 [0] <br>
  D: 8512 [320] <br>
  E: 8832 [640] <br>
  F: 8032 
[-160] <br>
  G: 8352 [160] <br>
  A: 8672 [480] <br>
  B: 8992 [800] <br>
  B-flat: 7872 [-320] <br>
  E-flat: 
7712 [-480] <br>
  A-flat: 7552 [-640] <br>
  D-flat: 7392 [-800] <br>
  G-flat: 7232 [-960] <br>
  C-flat: 
7072 [-1120] <br>
  F-sharp: 9152 [960] <br>
  C-sharp: 9312 [1120] <br>
  G-sharp: 9472 [1280] 
<br>
  D-sharp: 9632 [1440] <br>
    A-sharp: 9792 [1600] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Files created in early versions that 
are given the first values shown will, when loaded into later versions, have 
these values automatically changed to those appearing in square brackets. When 
creating new settings for early and late versions of Finale respectively, care 
must be taken to ensure that the correct data set is used: older versions using 
the pitchwheel range of 0-8192-16384, and later versions -8192-0-8192. There are 
consequently 18 different pitches in this system for each octave. </p>
<p>
[18] To create 
an accurate playback of these values, and achieve true Pythagorean tuning, the 
procedures outlined in [5] to [7] above should now be followed. In the 
Expression window of Finale, it would be best to delete all existing expressions 
(unless you still to wish to use any of them, which is unlikely). For each 
Pythagorean pitch it is necessary to Create a new Text Expression entry in which 
is applied a) a convenient name tag, and b) a playback definition in which &ldquo;Pitchwheel&rdquo; 
is selected from the drop-down menu and the appropriate value (in the list 
above) typed into the box. The name tag is what will appear in your score when 
you apply the appropriate Text Expression to each of the notes in turn, and it 
should be kept clear and simple. The &ldquo;white notes&rdquo; can simply use the letter 
name (e.g. A, B, C etc.), and the flat notes can be supplied with a &ldquo;b&rdquo; after 
the letter (e.g. Bb, Gb etc.). The sharps should not however use the hash sign 
(#) because this is reserved in Finale.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
In this essay, and the supporting files, I have replaced the hash sign with &ldquo;$,&rdquo; 
so F-sharp is tagged as &ldquo;F$.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
[19] Once the new Text Expression library 
containing the Pythagorean playback values has been completed, each note in the 
score will need to be supplied with its appropriate Text Expression tag. 
Although this is labor intensive, it is a labor of love!<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> It is absolutely 
crucial, however, to make sure that each voice part is programmed by Finale to 
use a <i>different channel</i> for playback otherwise cross-contamination of playback 
values will occur.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> The same 
actual sound (patch) can be used with no ill effect, but different lines must 
remain assigned to different playback channels. </p>


<p>
[20] In order to illustrate the method of insertion to yield tuned playback, 
here are provided some screen shots from three different versions of Finale. The 
music file used (the same in each case) was created by version 3.7.2 (the 
earliest of the examples) and has been loaded into each version to illustrate 
the method of insertion. The first note in the highest staff is A, and the task 
in each case is to insert an instruction to play the note back at its 
Pythagorean pitch. The music file already has all the Pythagorean values in its 
active Expression Library (this note is programmed to use a pitch bend value of 
8672, as indicated in the list of figures in [17] above. <b>Figure 4</b> 
shows the initial window provided by Finale 3.7.2. This window appeared 
because the Staff Expression icon in the left box was selected, and the first 
note in the score was clicked. In this Selection window, the Staff Expression 
&ldquo;A&rdquo; has now been selected. To discover what its current settings are (and even 
to edit them) the &ldquo;Edit<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo; button will now be clicked. This now opens the Text 
Expression Designer window where it can be seen that the current setting is &ldquo;Pitchwheel&rdquo; 
set to &ldquo;8672.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> This 
is shown in <b>Figure 5</b>. Since this is correct, the various windows are now 
closed by clicking on the appropriate &ldquo;OK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Select&rdquo; buttons, and the letter 
&ldquo;A&rdquo; now appears above the note in the score. When played back the pitch will be 
Pythagorean A. </p>

[23] Below are two downloadable Finale files (Example 1 and Example 2).  
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Example 1: Josquin Desprez, <i>Ave Maria</i> (excerpt using equal

  [<a href="Ex1.MUS.sit">Ex1.MUS.sit</a> (for Mac users)]<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
The 
first is a straight file for playback using four separate channels, and the same 
patch number for each. You are advised to avoid using any &ldquo;piano&rdquo; sound because 
our ears are conditioned to assuming that anything sounding like a piano uses 
Equal Temperament. This might give the illusion that the piece is &ldquo;out of tune&rdquo; 
when it really is not. Select a melody instrument for playback through channels 
1, 2, 3 and 4 (a Recorder sound is ideal). The file will not change your 
keyboard patch settings. This should give a normal playback using equal 
temperament. The second is an edited version of the first, but now attaches to 
each note its Pythagorean playback values. The correct Expression library 
(detailed above) is embedded within the file, so it should simply play the music 
correctly. But the following checklist should first be made before trying it: 
</p>
<p>
CHECKLIST </p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Have you reset your Pitchbend Range to a value of &ldquo;1&rdquo; on the 
keyboard? Test the bender manually to ensure that it inflects upwards and 
downwards by only a <i>semitone</i> for patches you will set for channels 1-4 (the 
setting used for Examples 1 and 2). If this has not been done, you will quickly 
find that comedy becomes tragedy! This setting must of course be applied to each 
and every patch you intend to use for playback. </li>
  <li>Before playing the file, open 
the Instrument List window to ensure that your download has retained separate 
channels for each staff. If not, you will have to assign these staves to 
different channels using this window. You can, however, use the same patch 
number for each channel (having, as in a) above, verified the pitch bend setting 
as being &ldquo;1&rdquo;). Make sure that the &ldquo;Send Patches before Play<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo; box is 
  checked.</li>
</ol>
<h3>
SYNTONIC TUNING </h3>
<p>
[24] As stated earlier, Syntonic tuning is 
only an inflection of the Pythagorean scale in which Syntonic comma adjustment 
is applied to particular notes of the tetrachords. Potentially <i>any</i> note of the 
scale can be adjusted upwards or downwards by a comma depending upon its 
tetrachordal location and context. For this reason, each note of the Pythagorean 
scale needs to be provided with complementary values reflecting upward and 
downward comma adjustment. Indeed this adjustment can sometimes be greater than 
a single comma over the course of a whole piece, so what needs to be provided 
for is two or three complementary values for each note sharpwards and flatwards. 
Where an unavoidable accumulation of commas causes a composition to undergo an 
audibly significant <i>and irreversible</i> rise or fall in base pitch, the 
assumption should be that Syntonic tuning is the wrong soundscape for that piece 
and that Pythagorean tuning was intended by the composer. It is still advisable, 
however, to provide for a certain number of comma shifts either way, if only to 
test the effect of Syntonic tuning in such cases and adjudge the impact of the 
pitch change. </p>
<p>
[25] The Syntonic comma is a fixed though non-melodic interval 
whose ratio is 81:80.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> As such it always gives the same quantifiable 
inflection when applied to an existing pitch. Whether the inflection is 
sharpwards or flatwards in no way changes its definition as a quantity. In order 
to calculate a pitchwheel value for the interval it must first be converted into 
Cents, and then multiplied by 81.92 (the pitchwheel value for each Cent). 
Conversion into Cents is via the normal formula for converting from an interval 
ratio (i): </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>LOG(i) * (1200/LOG(2)). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Pitchwheel value now requires this to be 
multiplied by 81.92, and the result is simultaneously added to or subtracted 
from the pitchwheel value of an already existing note. If, therefore, the 
pitchwheel value of &ldquo;C minus a Syntonic comma&rdquo; is computed, the formula 
(starting from 8192 for the C) will be: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>8192-(LOG(81/80) * (1200/LOG(2)) * 81.92 
= 6430 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The result of 6430 will therefore be set for pitches where C is to be 
lowered by a Syntonic comma. Were it to be raised by a Syntonic comma, the first 
operand would be changed to a &ldquo;+&rdquo;: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>8192+(LOG(81/80) * (1200/LOG(2)) * 81.92 = 
9954. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This new value of 9954 will consequently be set for notes where C is 
raised by a Syntonic comma.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[26] Charts plotting all the pitchwheel 
values of the Pythagorean scale, together with comma shifts upwards and 
downwards, are most easily achieved by using a spreadsheet. <b>Figures 11</b> and <b>
12</b> show complete charts (Figure 11 for older versions, and Figure 12 for 
later) plotting up to four comma shifts upwards and downwards. It is unlikely 
that this number will be needed, let alone ever exceeded, although it can be 
extended if desired. The default value for C (8192 [0]) is the only simple 
numeric entry contained in these spreadsheets. Every other value has been 
automatically computed and generated by the insertion of formulae. What will be 
noted is that all the values in Figure 12 are less&mdash;by a value of 8192&mdash;than the 
corresponding values in Figure 11. In these the default Pythagorean pitchwheel value 
of each note is shown in column 2, and the remaining columns list the settings 
for the comma shifts as indicated at the head of each column. These are the 
values that need to be programmed into the new Expression library either from 
Figure 11 or Figure 12 as appropriate. </p>
<p>
[27] In creating a complete library of 
Staff Expressions to give accurate playback, as outlined above, the name tags 
need to be simple and clear in order to indicate the exact inflections of each 
note. For this purpose, the library encoded in Example 2 above contained all the 
Pythagorean pitches and these are identified simply by the letter name of the 
note concerned. Where there is a flat this is indicated by the &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffix (e.g. 
Bb), but sharps are shown by the use of the suffix &ldquo;$&rdquo; (e.g. F$) for the reason 
stated in note 18 above. When this simple library is expanded so as to include 
all the upward and downward Syntonic comma inflections for every note, the tags 
need to indicate the base notes as well as the exact inflections. The simplest 
method of displaying these attributes is to use the letter name of the note, an 
operand indicating upward or downward inflection (&ldquo;+&rdquo; or &ldquo;-&rdquo;) and a numeral 
showing the number of comma values by which the note has been inflected. Thus 
the tag &ldquo;C-1&rdquo; will indicate C lowered by a comma, &ldquo;F$+2&rdquo; the note F-sharp raised 
by two commas, and &ldquo;Bb+1&rdquo; the note B-flat raised by one comma.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[28] Example 3 below is a downloadable 
Finale file containing the complete active library of pitches displayed above in 
Figure 11.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>

The score it displays has already been edited by the insertion of 
appropriate Staff Expressions in which is encoded the exact pitchwheel values 
for playback. If you are sure that your keyboard is set to the appropriate Pitch 
Bend value, and you have verified that the bend is only a semitone upwards and 
downwards when the pitchwheel is activated, you can play the file back and it 
should be finely tuned to work in Just Intonation (for which soundscape it was 
clearly designed and carefully controlled by the composer). Before playing it, 
make sure that you have allotted appropriate patches to channels 1-4, and that 
each patch to be used has a pitch bend setting (on the keyboard) of &ldquo;1.&rdquo; In 
order to apply this library to other scores of your own, you should use the 
&ldquo;Save Library<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo; command, select the radio button for &ldquo;Text Expressions,&rdquo; and 
give it a recognizable name (e.g. &ldquo;Syntonic&rdquo;). Once Saved, this library can then 
be Opened from within any other file created and it will be immediately active. 
If you intend to use it frequently for new scores, you could even create a 
template to save time importing the file every time you need it. </p>

[29] This 
essay has not primarily been offered in order to increase an interest in or 
awareness of technology, though hopefully those readers who use technology will 
have benefited from it in some way. The <i>real</i> purpose has rather been to 
demonstrate that not only is it possible to know that the pitches being created 
are indeed those understood and used by early musicians, but also that in 
hearing them with this certain knowledge we can extend our cognitive experience 
and thereby achieve a much better understanding of the soundscapes that for too 
long have remained obscure. Pitch, however, is only one part (even though an 
important one) of this soundscape. Furthermore an understanding of the ways in 
which these pitches can be recreated through simple technology does not in 
itself provide the <i>musical</i> understanding necessary to know where and how to 
apply the pitches that can be generated. Only by the development of a meticulous 
and clinical approach to comma analysis can the perceptions this yields be 
realized through the technology that has been created. </p>
<h3>
POSTSCRIPT: Guillaume 
Costeley: <i>Seigneur dieu ta piti&eacute;</i> </h3>
<p>
[30] This short postscript will offer a 
curiosity that demonstrates again Finale&rsquo;s power to provide superfine tunings. 
While many readers will be familiar with Guillaume Costeley&rsquo;s spiritual chanson
<i>Seigneur dieu ta piti&eacute;</i>, very few will ever have heard it rendered, as the 
composer prescribed in his Preface to the 1570 print, in 19-tone equal 
temperament (19-tet). He there described the use of a keyboard upon which seven 
extra black keys were to be added.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
The normal black keys were supplemented by a further seven, one lying alongside 
each existing one, and an extra one being added between B and C, and between E 
and F. In this system B-sharp was the same keyboard note as C-flat, and E-sharp 
the same as F-flat. This resulted in nineteen separate notes to each octave, and 
Costeley prescribed that the interval between each successive note should be 
one-third of a tone. Diatonic semitones are to be given the interval value of 
two-thirds of a tone. </p>
<p>
[31] It is clear from 
this description that tones are smaller than standard.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> It must also be the 
case that minor thirds (equaling five thirds of a tone) are larger than the 
Pythagorean minor thirds, and that major thirds (equaling four thirds of a 
tone) must be smaller than the Pythagorean ones. Thirds and sixths will 
therefore be nearer to the JI intervals, while the fourths and fifths will be 
slightly dissonant.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[32] The programming of a playback for 19-tet is 
very easy in Finale, since only twenty-one different values have to be provided 
for (which is only three more than the Pythagorean scale required).<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> Since 
the octave (1200 Cents) divides into nineteen portions, each one-third step must 
be equal to 63.15789 Cents. When this scale is allotted Pitchwheel setting, the 
following values will be found to be correct (again values for the later 
versions of Finale appearing in square brackets): </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>C: 8192 [0] <br>
  C-sharp: 5174 
[-3018] <br>
  D-flat 10348 [2156] <br>
  D: 7330 [-862] <br>
  D-sharp: 4312 [-3880] <br>
  E-flat: 9485 
[1293] <br>
  E: 6467 [-1725] <br>
  E-sharp: 3449 [-4743] <br>
  F-flat: 11641 [3449] <br>
  F: 8623 [431] 
<br>
  F-sharp: 5605 [-2587] <br>
  G-flat: 10779 [2587] <br>
  G: 7761 [-431] <br>
  G-sharp: 4743 [-3449] 
<br>
  A-flat: 9917 [1725] <br>
  A: 6898 [-1294] <br>
  A-sharp: 3880 [-4312] <br>
  B-flat: 9054 [862] <br>
  B: 
6036 [-2156] <br>
  B-sharp: 3018 [-5174] <br>
  C-flat: 11210 [3018] </p>

	<p><a name="FN1">1.</a> Of the many available music notation programs, my 
preference for Finale here is only because it is particularly well suited to 
combining visual analysis with superfine pitch control. But its method is 
unique, and files converted into, say, Sibelius will not retain the MIDI 
settings that have been applied. Although Finale has been upgraded regularly, 
most of the changes have been designed only to enhance user friendliness and to 
present better looking windows and scores. The window dressing aside, the 
functionality of the program has remained fairly stable. But in the specific 
area to be discussed below later versions of Finale have adopted a slightly 
different (and perhaps more logical) method of data management. This will be 
explained in due course.<br><a href="#FN1REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN2">2.</a> Readers might like to know that the writer does not 
regard himself as a technological boffin, and they might perhaps be comforted 
(or irritated if they expect boffin-style discourse) by the assurance that 
explanations will be simple and comprehensible.<br><a href="#FN2REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN3">3.</a> If your keyboard provides other preset temperaments such 
as &ldquo;Pythagorean&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; you should make sure that it is only set to equal 
temperament. All the settings that will be provided in this essay take the 
equally-tempered keyboard as the default. None of the music to be generated will 
actually use equal temperament of course, but the pitchwheel settings presume 
this as being the default.<br><a href="#FN3REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN4">4.</a> You can verify this quite simply. Assuming your MIDI 
keyboard is set up to generate sounds through your speakers, hold down any note 
and move the pitchwheel fully to the right and then the left. The pitch of the 
note should rise and fall by a full octave. If it is different this does not 
matter, and it merely indicates that the default setting has been changed. The 
setting will again be changed later to another value in any case.<br><a href="#FN4REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN5">5.</a> As will be shown, early versions of Finale provided both 
Staff Expression and Score Expression tools, while later versions offer only a 
common and single Expression Tool. In these later versions, setting of the 
required entry for either &ldquo;Staff&rdquo; or &ldquo;Score&rdquo; is made via various sub menus. The 
functionality of whatever entry is made remains identical however. A less useful 
method of pitch control is to open the Midi Tool and edit the pitchbend values 
of notes that are to be changed. This is far less accurate and anything that is 
done remains invisible except to the inner workings of the program. The more 
accurate method outlined here remains visible in the score, and can easily be 
edited or changed.<br><a href="#FN5REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN6">6.</a> If the score is empty, perhaps because the file is newly 
created, simply insert a note. Then select the Staff Expression tool icon and 
click on the note.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> Now that the procedure for editing and inserting 
pitchwheel values has been followed, the various &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; buttons can be clicked 
to close down the Staff Expression tool so as to avoid changing the note 
originally selected. In order to rehearse the procedure again, the instructions 
given in [6] above can be repeated.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> These are the new values that Finale automatically 
converts to when a file created in what it recognizes as an &ldquo;older version&rdquo; is 
loaded into the later version. In such a file, later versions will convert 
original pitchwheel values of 8192 to 0, 0 to -8192, and 16384 to (+)8192. All 
resulting values in the later versions will therefore be equivalent to all those 
in the early version <i>minus 8192</i>.<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN9">9.</a> It is, however, much better than what is provided by the 
MIDI tool which only splits the same pitchbend interval into 64 equal parts. 
This is wholly inadequate for pitches of the accuracy required.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> The keyboard User Manual will give the information 
needed for altering the bend value. On my Roland the bender range can be 
accessed via the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and then the &ldquo;Lower&rdquo; buttons, and found by scrolling 
through the list with the &ldquo;Display&rdquo; button. When &ldquo;Bender Range&rdquo; is displayed, 
its value can be set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Value&rdquo; button and the new setting saved 
using the &ldquo;Write&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; buttons. Other keyboards will have equivalent 
methods of making changes to these settings.<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> The Bend Range value increments by semitones so that 
the default value of &ldquo;12&rdquo; yields a pitch bend of a full octave up and down. By 
changing this setting to &ldquo;1&rdquo; the bend range will be reduced to only a semitone 
up or down.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> Keyboards always adopted &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; tunings although 
some experiments with split keys were designed to increase the number of pitches 
available for each octave. This facilitated a differentiation between sharps and 
flats so as to enable the consistent use of pure thirds on all degrees. 
Unaccompanied vocal performance, however, did not need to compromise and comma 
inflection was a normal part of a singer&rsquo;s technique. This might require the 
same note to vary in pitch (according to context) from its normal Pythagorean 
position to a comma higher or lower. Frequently, but under tight compositional 
control, this might be extended at times up to two commas higher or lower than 
Pythagorean pitch. But such flexibility was completely out of the range of 
normal keyboards whose tuning (in whatever compromise system was adopted) had to 
remain entirely fixed for a particular performance.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> I should again stress that files created with older 
versions are updated automatically when opened by later versions of Finale, but 
when creating <i>new</i> 
files in <i>any</i> version the user will need to know which set of values to 
apply. If the list provided below for &ldquo;older versions&rdquo; is mistakenly used in 
&ldquo;later versions,&rdquo; Finale&mdash;in blissful ignorance&mdash;will produce extremely bizarre 
results.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> As stated in [11] above, &ldquo;8192&rdquo; here refers to the 
default numeric value for &ldquo;older versions&rdquo; and the following &ldquo;[0]&rdquo; that for 
&ldquo;later.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> It must be remembered that the Pythagorean scale is 
the default scale for Just Intonation, and that the tuning of JI arises from the 
addition/subtraction of the Syntonic comma (81:80) to/ from notes that are 
modified for consonance purposes. The effect of this modification is to change 
all the Pythagorean diatonic semitones from minor (256:243) to major (16:15), to 
narrow all the major thirds and sixths, and to widen all the minor thirds and 
sixths. But these changes all result from the single application each time of a 
Syntonic comma adjustment (upwards or downwards) that changes the default 
Pythagorean pitches concerned.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> Theorists who explain the Pythagorean scale do so in 
terms of sounding length, and this leads to sounding length ratios. Thus, for 
example, the pure fifth is 3:2, and the octave is 2:1. Although the same ratios 
are inversely correct for the relative quantities defining the two pitches 
involved, they do not define the pitches themselves (but only the relative 
values between them). What is needed here is an unambiguous definition of the <i>actual pitch</i> 
to be generated for each note defined. This can only be achieved by converting 
the ratio values into Cents and then calculating the pitch of each note in terms 
of the number of Cents that make it higher or lower than the default note from 
which it is computed.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> This value for &ldquo;G&rdquo; will be the same for every &ldquo;G&rdquo; in 
every octave, and all other respective values obtained for all other notes will 
be the same for all octaves.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> Again the numeric value for later versions is less 
than for older ones by a total of 8192. This, like all other pitchwheel values, 
is calculated to the nearest 1 in 8192 parts of a semitone. Equally-tempered 
fifths have been narrowed from their Pythagorean defaults. Since the pitchwheel 
value of C is 8192 [0], the restoration of the G to its Pythagorean position 
will necessarily increase its pitchwheel value. The new value of 8352 [160] has 
raised the pitch by a pitchwheel value of 160. When this is divided by 81.92 
(the pitchwheel value for each Cent as shown in [14] above), the difference is 
found to be 1.953125 Cents<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> If, for example, you indicated F-sharp with the tag 
&ldquo;F#,&rdquo; Finale would show &ldquo;9152&rdquo; because it would assume that you had asked for 
the numeric value assigned to be displayed in place of the tag itself.<br><a href="#FN19REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN20">20.</a> Experienced Finale users will know that the process of 
inserting Text Expressions can be simplified and speeded up by the use of 
metatools. Since most pieces using Pythagorean tuning only have a range of up to 
nine different pitch classes in each octave, assigning each global pitch to a 
metatool makes insertion very quick and easy. Other users will simply have to 
make a separate insertion (via the Staff Expression window) for each and every 
note in the score.<br><a href="#FN20REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN21">21.</a> In the Instrument List window it will be necessary to 
assign a different instrument for each staff, and then a different channel. In 
the &ldquo;Prog.&rdquo; column the same sound patch can be selected if wished.<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> This number can, of course, be changed to whatever 
value you like dependent upon the pitch needed relative to any tuning 
requirement or system you wish to use. It will be set for the entire piece, 
however, and the current value is the one needed for its Pythagorean pitch.<br><a href="#FN22REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN23">23.</a> The figure &ldquo;480&rdquo; indicates the same pitch inflection 
within the 0-8192 numeric range (used by later versions) as does the figure 
&ldquo;8672&rdquo; within the numeric range 8192-16384 (used by older versions), 
representing simply an increase in pitch bend of 480 units.<br><a href="#FN23REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN24">24.</a> It is &ldquo;non-melodic&rdquo; since it was considered too small 
to form a discrete interval in its own right. But when it was added to or 
subtracted from a larger interval the overall result did yield a new melodic 
interval. When added to a Pythagorean minor semitone, the result was a major 
semitone (16:15) which was a distinct interval capable of being leant and 
performed. Also when it was subtracted from a Pythagorean tone (9:8) the result 
was the minor tone (10:9) which again was a discrete interval to be learnt and 
sung. The addition or subtraction of this quantity is what gives rise to the new 
intervals whose cognition and accurate delivery lies at the heart of the skills

it stands to reason that the presence of such vibrato will sabotage any attempt 
to enter the true sound world of Syntonic tuning. On some keyboards, even the 
&ldquo;harpsichord&rdquo; patch is infected by vibrato. Removing it is straightforward, but

complex to be discussed here and will form the substance of a future article. 
But his description of the keyboard upon which he stipulated the chanson could 
be successfully performed, while remaining in tune throughout, shows it to have 
been similar to the one discussed by other musicians of the time (notably 
Vicentino).<br><a href="#FN28REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN29">29.</a> The tones must be smaller because if the octave equals 
nineteen intervals of one-third of a tone each there must be at least six and 
one-third tones in each octave. The Pythagorean octave contains only five tones 
plus two minor semitones (which is less than six overall). The keyboard tones 
described by Costeley must therefore be minor tones roughly equivalent to the 
Syntonic (10:9) minor tones. In compensation for this, the diatonic semitones 
are large (two-thirds the size of a tone in fact), and these, too, must 
correspond roughly with the Syntonic diatonic semitones (16:15) although they 
are marginally larger in size. The occasional use of non-diatonic semitones 
(used either melodically or arising from close cross relations) provides, 
according to Costeley&rsquo;s assessment, movement equaling only one-third of a tone.<br><a href="#FN29REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN30">30.</a> In this temperament, the interval of a fifth is 
perceptibly narrowed (much more so indeed than in 12-tone equal temperament), 
and the fourths are correspondingly widened by a no less perceptible amount. The 
overall effect of this temperament is radically different from that of 12-tone 
equal temperament. In the latter, the effect (as we are used to) is one of 
tolerably pure fourths and fifths together with pure octaves, upon which have 
been superimposed distinctly out-of-tune thirds and sixths (to which our ears 
have now become accustomed). In the former, however, the soundscape is one in 
which the fourths and fifths are sufficiently out of phase to produce a wavy 
timbre (similar to a gentle <i>voix celeste</i> organ sound), upon which has now 
been superimposed strikingly pure thirds and sixths.<br><a href="#FN30REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN31">31.</a> There will need to be twenty-one separate values 
because the B-sharp/C-flat and E-sharp/F-flat pairs will each need different 
values for both notes (even though whichever is used will provide the same 
actual pitch). Sometimes Finale will have to read F-flat, and sometimes E-sharp: 
the first (= E in 12-tet) will have to be raised from its default pitch while 
the second (= F in 12-tet) will need to be lowered. Whichever is used in the 
version edited for keyboard will depend solely upon its diatonic context: if 
G-flat descends by a diatonic semitone (= two-thirds of a tone) the following 
pitch will be written as F-flat; but if a D-sharp rises by a diatonic semitone 
the following note will appear as E-sharp. Finale therefore needs to have both 
members of each pair provided for.<br><a href="#FN31REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN32">32.</a> The appearance of the score will sometimes look 
strange, and somehow &ldquo;between the cracks,&rdquo; to those thinking in 12-tone equal 
temperament. Frequently chords appear as though they need re-enharmonizing. In 
reality, however, each note is completely pitch-specific and relates to a 
particular key on the keyboard. Only the single black notes dividing the B/C and 
E/F pairs have alternative means of notation.<br><a href="#FN32REF">Return to text</a></p><div id="fndiv1" class="flyoverdiv">Of the many available music notation programs, my 
preference for Finale here is only because it is particularly well suited to 
combining visual analysis with superfine pitch control. But its method is 
unique, and files converted into, say, Sibelius will not retain the MIDI 
settings that have been applied. Although Finale has been upgraded regularly, 
most of the changes have been designed only to enhance user friendliness and to 
present better looking windows and scores. The window dressing aside, the 
functionality of the program has remained fairly stable. But in the specific 
area to be discussed below later versions of Finale have adopted a slightly 
different (and perhaps more logical) method of data management. This will be 
explained in due course.</div><div id="fndiv2" class="flyoverdiv">Readers might like to know that the writer does not 
regard himself as a technological boffin, and they might perhaps be comforted 
(or irritated if they expect boffin-style discourse) by the assurance that 
explanations will be simple and comprehensible.</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">If your keyboard provides other preset temperaments such 
as &ldquo;Pythagorean&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just,&rdquo; you should make sure that it is only set to equal 
temperament. All the settings that will be provided in this essay take the 
equally-tempered keyboard as the default. None of the music to be generated will 
actually use equal temperament of course, but the pitchwheel settings presume 
this as being the default.</div><div id="fndiv4" class="flyoverdiv">You can verify this quite simply. Assuming your MIDI 
keyboard is set up to generate sounds through your speakers, hold down any note 
and move the pitchwheel fully to the right and then the left. The pitch of the 
note should rise and fall by a full octave. If it is different this does not 
matter, and it merely indicates that the default setting has been changed. The 
setting will again be changed later to another value in any case.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">As will be shown, early versions of Finale provided both 
Staff Expression and Score Expression tools, while later versions offer only a 
common and single Expression Tool. In these later versions, setting of the 
required entry for either &ldquo;Staff&rdquo; or &ldquo;Score&rdquo; is made via various sub menus. The 
functionality of whatever entry is made remains identical however. A less useful 
method of pitch control is to open the Midi Tool and edit the pitchbend values 
of notes that are to be changed. This is far less accurate and anything that is 
done remains invisible except to the inner workings of the program. The more 
accurate method outlined here remains visible in the score, and can easily be 
edited or changed.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">If the score is empty, perhaps because the file is newly 
created, simply insert a note. Then select the Staff Expression tool icon and 
click on the note.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Now that the procedure for editing and inserting 
pitchwheel values has been followed, the various &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; buttons can be clicked 
to close down the Staff Expression tool so as to avoid changing the note 
originally selected. In order to rehearse the procedure again, the instructions 
given in [6] above can be repeated.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">These are the new values that Finale automatically 
converts to when a file created in what it recognizes as an &ldquo;older version&rdquo; is 
loaded into the later version. In such a file, later versions will convert 
original pitchwheel values of 8192 to 0, 0 to -8192, and 16384 to (+)8192. All 
resulting values in the later versions will therefore be equivalent to all those 
in the early version <i>minus 8192</i>.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">It is, however, much better than what is provided by the 
MIDI tool which only splits the same pitchbend interval into 64 equal parts. 
This is wholly inadequate for pitches of the accuracy required.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">The keyboard User Manual will give the information 
needed for altering the bend value. On my Roland the bender range can be 
accessed via the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and then the &ldquo;Lower&rdquo; buttons, and found by scrolling 
through the list with the &ldquo;Display&rdquo; button. When &ldquo;Bender Range&rdquo; is displayed, 
its value can be set to &ldquo;1&rdquo; with the &ldquo;Value&rdquo; button and the new setting saved 
using the &ldquo;Write&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enter&rdquo; buttons. Other keyboards will have equivalent 
methods of making changes to these settings.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">The Bend Range value increments by semitones so that 
the default value of &ldquo;12&rdquo; yields a pitch bend of a full octave up and down. By 
changing this setting to &ldquo;1&rdquo; the bend range will be reduced to only a semitone 
up or down.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Keyboards always adopted &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; tunings although 
some experiments with split keys were designed to increase the number of pitches 
available for each octave. This facilitated a differentiation between sharps and 
flats so as to enable the consistent use of pure thirds on all degrees. 
Unaccompanied vocal performance, however, did not need to compromise and comma 
inflection was a normal part of a singer&rsquo;s technique. This might require the 
same note to vary in pitch (according to context) from its normal Pythagorean 
position to a comma higher or lower. Frequently, but under tight compositional 
control, this might be extended at times up to two commas higher or lower than 
Pythagorean pitch. But such flexibility was completely out of the range of 
normal keyboards whose tuning (in whatever compromise system was adopted) had to 
remain entirely fixed for a particular performance.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">I should again stress that files created with older 
versions are updated automatically when opened by later versions of Finale, but 
when creating <i>new</i> 
files in <i>any</i> version the user will need to know which set of values to 
apply. If the list provided below for &ldquo;older versions&rdquo; is mistakenly used in 
&ldquo;later versions,&rdquo; Finale&mdash;in blissful ignorance&mdash;will produce extremely bizarre 
results.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">As stated in [11] above, &ldquo;8192&rdquo; here refers to the 
default numeric value for &ldquo;older versions&rdquo; and the following &ldquo;[0]&rdquo; that for 
&ldquo;later.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">It must be remembered that the Pythagorean scale is 
the default scale for Just Intonation, and that the tuning of JI arises from the 
addition/subtraction of the Syntonic comma (81:80) to/ from notes that are 
modified for consonance purposes. The effect of this modification is to change 
all the Pythagorean diatonic semitones from minor (256:243) to major (16:15), to 
narrow all the major thirds and sixths, and to widen all the minor thirds and 
sixths. But these changes all result from the single application each time of a 
Syntonic comma adjustment (upwards or downwards) that changes the default 
Pythagorean pitches concerned.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Theorists who explain the Pythagorean scale do so in 
terms of sounding length, and this leads to sounding length ratios. Thus, for 
example, the pure fifth is 3:2, and the octave is 2:1. Although the same ratios 
are inversely correct for the relative quantities defining the two pitches 
involved, they do not define the pitches themselves (but only the relative 
values between them). What is needed here is an unambiguous definition of the <i>actual pitch</i> 
to be generated for each note defined. This can only be achieved by converting 
the ratio values into Cents and then calculating the pitch of each note in terms 
of the number of Cents that make it higher or lower than the default note from 
which it is computed.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">This value for &ldquo;G&rdquo; will be the same for every &ldquo;G&rdquo; in 
every octave, and all other respective values obtained for all other notes will 
be the same for all octaves.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Again the numeric value for later versions is less 
than for older ones by a total of 8192. This, like all other pitchwheel values, 
is calculated to the nearest 1 in 8192 parts of a semitone. Equally-tempered 
fifths have been narrowed from their Pythagorean defaults. Since the pitchwheel 
value of C is 8192 [0], the restoration of the G to its Pythagorean position 
will necessarily increase its pitchwheel value. The new value of 8352 [160] has 
raised the pitch by a pitchwheel value of 160. When this is divided by 81.92 
(the pitchwheel value for each Cent as shown in [14] above), the difference is 
found to be 1.953125 Cents</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">If, for example, you indicated F-sharp with the tag 
&ldquo;F#,&rdquo; Finale would show &ldquo;9152&rdquo; because it would assume that you had asked for 
the numeric value assigned to be displayed in place of the tag itself.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">Experienced Finale users will know that the process of 
inserting Text Expressions can be simplified and speeded up by the use of 
metatools. Since most pieces using Pythagorean tuning only have a range of up to 
nine different pitch classes in each octave, assigning each global pitch to a 
metatool makes insertion very quick and easy. Other users will simply have to 
make a separate insertion (via the Staff Expression window) for each and every 
note in the score.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">In the Instrument List window it will be necessary to 
assign a different instrument for each staff, and then a different channel. In 
the &ldquo;Prog.&rdquo; column the same sound patch can be selected if wished.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">This number can, of course, be changed to whatever 
value you like dependent upon the pitch needed relative to any tuning 
requirement or system you wish to use. It will be set for the entire piece, 
however, and the current value is the one needed for its Pythagorean pitch.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">The figure &ldquo;480&rdquo; indicates the same pitch inflection 
within the 0-8192 numeric range (used by later versions) as does the figure 
&ldquo;8672&rdquo; within the numeric range 8192-16384 (used by older versions), 
representing simply an increase in pitch bend of 480 units.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">It is &ldquo;non-melodic&rdquo; since it was considered too small 
to form a discrete interval in its own right. But when it was added to or 
subtracted from a larger interval the overall result did yield a new melodic 
interval. When added to a Pythagorean minor semitone, the result was a major 
semitone (16:15) which was a distinct interval capable of being leant and 
performed. Also when it was subtracted from a Pythagorean tone (9:8) the result 
was the minor tone (10:9) which again was a discrete interval to be learnt and 
sung. The addition or subtraction of this quantity is what gives rise to the new 
intervals whose cognition and accurate delivery lies at the heart of the skills 
required for the accurate performance of Just Intonation.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">Both these calculations are, of course, for the older 
versions of Finale. For the newer versions (which will upgrade existing 
old-version files automatically) the figure &ldquo;8192&rdquo; will be replaced with &ldquo;0,&rdquo; 
and the results of the above calculations will be respectively &ldquo;-1762&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;1762.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">In order to produce a clean and pure Syntonic 
intonation, you are strongly advised to eliminate completely any default vibrato 
that will undoubtedly be set on your MIDI keyboard. Since even the most gentle 
vibrato is unlikely to create pitch fluctuation of less than a Syntonic comma, 
it stands to reason that the presence of such vibrato will sabotage any attempt 
to enter the true sound world of Syntonic tuning. On some keyboards, even the 
&ldquo;harpsichord&rdquo; patch is infected by vibrato. Removing it is straightforward, but 
reference should again be made to the User Manual or technical assistance
