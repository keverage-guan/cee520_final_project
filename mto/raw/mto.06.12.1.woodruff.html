<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p><h4>I. Introduction</h4>
<p>[1.1] Stravinsky embodied in <i>The Rite of Spring</i> an aesthetic experience so 
profound that it continues to stir us today. In listening to <i>The Rite</i> our 
attention is drawn to certain combinations of chords, melodies, and movements, 
which are satisfying in themselves, reshaping traditions of the past, infusing 
old forms with new spirit. Yet it is hard for us to empathize with the audience 
who attended <i>The Rite&rsquo;s</i> premiere. In 1913, there was little in the concert 
repertoire to soften its impact, to prepare the audience. Without the prior 
knowledge or experience necessary to give such music meaning, how could it have 
been understood? It is different for us today for we have the advantage of 
almost a hundred years experience from which to draw when contemplating <i>The 
Rite</i>. It is from here that we gain admission into its sound world and begin to 
understand the combinations which make this work unique.</p>
<p>[1.2] We can also see where earlier attempts to come to grips with Stravinsky&rsquo;s 
music might have gone astray. Without recourse to this fund of experience, 
theorists seeking to explain or justify the music inevitably turned toward 
models of the past to guide them. In the realm of rhythm and meter, this meant a 
periodic model of meter: a single, steady meter as manifest in the music of the 
tonal tradition. They were right in attributing periodicity to this model, for 
periodicity is an intrinsic quality of meter, but wrong in confining meter to a 
<i>single</i> course of projection.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> This assumption forced Stravinsky&rsquo;s metric 
invention, full of unexpected twists, into a mould which didn&rsquo;t quite fit. As a 
result, these twists, or irregularities, were interpreted as deviations from the 
periodic model, a model whose one-dimensional implications were taken for 
granted. This view has persisted, and where old forms are used to interpret new 
expressions, aesthetic appreciation is apt to be misled.</p>
<p>[1.3] However, in recent research models have emerged in which meter is no 
longer bound to a single course. In &ldquo;A Theory of Musical Meter&rdquo; William Benjamin 
proposes that the phenomenon known as elision is counted on two overlapping 
meters of the same time signature.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Pieter van den Toorn suggests moreover 
that we hear the foreground irregularities of Stravinsky&rsquo;s music in the context 
of a steady background meter.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Both authors reconcile cherished notions of 
periodicity with irregularity by extending meter beyond the confines of a single 
course. This is fitting, and it is to this cause that the current article is 
dedicated. The task at hand is to present a model of meter which takes into 
account the potential phases inherent within meter, and to explore a specific 
kind of metric interaction implicit in this system &mdash; phase shift. This model is 
based on the work of John Roeder, who uses pulse streams to illustrate 
concurrent meters in the works of Schoenberg and Bartok.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The phase-shift 
model is applied to a number of episodes from <i>The Rite of Spring</i> in which 
meter and the musical substance in general are governed by a <i>determinant 
motive</i>&mdash;any musical event central to metric projection. Metric irregularities 
often arise by way of the displacement of a determinant motive, either by 
varying the period at which it is repeated, or by altering some aspect of its 
configuration. But first we step back to look at some of the ideas which 
contribute to the fund from which we draw. </p>
<h4>II. Background</h4>
<p>[2.1] An issue that has long interested theorists is that of hypermetric 
irregularity, irregularity caused by uneven phrase lengths.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> While most tonal 
works are periodic at the level of the measure, it is not unusual for such works 
to break periodicity at the level of the hypermeasure. In attempting to 
reconcile these breaks with periodicity, theorists have described several 
processes: two which have figured in the discussion of Stravinsky&rsquo;s music, 
extension and elision, are briefly considered here. An extension occurs when a 
hypermeasure exceeds its expected length, the expectation of which is 
established in the preceding measures.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
Thus a cycle of four-bar phrases interrupted by a five-bar phrase forms a 
hypermetric irregularity by means of extension. The converse process, 
contraction, occurs when a hypermeasure is shorter than its expected length. The 
conclusion drawn is that the extension or contraction of a musical event 
triggers a corresponding alteration to the meter, effectively adding or deleting 
a beat from an otherwise steady meter. This is illustrated by enumerating the 
metric identities yielded by an extension: 1-2-3-4 1-2-3-4-5 1-2-3-4. Metric 
identity here denotes a number corresponding to the beat projected by an event, 
the succession of which reveals a pattern of such identities.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.2] The problem with extension is that it is not, strictly speaking, metric. 
Adding or deleting beats from an otherwise steady meter compromises periodicity, 
an intrinsic quality of meter. This cut and paste process is more suitably 
applied to pitch phenomena, phrases, chords, melodies, and the like, whose 
extension may trigger an irregularity, but it does not follow that meter has 
been extended in the same way. What is altered, however, is the pattern of 
metric identity. Confusion arises when theorists, assuming a single meter is in 
force, read this pattern as the entire meter. The result is a perception of 
meter as a single, albeit varying course of projection. It can be tempting to 
view beats as extended or contracted, as long as we acknowledge that they are a 
surface projection of meter, an effect, rather than the source. Whether dealing 
with background hypermetric irregularities of tonal music or the more immediate 
foreground irregularities of twentieth-century music, extension is of little 
consequence in reconciling periodicity with irregularity. </p>

                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Elision</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[2.3] The second process, elision, involves two phrases which overlap so that 
the final measure of the first phrase is also the opening measure of the second 
phrase. The point of overlap between the two phrases has a dual metric identity. 
The upbeat of the first phrase, count 4, is also the downbeat of the second 
phrase, count 1, and is interpreted as both simultaneously. In order to 
reconcile the overlap with periodic meter, Benjamin put forward a model in which 
the two phrases are counted separately on two meters of the same hypermetric 
time signature (see 
<b>Example 1</b>).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
The first phrase is counted in full from 1 to 4, as is the second, only the 
second phrase is counted alongside or parallel to the first phrase at the point 
of overlap. Described by Benjamin as &lsquo;a transformation of a (strictly) metric 
structure&rsquo;, it preserves the periodic model, but increases the number of meters 
used to accommodate the irregularity.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<h4>III. Foreground Irregularities</h4>
<p>[3.1] Conceptually the tools of extension and elision can be used to interpret 
foreground irregularities&mdash;those compelling metric disruptions in modern music 
which occur at the more immediate level of the beat and measure.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
This would 
correspond to the commonly held view in which &lsquo;metric units are not of uniform 
length. Instead, they are of variable length, corresponding to expansions or 
contractions in melodic motives.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> These &lsquo;metric units of varying lengths&rsquo; 
are delineated in the score by changing time signatures or by unevenly spaced 
accents within the framework of a steady meter. In either case, the meter 
perceived by the listener does not always correspond to the written time 
signature of the composer, and it is the perceived meter that is the focus of 
this discussion. The concept of &lsquo;varying metric units&rsquo; is not the premise of any 
one author but seems to exist in the academic domain by way of default, in lieu 
of a reasonable alternative. Almost any treatise on modern music will include a 
discussion of meter along these lines. Needless to say, the idea of &lsquo;varying 
metric units&rsquo; compromises the periodic model of meter and confines meter to a 
single, varying course of projection.</p>
<p>[3.2] This issue is taken up by Gretchen Horlacher in &ldquo;Metric Irregularity in 
<i>Les Noces</i></i>: The Problem of Periodicity&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> While acknowledging the periodic 
nature of meter, Horlacher argues an alternative for Stravinsky&rsquo;s music. The 
case is made through analysis, observing the manipulation of a determinant 
motive from <i>Les Noces</i> and the disruptive impact it has on periodicity. The 
motive appears at the outset in stable metric form, projecting a steady meter. 
However, this meter is subsequently challenged by an &lsquo;untimely&rsquo; entry of the 
motive which is displaced from the established course. The displacement is made 
explicit by assigning metric identities to key events within the motive and 
tracing exactly where these identities contradict the established meter, a point 
not always evident in the composer&rsquo;s score. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>. Fixed metric identity and periodicity</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[3.3] This contradiction is illustrated in <b>Example 2</b> with a hypothetical 
motive X, whose four quarter notes (G <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> A) project a <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter. We assign 
each of these notes a 1-2-3-4 metric identity corresponding to the beat they 
project. The motive is repeated seven beats after the onset of the first entry, 
arriving on beat 4 of the established meter. In this repetition the motive&rsquo;s 
1-2-3-4 identity coincides with beats 4-1-2-3 of the steady meter; they no 
longer align. The question then is &lsquo;Should one assign a new metric identity to a 
motive in order to continue counting periodically, or break the periodicity in 
order to preserve the motive&rsquo;s metric identity?&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.4] For Horlacher, metric identity is preserved. Irregularities occur with 
such persistence in Stravinsky&rsquo;s music that listeners learn to admit breaks in 
periodicity without disrupting the flow of the meter. Periodicity is compromised 
in favor of a &lsquo;stop and start meter, one full of interruptions, but still in 
force.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The processes of contraction and elision, fashioned initially for 
hypermetric irregularity, are cited as the means with which foreground 
irregularities are accommodated.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
This corresponds then to the commonly held 
view of irregularities as &lsquo;metric units of varying lengths&rsquo;, lengths determined 
here by the fixed metric identity of a motive and its displacement. As far as it 
critically examines the issues, the article is of lasting value, but what 
Horlacher describes as a &lsquo;stop and start meter&rsquo; is an effect of the invention, 
not the source.</p>
<p>[3.5] It would be worth considering at this point why we choose to preserve a 
motive&rsquo;s metric identity. When has the motive become so important in shaping 
meter? The motive governs metric projection not in deference to some new 
principle binding modern music, but simply in the absence of a single steady 
meter. In <i>The Rite of Spring</i> the orchestral forces seldom unite in the 
projection of a steady meter. Either different parts act in concert to project 
shifting metric patterns, or they act independently of each other, projecting 
different patterns at the same time. These alternatives are identified by van 
den Toorn as rhythmic/metric types I and II.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
This situation is quite 
different from that of the tonal tradition whereby the different parts often 
unite in the projection of a single steady meter. In this case, where a 
suspension or syncopation in one part challenges the meter, the other parts more 
or less hold that meter in place; the metric disruptions are local and short 
lived.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> But while we acknowledge periodicity as a quality of meter, a 
composer is no more bound to a <i>single</i> meter than to a single diatonic 
collection. Stravinsky shows no such commitment, and in the absence of a single 
steady meter, accents&mdash;provided most conspicuously by the motive&mdash;become 
central in metric projection. Metric identity is fixed not as a matter of 
course, but under conditions conducive to its retention. A motive, displaced 
from an established meter for which there is no support, retains metric 
identity. Thus, for Stravinsky, meter and motive are intimately linked. </p>

<p>[3.6] For Pieter van den Toorn issues of displacement and fixed metric identity 
point to the fact that the metric invention exceeds the confines of a single 
meter. Having observed a motive&rsquo;s departure from an established meter by means 
of displacement, van den Toorn notes how successive displacements can 
effectively transfer the motive <i>back</i> to its original course.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 
The 
displacements which unhinged the motive in the first place eventually &lsquo;cancel 
out&rsquo;, placing the motive &lsquo;on target&rsquo; with the meter established at the outset. 
At this point the motive&rsquo;s metric identity and the initial meter realign. For 
van den Toorn, this suggests that the initial meter is in force throughout in 
the form of a steady background meter. At times this meter is explicitly 
projected by an ostinato or accompaniment figure, as in a number of movements 
from <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</i>; otherwise it is projected at strategic points, as 
signaled by the departure and return of the motive, and maintained, perhaps 
internally, by the listener.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
If motive X were to return to an established 
meter twelve beats after the onset of an initial statement, as illustrated in 
<b>Example 3</b>, it would effectively arrive &lsquo;on target&rsquo; with the initial meter, 
lending substance to the notion of a steady background meter. </p>
<p>[3.7] In addition to the workings of this model, van den Toorn provides an 
aesthetic framework within which irregularities start to cohere. Foreground 
irregularities are neither arbitrary nor a game of chance: their imposition over 
a steady background meter creates a tension, a heightened presence. This is 
particularly true for conservative listeners, who &lsquo;cling to an established 
regularity for as long as possible, and often with the consequence that the 
effect of conflict or disruption is all the more acutely felt.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> In this way 
the seemingly contradictory principles of periodicity and irregularity are 
brought together: the background periodic meter, established at the outset and 
reaffirmed at strategic points, acts as a foil to foreground irregularities. 
This state of conflict is defined as metric polarity, or 
&lsquo;rhythmic-metric-identity <i>polarities</i>&rsquo; &mdash; polarities between a motive&rsquo;s metric 
identity and the steady background meter.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> 
The concept is intriguing, and the implications of the departure and return of a 
motive to a single meter are not to be dismissed. But it is questionable whether 
a background meter remains in force throughout where it is not explicitly 
projected, and if it does, is it of sufficient strength to function as a pole 
against which foreground irregularities are perceived?<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>
<h4>IV. Phase-Shift Model</h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 4</b>. Four phases of 4/4 meter</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=3&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 4 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex4_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[4.1] Foreground irregularities are still not given their due. They are not the 
product of varying metric units or changing time signatures, nor are they 
necessarily perceived against a steady background meter. Irregularities arising 
from the displacement of a determinant motive are interpreted here as shifts in 
projection of a number of meters&mdash;parallel meters&mdash;whose time signatures are 
the <i>same</i>, but whose metric patterns are <i>out of phase</i>. Each of these meters 
is periodic in and of itself, and is identical to other parallel meters in all 
respects barring metrical alignment: their beats are synchronized, but their 
1-2-3-4 counts are out of phase. They are in essence different phases of the 
same meter, and, while they coincide, they never merge. To illustrate, in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> 
there are four phases of the same meter whose quarter-note beats coincide. The 
model in <b>Example 4</b> depicts the four phases as parallel lines in graph form. The 
small bar lines mark the measures of each phase through which the out-of-phase 
alignment becomes apparent. The implicit 1-2-3-4 count is written in the first 
complete measure of each phase.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b>.

<p>[4.2] Depicting the meters side by side does not suggest the simultaneous 
projection of all phases. If this were the case, every metric identity would 
sound at once, rendering the model useless for analytic purposes. Neither is it 
supposed that these meters have any existence independent of the music. Rather, 
they illustrate the <i>potential</i> phases of a meter within a given context. The 
phases are projected in accordance with motivic displacement and can be traced 
as follows: One of the meters is established at the outset by a determinant 
motive and to this motive we assign the metric identities 1, 2, 3, or 4, 
corresponding to the beats it projects. The established meter remains in force 
until such time that the motive is displaced so that its metric identity and the 
meter&rsquo;s 1-2-3-4 count no longer align. Despite the contradiction, metric 
identity is retained, forging a shift in projection from the established meter 
to an out-of-phase meter of the same time signature. The motive&rsquo;s metric 
identity serves to indicate which phase of meter is set in motion. This newly 
established meter remains in force until it too is contradicted, at which point 
it serves as a point of departure for the shift in projection, either back to 
the initial meter, or to another of the four phases. An irregularity then is the 
juncture at which the music shifts projection from one phase to another, and as 
interpreted in this model, is rightly regarded as a <i>phase shift</i>. If the 
irregularities caused by the displacement of motive X are interpreted as phase 
shifts, two of the four potential meters are drawn upon. These meters appear 
above the staff in <b>Example 5</b> and their projection is indicated in cue-size 
notation. That the motive departs from and returns to the meter established at 
the outset can be visually apprehended in the model; the first and third 
statements project the same phase of meter. </p>
<p>[4.3] To give credit where it is due, the model of out-of-phase meters is 
identical in principal to Roeder&rsquo;s pulse streams. Roeder prefers the term pulse 
stream over meter as it connotes the continuous flow of music&rsquo;s time. Roeder 
demonstrates how different streams of the same pulse&mdash;phases&mdash;can be activated 
by different strands within a contrapuntal texture. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&lsquo;Essentially the theory represents rhythmic polyphony as two or more concurrent 
&ldquo;pulse streams&rdquo; created by regularly recurring accents. These pulse streams are 
considered to be distinct continuities, not &ldquo;levels&rdquo; or groupings of each other, 
so this approach does not involve meter in the exclusive and hierarchical sense 
defined by the theorists just mentioned. Rather it analyzes an irregular surface 
as the sum of several concurrent regular continuities, much as a Fourier 
transform analyzes a complexly aperiodic sound as the sum of periodic sine 
	waves.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are minor differences in how the two models are presented and naturally 
the observations and conclusions regarding Stravinsky&rsquo;s music differ from those 
of Bartok and Schoenberg. Roeder links rhythmic process with the music&rsquo;s formal 
design, paying particular attention to how pulse streams interact within 
sections, how they articulate boundaries, and how they create continuity. The 
cues from which accents are drawn may or may not be motivically generated. The 
present work focuses on passages in which all voices act in concert to project 
shifting metric patterns. In this &lsquo;single-voice&rsquo; texture only one phase is 
projected at any point and the phase shifts are allied with the action of a 
determinate motive. This work also explores the aesthetic rather than the formal 
implications of the model. It should be noted that an instance of a phase shift 
similar to that described here is given in Example 1 of Roeder&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rhythmic 
Process and Form in Bartok&rsquo;s <i>Syncopation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[4.4] This model also shares certain similarities with that of Benjamin (see 
Example 1). Both employ different meters of the same time signature&mdash;phases&mdash;although Benjamin does not use this term. Here the model is extended to embrace 
all potential phases within a given passage. These meters are depicted side by 
side because irregularities occur with such persistence in Stravinsky&rsquo;s music 
that a number of meters can be brought into play over a short period. It is 
helpful to grasp these meters visually on the hypothetical model: it makes 
intelligible to the eye what is aurally perceived. Benjamin depicts meters 
parallel only at the point of overlap, the purpose of which is to demonstrate 
the dual metric identity of an event at that point. Overlap or dual metric 
identity does not figure prominently here because the phase shift is not the 
result of a dovetailing from one phrase or motive to another. In the absence of 
a steady course of projection, when a motive is displaced with nothing to 
counter it, its metric identity is retained. As a result, the projection of 
meter shifts forcibly from one phase to another without overlap, and so without 
reinterpretation or dual metric identity. Where dual metric identity occurs, it 
does so because there are conflicting metric cues, but this does not entail an 
overlap from one statement of the motive to another.</p>
<h4>V. <i>The Sacrificial Dance </i>I</h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>. Phase-shift analysis of <i>The Sacrificial Dance</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=5&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 6 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex6a_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and see the rest)</font></p></div>

<p>[5.1] To apply this model to Stravinsky, rehearsal numbers 149-60+2 of the 
<i>Sacrificial Dance</i> will be examined, a passage whose complex rhythmic surface 
veils a simple yet ingenious metric design.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></a>
The metric invention here 
derives from a determinant motive&mdash;a chord&mdash;and its alternating projection of 
two phases of meter (see <b>Example 6</b>. We can penetrate this invention for the 
most part by preserving metric identity. The chord, of a sixteenth-note 
duration, functions as a downbeat and is assigned a count 1 identity. Over an 
eighth-note pulse the chord projects a steady <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter when repeated at 
quarter-note periods, a 1-2 succession. However, when the chord is repeated at 
eighth-note periods, fixed metric identity yields a 1-1 succession; the chord&rsquo;s 
count 1 identity falls on successive eighth-note beats. This downbeat succession 
forces a shift in projection from one phase of meter to the other. The 
irregularities, or phase shifts, come by way of eighth-note repetition of the 
chord at the expense of the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter, and the entire passage can be 
accommodated on two out-of-phase meters, whichever meter aligns with the 
downbeat identity of the chord at any point. For instance, at numbers 150+2-4 the 
varied repetition of the chord yields a 1-2 1-2 1-1-2 pattern of identities. The 
consecutive downbeats at number 150+4, 1-1, indicate a shift in phase. </p>
<p>[5.2] More intriguing, and problematic from an analytical viewpoint, is that the 
passage opens with a shift in phase. The first two statements of the chord 
appear in eighth-note succession and retaining metric identity yields two 
successive downbeats. The question here is whether it is possible to perceive a 
shift in phase before the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter has been established. That the first chord 
is perceived as a downbeat is self-evident as it begins the passage. In a 
conventional reading one might interpret the second chord as an upbeat in 
relation to the first. Note, however, the precision of the articulation, the 
exact repetition of the chord, and the absence of any other metric cues give 
weight to fixed metric identity. Under these conditions the second chord, rather 
than being heard as a continuation of the first, retains its downbeat identity; 
it resets the meter, shifting the phase and thus denying the opportunity for the 
first chord to realize a full measure. </p>
<p>[5.3] However, there is an exception to this fixed interpretation. When the 
chord is repeated three times in eighth-note succession, fixed metric identity 
yields a 1-1-1 pattern. A triple succession of downbeats departs from and 
returns to an established meter within a three-beat period. The listener is 
provided with conflicting metric cues, one drawn from fixed metric identity 
(1-1-1) and one drawn from sequent succession (1-2-1), and while we apprehend 
the shifts in phase, they &lsquo;cancel out&rsquo;. The phase shifts, although still in 
evidence, are likely to be subsumed here by a single phase of meter. Example 6 
provides a graphic analysis of the passage as interpreted on two phases of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> 
meter. The lower two staves give the piano reduction of the score (excluding the 
intermittent entries of solo instruments) whilst the upper two staves present 
the two phases of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter. The bracketed note at number 149+3 indicates the first 
instance of a triple succession of downbeats whose phase shifts are subsumed by 
a single meter.</p>
<p>[5.4] It is tempting to assign a principal status to one of the two phases. Such 
a hierarchy would enable us to treat one phase as <i>the</i> meter, and the other as 
a counter-meter or syncopation. However there is scant evidence for this 
interpretation. The action takes place more or less evenly over both phases: a 
total of forty four and forty beats are projected by the upper and lower phases 
respectively. We could also expect that if one phase were of principal status, 
then that phase would figure prominently at the outset. But the passage opens 
with a phase shift, an irregularity which is likely to &lsquo;throw&rsquo; the listener 
rather than establish the dominance of a single phase. The music does favor the 
lower of the two phases between numbers 149-51, but then this preference is 
reversed from numbers 151-54. Towards the climax at number 161 the shifts become 
increasingly frequent, yielding four successive downbeats from number 158+2 and 
five downbeats from number 159. It is difficult to argue the dominance of a single 
phase in the midst of such agile invention. In fact, to do so, even if one were 
statistically evident, might be to miss the point.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[5.5] The graphic analysis constitutes a schema, by means of which the 
irregularities can be counted and shifts in projection traced. However, with 
this model something of the overall aesthetic also begins to emerge. At points 
of irregularity, where the projection of meter shifts from one phase to another, 
a kinetic impulse is issued not unlike that of syncopation, only more forceful, 
one wrought by a shift in phase. It is this impulse which imparts vigor to the 
invention. Now a number of terms could well describe this impulse: phase-shift 
accent, &lsquo;metrical dissonance&rsquo;,<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></a>
	but van den Toorn&rsquo;s &lsquo;metric polarity&rsquo; is 
particularly apt. However, the concept of foreground/background polarity is 
modified here apropos of the present model. Remembering that each phase of meter 
is nothing less than an authentic meter in its own right, each of equal 
<i>potential</i>, it qualifies then as a pole, being self-contained by virtue of its 
periodicity, but standing in opposition to other meters by virtue of its 
out-of-phase alignment. A polarity occurs where projection shifts from one phase 
of meter to another. The two meters at this juncture are the two poles, the 
opposition of which is realized by the shift in projection <i>from</i> one pole <i>to</i> 
the next. It is during the course of the shift that the out-of-phase alignment 
of the two meters is exposed and a polarity occurs (see <b>Example 7</b>). The two poles then are not 
heard together but in succession, and thus they are linear in orientation. Once 
established, the new meter emerges as a point of departure for a further shift 
in projection to any of the other phases, not necessarily that established at 
the outset. In this interpretation polarity takes place entirely at the 
foreground level between different phases of the same meter. If all that is 
required to apprehend the shift is two meters&mdash;two poles&mdash;and neither of these 
need be that stated at the outset, then it follows that the apprehension of this 
phenomenon is not contingent upon a steady background meter. </p>
<p>[5.6] For van den Toorn the concept of polarity rests upon the background meter, 
established at the outset and reaffirmed at strategic points, in simultaneous 
opposition to the foreground irregularities, forming &lsquo;dual, concurrent 
meters&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup>	Pursuant to the present model, whereby the metric poles are heard 
in succession, to suggest that the initial meter remains in force after the 
juncture is to suggest overlap or uncertainty, which would weaken, rather than 
heighten the effect of displacement. To &lsquo;cling to an established regularity&rsquo; 
would indicate that the shift had not forcibly occurred with the result that we 
are unconvinced of the new meter set in motion. Polarity in the <i>Sacrificial 
Dance</i>, or any of the other passage discussed here, is not a continuing state 
between two non-aligned meters, one implied, the other projected. Rather it is 
the fleeting, momentary experience of two self-contained but opposing forces 
brought into contact via the phase shift. When an established meter is 
maintained throughout by an ostinato or accompaniment figure, as in a number of 
movements from <i>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</i>, then there is room for talk of 
foreground/background, metric opposition. One should nevertheless recall that 
the simultaneous conflict between concurrent meters is closer in design to 
polymeter in which conflicting meters are heard simultaneously. With such 
conflict the poles are in vertical, not linear alignment. </p>
<h4>VI. <i>Ritual of the Two Rival Tribes</i></h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[6.1] In the <i>Ritual of the Two Rival Tribes</i> the action takes place entirely in 
the linear domain. At number 57+4 the determinant motive comprises two pitches, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, heard in half-note succession a &lsquo;major-ninth&rsquo; apart (<b>Example 8</b>). 
Together, these pitches project a <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter as written, and are assigned the 
metric identities 1-2 and 3-4 respectively. Note the rhythmic symmetry of the 
motive; it lends conviction to the projection of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter. The motive is 
repeated immediately in the following bar, number 57+5, but altered in 
contradiction of the established meter. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> is shortened from half-note to 
quarter-note, and retains only count 1 of its metric identity. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> is thus 
displaced forward, arriving on the <i>second</i> beat of the bar, but retaining its 
3-4 identity. The metric pattern yielded in this measure is 1-3-4, which places 
the irregularity on the second beat of the bar. At this point the early arrival 
of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&rsquo;s 3 count forces a shift in phase. We experience this shift as a polarity, 
a kick, issued as the out-of-phase alignment of meters is exposed. In context of 
the two bars, the metric pattern is 1-2-3-4 1-3-4, with a distinctive shift from 
1 to 3 in the second bar. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 9</b>. <i>Ritual of the Two Rival Tribes</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=9&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 9 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex9_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[6.2] Fixed metric identity proves invaluable here in identifying the 1-3-4 
irregularity. Conventionally a three-beat succession would be read as a <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> 
measure. Indeed it is barred as such and it seems logical to prefer a sequential 
1-2-3 count. But 1-2-3 and 1-3-4 do not represent the same events, though they 
span the same length. In context of the preceding <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter, a conventional 
1-2-3 count represents an incomplete measure. The absence of beat 4 triggers the 
&lsquo;early&rsquo; arrival of beat 1 in the following bar, effectively displacing that bar 
one beat forward. This would place the irregularity on the <i>fourth</i> beat, the 
beginning of the next bar, 1-2-3-4 1-2-3 1-2-3-4. The early arrival of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> then 
amounts to a syncopation. In contrast, 1-3-4 is not sequential. The absence of 
beat 2 triggers the &lsquo;early&rsquo; arrival of beats 3 and 4, placing the irregularity 
on the <i>second</i> beat, much earlier than in a 1-2-3 reading. In this case the 
middle of the bar is displaced one beat forward and the following bar continues 
in line with its new course, 1-2-3-4 1-3-4 1-2-3-4. While this 1-3-4 pattern 
challenges traditional, or sequential, metric thinking, it reflects what the 
music actually does. The shortening of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> at number 57+5 has immediate impact, 
forcing the unexpected arrival of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> and breaking the symmetry which defined the 
meter at the outset. Even the orchestration, heavy brass, marks the &lsquo;early&rsquo; 
arrival of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>. If the disruption is felt on the second beat, then that is the 
point of irregularity, rendering a conventional 1-2-3 count unsustainable (see 
<b>Example 9</b>). The point is stressed not just because this 1-2-3-4 1-3-4 pattern 
challenges traditional thinking, but because its 1-3 shift is distinctive. This 
pattern is marked for distinction by Stravinsky who employed it towards the end 
of <i>The Rite of Spring</i> (see penultimate chapter) and throughout the fourth 
tableau of <i>The Wedding</i> (<i>Les Noces</i>).<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>

<p>[6.3] The mechanics of this model have been demonstrated where a determinant 
motive is displaced from an established course. These displacements are wrought 
by varying the period at which the motive is repeated, as in the <i>Sacrificial 
Dance</i>, or by altering some aspect of its configuration, as in the <i>Ritual of 
the Two Rival Tribes</i>. However, the projection of out-of-phase meters is not 
limited to the action of a determinant motive. Any event which is able to 
project its metric identity convincingly enough to counter an established meter 
is able to force such a shift. This is precisely what the entry of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> - <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
motive does at number 57+4. Taking for granted the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter established two bars 
earlier at number 57+2, the arrival of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> - <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> half-note succession seven beats 
later marks a shift in phase. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&rsquo;s downbeat identity, count 1, arrives on the 
upbeat of the established meter, count 4. And while the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> - <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> motive is still 
in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, it is not the same phase in motion at number 57+2. That phase is disrupted 
by the &lsquo;early&rsquo; arrival of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, whose downbeat identity signals a phase shift. A 
polarity is issued at this juncture as the alignment of the two phases is 
momentarily exposed. The graphic analysis is extended from numbers 57+2 to 58+6 in 
<b>Example 10</b> and a more complete picture of parallel meters emerges in which 3 
phases are set in motion. </p>



<p>[6.4] It is curious that the composer should bar number 57+3 in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, for the 
graphic analysis shows the music in this passage employing different phases of 
<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter. Why the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> bar? Between the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> bars at number 57+2 and 57+4 there are 
only three beats. The intervening <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> bar naturally measures this three-beat 
period, but does it signal a shift from a <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> to a <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter? According to van 
den Toorn, the &lsquo;initial 4+3 count at number 57+2 might be heard and understood as 
an abbreviation of a &lsquo;rational&rsquo; 4+4 count (with, in other words, Block C [<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] 
entering a quarter-note beat too soon at number 5[7]+4)&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
If so, then the 1-2-3 
count at number 57+3 is heard as an incomplete <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> measure, not a complete <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> 
measure, and as such does not signal an authentic shift to <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>. A 1-2-3 count in 
<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> and an incomplete 1-2-3 count in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> are not the same, though they bear the 
same pattern. <b>Example 11</b> illustrates their difference by invoking Zuckerkandl&rsquo;s 
cyclic concept of meter, the crux of which is that every beat in a measure has a 
unique identity according to its position within a metric cycle. 1-2-3 
represents a complete cycle in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, but only a three-quarter cycle in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup>  
It follows from this that the phenomenon of equivalence class that exists 
between analogous beats of different measures of the same meter does not hold 
true for different measures of different meters. Count 3 represents a close in 
<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, but a midpoint in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>: they don&rsquo;t hold an identical position within the 
bar, so they are not &lsquo;functionally equivalent&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> Just as counts 1-2-3 and 
1-3-4 are not the same, though spanning the same length, likewise with counts 
1-2-3 in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> and 1-2-3 (incomplete) in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>. </p>
<p>[6.5] The distinction between 1-3-4, 1-2-3 in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, and an incomplete 1-2-3 in 
<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, however subtle, is one on which the present model is predicated. If we 
reject this distinction, the music submits to forms of analysis based on &lsquo;metric 
units of varying lengths&rsquo;, a single, changing meter. We are forced then either 
to interpret the music as ametric&mdash;the absence of periodicity intimates that 
meter is no longer in force; or to redefine meter, forgoing periodicity as an 
intrinsic quality, in order to accommodate the invention. But accepting the 
distinction emancipates us from both propositions, neither of which is 
satisfactory. This distinction also raises a fundamental question concerning the 
nature of irregularity: are irregularities ever the result of an authentic 
change between meters of different time signatures? The immediate answer, as far 
as motivic displacement in concerned, is no. Despite the assortment of time 
signatures used to bar the invention, irregularities forged through displacement 
and conflicting metric identity are not the product of changing time signatures, 
and should not be regarded as &lsquo;metric units of varying lengths&rsquo;. It is not the 
time signature, but the phase of meter which alters. This is where the graphic 
analysis is useful, for it allows us to grasp visually the shifts in projection 
of the out-of-phase meters. </p>
<p>[6.6] Nevertheless the analysis does reveal various patterns of metric identity, 
and on the surface these patterns appear to represent &lsquo;metric units of varying 
lengths&rsquo;. These units do not, however, measure the same thing, each unit 
representing the count of a different phase. Belonging then to different phases, 
the units cannot be correlated as a single entity, as <i>the</i> meter. While we 
recognize the confusion here is partly semantic, stemming from what we choose to 
term meter,<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> it is also partly conceptual, the concept of phase being 
overlooked by all but a few observers.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> It is easy nevertheless to see how 
this has come to pass. Imagine the out-of-phase meters casting metric identity 
onto a screen. In shifting from one phase of meter to another, various patterns 
of metric identity are thrown forth. We measure these patterns to determine the 
meter, and conclude that meter is composed of varying lengths, <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>, <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>5</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> and 
so on. The surface pattern of metric identities conceals the phases from which 
they are determined. Varying metric patterns are revealed, such as 1-2-3-4 1-3-4 
in the <i>Ritual of the Two Rival Tribes</i> or 1-2 1-2 1-1-2 in the <i>Sacrificial 
Dance</i>, but these are not in themselves the meter. These patterns serve an 
analytical purpose only as far as they indicate the phase shifts; they otherwise 
hold nothing more than a surface position within the analysis. </p>
<p>[6.7] As for Stravinsky&rsquo;s purpose in barring the music as he did, that is beyond 
the scope of the present article, suffice to say that the written meter does not 
always correspond with that perceived by the listener. This is not to imply any 
lack of design on the composer&rsquo;s part but only to acknowledge that the invention 
transcends the system of notation with which it is written. Like the serial 
composer forced to present certain tones on the diatonic staff as chromatic 
alterations of others, though all twelve are considered equal, so too with 
Stravinsky who recorded the multiple phases of his invention as a single metric 
continuum. Consider number 57 + 2 and 57 + 5 in the Ritual, in which the metric 
patterns 1 2 3 (incomplete <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>) and 1 3 4 are both cast in a conventional <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> 
bar. The shifts in phase are rendered through motivic displacement and made more 
forceful through articulation and accents. The depth of the composer&rsquo;s insight, 
however, is masked by the traditional system of notation. </p>
<h4>VII. <i>The Sacrificial Dance</i> II</h4>
<p>[7.1] In further illustration of phase shifts the model is applied to one of the 
most striking examples of meter in Stravinsky&rsquo;s output, the climactic final of 
<i>The Rite</i>, the closing episode of the <i>Sacrificial Dance</i>. From numbers 186-201 
the music comprises a number of determinate motives which generate and govern 
every aspect of the meter. What distinguishes the action here is that 
irregularities arise not just by the displacement of these motives, but by their 
juxtaposition. They interlock to produce a variety of intricate metric patterns 
which challenge conventional metric thinking. However the episode lends itself 
readily to an analysis of its phase shifts. The design of each motive is 
distinct. Once the determinate motives and metric identity have been established 
and plotted in the graphic analysis, the complexities of the passage emerge with 
new clarity. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 12</b>. Phase-shift analysis of <i>Sacrificial Dance</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="woodruff_examples.php?id=12&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 12 thumbnail" src="woodruff_ex12_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[7.2] The underlying meter for the episode is 4/16 (<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>), and the unit at which 
the disruptions occur is the sixteenth-note. The invention then is accommodated 
on four out-of-phase 4/16 meters. Rather than detailing an account of the entire 
passage, the first two determinant motives are examined together with points of 
significance, followed by a graphic analysis in <b>Example 12</b>. For the sake of 
brevity the analysis will extend only as far as number 189+2.</p>
<p>[7.3] The key to the entire episode, on which much of the analysis is focused, 
is motive A, the two-note figure of the bass at number 186. Doubled at various 
points by timpani, tuba, and contrabassoon, the bass is pivotal in determining 
the downbeats throughout, although it may not receive the same orchestral 
prominence as other motives. In its determinant form, the motive comprises two 
pitches, A and C, in eighth-note succession. Over a sixteenth-note pulse they 
project a 4/16 meter and acquire a metric identity of 1-2 and 3-4 respectively. 
The rhythmic symmetry of the motive reinforces their 1-2 and 3-4 identities. The 
accompanying chords of this motive, the &lsquo;right hand&rsquo; at the piano, punctuate the 
upbeats. These chords are not assigned a fixed metric identity but fill in the 
gaps in relation to the bass, beats 2 and 4.</p>
<p>[7.4] Motive A is stated in full at number 186. Cast in a 5/16 bar, the two 
eighth-notes A and C project a 1-2-3-4 count in 4/16. The final sixteenth note 
of the bar, A, begins a varied repetition of the motive. However, as its value 
is halved, A projects only count 1 before the arrival of C with its count 3 &lsquo;too 
soon&rsquo; in the following bar. This displacement yields a 1-2-3-4 1-3 pattern with 
the same distinctive 1-3 shift as in the <i>Ritual of the Two Rival Tribes</i>. The 
sixteenth-note level is shallower here, the meter being cast at the quarter-note 
level in the <i>Ritual</i>, and it is barred differently to accommodate other events. 
However, if these passages are heard and compared &lsquo;side by side&rsquo; the 1-3 shift 
is unmistakable, though more to the ear than the eye. This pattern acquires a 
certain identity of its own as it is repeated seven times before number 192, each 
time signaling a 1-3 phase shift.</p>
<p>[7.5] Motive B at number 186+1 comprises the string&rsquo;s three sixteenth-note chords 
whose 2-3-4 metric identity coincides with their position within the bar. This 
proves something of an anomaly for the whole bar, a metric pattern of 3-2-3-4. 
How can C&rsquo;s 3 count be followed by 2-3-4 of motive B? The fixed metric identity 
of the bass has been established, so count 3 is defensible. The key is that the 
metric identity of motive B is not shaped by the events that precede it. The 
motive itself in its pitch, rhythm, and form, delineates the accents from which 
we infer metric identity. The three sixteenth-note chords of motive B lead into 
a restatement of motive A whose downbeat entry in the following bar is 
unmistakable. The effect of the three notes is of a lead-in, an anacrusis. This 
gesture is distinct, easily identified by the listener, and so the motive&rsquo;s 
2-3-4 metric identity exists independently of prior events. The invention here 
is extreme and the interpretation may test the credulity of some listeners, but 
is anything to be gained by sacrificing C&rsquo;s fixed 3 identity to preserve a 
1-2-3-4 periodic count? Periodicity is already preserved, four times over, in 
the out-of-phase meters.</p>
<p>[7.6] Motive A and its displacement interlock with motive B in the first two 
bars, yielding a combined metric pattern of 1-2-3-4 1-3-2 3-4. This pattern 
embraces a jump from 1 to 3, and a retrogression from 3 to 2. Bearing in mind 
that non-sequential beats belong to different phases of the same meter, it is 
not as ametric as it appears. The 1-3-2 succession is the consequence of fixed 
metric identity, displacement, and juxtaposition. Metric identity is disclosed 
here in accordance with the events which project it, and although these events 
tend in sequence, their metric patterns need not. A 1-3-2 succession, impossible 
on a single periodic model of meter, is entirely plausible in the context of 
out-of-phase meters.</p>
<p>[7.7] Stravinsky&rsquo;s timing was impeccable, and it is evident if we extend the 
analysis into the final measures that a single steady meter does surface towards 
the end, the same phase on which the episode started. It is doubtful, however, 
that a steady background meter is founded on these points alone as the phase 
established at the outset is so brief. These strategic points confirm not the 
presence of a background meter, but the referential function of a single phase. 
Commencing and concluding the passage with the same phase could serve to unify 
or impart closure to the passage. But the action itself takes place more or less 
equally over all four phases, and the polarity, the thrust of the invention, 
occurs at the foreground level in linear alignment.</p>
<h4>VIII. Conclusion</h4>
<p>[8.1] The attraction of the model proposed here lies in its ability to unify 
some of the complex metric events of <i>The Rite of Spring</i>. Irregularities 
arising by way of displacement are cohesively bound on a system of out-of-phase 
meters of the same time signature. This interpretation spares us from redefining 
meter, foregoing periodicity as an intrinsic quality, to accommodate the 
invention. In the broader sense periodicity is not forfeit but intensified: in 
shifting projection from one phase of meter to another, periodicity is made to 
conflict with itself. Van den Toorn eloquently describes this process in the 
following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Themes, motives, and chords are repeated not to be developed along 
	traditional lines but to be displaced. And in seeking thus to displace a 
	repeated theme, motive, or chord, the composer retains features other than 
	alignment in order that alignment itself (and its shifts) might be set in 
	relief.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[8.2] It is clear that in listening to <i>The Rite of Spring</i> we are granted an 
experience of meter beyond that of the ordinary. Stravinsky portrays a meter not 
bound by sequence. By unlocking its potential phases, music&rsquo;s time is made to 
jump forward, remain static, and even reverse. These maneuvers materialize as a 
result of the manipulation of the determinant motive and the different phases 
thus set in motion. It is tempting even to speculate a cognitive discord which 
exists between our conflicting experiences of time passing&mdash;chronometric time&mdash;and that of meter. For, as much as we are drawn into <i>The Rite of Spring</i> and 
partake of the experience it records, ultimately the clock will reveal that no 
span of real time has been elided, arrested or reversed. It is a satisfying 
experience nonetheless, and a measure of the composer&rsquo;s insight into the sound 
world which is music&rsquo;s domain.</p>

	<p><a name="FN1">1.</a> A single course of projection refers here to a single 
periodic meter. The concept of meter as projection is taken from Christopher 
Hasty, <i>Meter as Rhythm</i>. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997) and 
denotes meter &lsquo;as a process internal to the sounds themselves, an experience, 
rather than something already determined in advance and imposed from without.&rsquo;

with Hasty&rsquo;s, and while Hasty&rsquo;s concept of meter is refreshing, it is not fully 
assimilated here. The current model, printed as part of a thesis in 1996, was

rather than something already determined in advance and imposed from without.&rsquo; 
See Joseph P. Swain, &ldquo;Shifting Metre.&rdquo; <i>Music Analysis</i> 20/1 (2001): 119&ndash;41
