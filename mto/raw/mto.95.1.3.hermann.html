<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>[1] In his article &ldquo;Relating Sets: On Considering a
Computational Model of Similarity Analysis,&rdquo; <i>Music Theory
Online</i> 1.2 (1995), Thomas R. Demske seeks to use techniques of
cluster analysis upon similarity relations found between pc-sets &ldquo;abstracted from post-tonal analysis.&rdquo; He finds that the
evaluation component that would define the boundary values for
cluster analysis (which group similarity function return
values between sets into rough equivalence classes) most
difficult to find, that &ldquo;the similarity relationship is too
abstract to imply guidelines for its own application,&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;other potential criteria resist formal implementation.&rdquo;
He further states that &ldquo;other more commonly used tools in
post-tonal analysis are susceptible to the concerns raised
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[2] Demske raises some important issues about the inherent
nature and limitations of similarity relations, computational
models, and typically used analytical techniques for post-tonal music.  This response briefly reviews some his concerns
but will not alleviate them.  Instead, this response places
similarity relationships into broader contexts and then
suggests how they might reasonably be used with other post-tonal theoretical tools of fairly recent vintage.  While my
suggested approach might ease his discomfort somewhat, other
interesting issues arise.  Unfortunately, due to the broad
issues summoned by Demske and due to the limitations of space
in this forum, my response can only broadly sketch the
approach.   It is hoped that this response might spark
continued responses upon the issues surrounding post-tonal
theory; recent composition; history, analysis, perception and
perhaps even the sociology of post-tonal music that Demske
reopens or implies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Four of Demske&rsquo;s Dissatisfactions with Abstract Similarity
Relations</b></p>
<p>[3] 1) The author seems to find fault with the fact that 
similarity relations lack transitivity, although he does not
mention the transitive property in his essay.  See his
footnote three where he writes &ldquo;Blind subset polling is a
basic source of such barriers. Two REL calls with the same
pivot may yield identical results, and yet differ with respect
to the types of subsets counted.  Ignoring the degree of this
difference when comparing REL value spreads strikes me as
questionable.&rdquo; Similar thoughts are found in paragraph [10].  </p>
<p>[4] By definition, similarity relations lack transitivity.
Thus, if transitivity is valued so highly that its lack
becomes a standard for rejection of a theory, then much of
value  will be lost to post-tonal analysis. For instance,
similarity relations might just be the class of tools best
used to describe how change is accomplished from one process
or segment to another differing process or segment within a
work.  Similarity relations might also be of analytical use in
describing interesting instances of variation such as might
occur in Schoenberg&rsquo;s concept of developing variations.  Other
compelling uses will be discussed shortly.</p>
<p>[5] 2) Demske sees as flawed a situation where some
collection of set-classes can be grouped together in different
ways by the similarity relation REL depending upon which pc-set is selected as the &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; set-class.  Again, see his
third footnote and paragraph [10].  The pivot set-class is the
set-class which is held as a constant in measuring the
similarity relation with each of the other set-classes.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p>[6] The flaw described in paragraph [5] above could be seen as
a virtue. For instance, when a member of set-class 3-11 [037]
is found at a temporal posterior border of an octatonic
collection and as a temporal anterior border of an abutting
diatonic collection, it seems reasonable and even desirable
for formal and abstract similarity relations to yield
different return values between the octatonic collection and
the member of set-class 3-11 and between the diatonic
collection and the 3-11 member in that context.  The passage
of time through the passage does change the &ldquo;color&rdquo; of the
member of 3-11.</p>
<p>[7] 3) Demske finds that intuition can be mightily strained
in attending, in the abstract, to all of the possible
similarity relations that occur between all of the set-classes. See his paragraph [12].  </p>
<p>[8] While we need to be aware of the potentialities of
similarity in the abstract, we only need in analysis to attend
to those reasonable relationships pertaining to the piece or
segment under consideration.</p>
<p>[9] 4) The author seems to resist context sensitive criteria
such as a selected collection of set-classes to be used as the
metaphoric yardstick such as Lewin&rsquo;s TEST from which to
measure similarity.  See his paragraph [13] and footnote
number four in that regard.  </p>
<p>[10] Context sensitive criteria  seem reasonable when the
repertoire under study has already shown that individual
pieces inhabit the post-tonal pc set world in very different
ways.  Also, certain segments at various levels of formal
design within the same piece may also inhabit that world in
significantly different ways.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Two Problems Encountered in the Essay</b></p>

<p>[11] 1) At times Demske appears to veer between
formalist theoretical statements or claims and
phenomenological or perceptual observations and desires. He
judges one by the values of the other.  In paragraph [16] he
writes: &ldquo;The idea that any formal evaluation procedure could
embrace all of the [analytical segmentational] possibilities
seems untenable. On what bases would a partial set of
possibilities be selected for implementation? Since the
different criteria may address different&mdash;and possibly
conflicting&mdash;aspects of perception, how would the application
of one criterion be coordinated with that of another?&rdquo; </p>
<p>[12] All analysts must make decisions about what strikes
them as the most salient or important features of the piece
and then select the appropriate &ldquo;formal evaluation procedure&rdquo;
designed to address those features.  Certainly to run all
possible theoretical tools at the piece in an analysis would
quickly overwhelm the analyst with a plethora of analytical
observations upon the data: most observations are likely to be
true, but many may be of little significance, aural or
otherwise.  Thus, the selection and use of theoretical  tools
for analysis acts like a set of filters upon the analyst and
the piece at hand.  It seems then that Demske&rsquo;s disagreement may
well lie with the selection of tools&mdash;that is, with
what is to be considered perceptually important, rather than
with the nature of the formalist tool itself.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  If a
carpenter selects a hammer to cut a board, then poor results
can be expected.</p>

<p>[13] 2) In the essay, the reader may get the sense that Demske expects
too much from any given class of theoretical tools such as the here
discussed similarity relations.  For example, in traditional tonal
music the theory of harmony fails in explaining supertonic expansions
through voice-exchange and in progressions found within some
sequences.  Consider, for example, Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Piano Concerto</i> number 9
in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major, K. 271/II at measures 28 through 30 as an instance of
supertonic expansion, where a supertonic harmony at measure 28 is
followed by a tonic in measure 29 (an &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; harmonic elision); or
Bach&rsquo;s <i>Little Prelude</i>in C major, BWV 924, at measures one through
three, as an instance of a sequence where the harmonies go &ldquo;backward&rdquo;
along the circle of fifths (I&ndash;V&ndash;II&ndash;VI&ndash;III, &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; harmonic
retrogressions).  These can be found respectively on pages 132&ndash;33 and
253&ndash;254 in Aldwell and Schachter&rsquo;s <i>Harmony and Voice-Leading</i>, 2nd
ed. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1989. The problem here is not
so much with the theory of harmony&mdash;although it does have its well-known 
problems&mdash;but rather with knowing when the use of the theory of
harmony is appropriate.  In these tonal instances, the effects of
structural outer voice counterpoint, form, rhythm and so forth inform
how the theory of harmony&mdash;<i>Stufen</i> in this case&mdash;is reasonably to be
employed. For instance in the case of the Mozart, analysts need to
realize that the tonic harmony is not functional but rather is the
result of harmonizing a deeper layer passing tone with an incomplete
neighbor&mdash;a contrapuntal relation&mdash;between the outer voices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Demske&rsquo;s Example of Abstract Similarity Relation Failure in a
Passage from the First Movement, <i>Liturge de cristal</i>, of
Messiaen&rsquo;s <i>Quatour pour la fin du temps</i></b></p>

<p>[14] In paragraphs [14] through [17] and their accompanying figures,
Demske notes that&mdash;within the repeating sequence of 29 chords&mdash;his
intuitions of aural similitude run counter to the rough agreement
found in the analytical results of Lewin&rsquo;s REL, Rahn&rsquo;s ATEMB, and
Morris&rsquo;s ASIM similarity relations upon this chordal sequence.  Their
results are elegantly displayed in Demske&rsquo;s Figure 5.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> In the
context he has shown, Demske&rsquo;s complaint that these abstract
similarity relations yield poor results from the vantage of aural
similitude is clearly on target: the master&rsquo;s hammer was the wrong
tool indeed.  Brian C. Robison, in responding to Demske&rsquo;s intuitions,
brings his own more appropriate tool to bear upon the passage: it
deals more directly with pitches of the score and gives a plausible
explanation for Demske&rsquo;s intuitions.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Clearly, ASIM, ATEMB, and REL
are too &ldquo;coarsely grained&rdquo; for this particular situation while
Robison&rsquo;s more &ldquo;finely grained&rdquo; work is here more suitable.  Perhaps
in some other post-tonal music with frequent octave duplications the
more coarsely grained tools would better reflect aural similitude than
Robison&rsquo;s tool.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Two Further Complaints of Mine About Existing Resemblance
Relations</b></p>
<p>[15] 1) Until quite recently, resemblance relations
have typically concerned themselves with resemblance between
pitch-sets through the powerfully reductive concepts of pitch-class and set-class.  Resemblance relations that address
musical dimensions such as pitch-space, time, timbre, sound
source direction, and so forth have just recently begun to
appear.  </p>
<p>[16] 2)  Apart from some work on serial music, I am
aware of no work yet in print that simultaneously addresses
resemblance relations in more than one musical dimension.  In
order to get a better fit between formal models and aural
similitude for some important pieces in the repertoire,
multidimensional resemblance relations need to be
investigated.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Towards an Analytical Method for Post-Tonal Music: A
Provisional Sketch</b></p>
<p>[17] Another way of looking at this situation is in speculating that
some sort of unknown or partially known &ldquo;grammar&rdquo; may well dictate
when and where various existing post-tonal analytical tools are to be
best employed. If that grammar is even partially known, it might even
suggest where gaps in our knowledge need to be filled.  It may be
possible now to start the discussion of how some recent tools might
fit together with older ones within an overall sketch of a new
post-tonal analytical method. That we are likely to disagree on this
sketched method is highly probable; note how difficult it is/has been
to obtain general agreement on a precisely specified teaching
methodology for tonal analysis.  And that lack of agreement is over a
repertoire that has enjoyed several hundred years of intense
theoretical contemplation and analytical study.  Nonetheless, we gain
insight into what is lacking by evaluating how various methods of
combining tools fare.  As pieces inhabit the post-tonal worlds in
different ways, I suspect that multiple methods of combining and
selecting tools will be necessary.</p>
<p>[18] Discussion of Demske&rsquo;s complaints about some abstract similarity
relations has shown that in order to get formal analytical results
that correlate with our sense of aural similitude, our tools must be
employed at the correct level of precision.  In the Messiaen example,
the pitch-class/set-class similarity approach was counter-intuitive
while a pitch-space approach was more successful.  Recent developments
in contour theory and investigations into different kinds of musical
spaces now suggest that post-tonal analysis can have a variety of
spaces available to it ranging from the most diffuse on up to the most
precise.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> On the most diffuse extreme, spaces whose elements lack
identifiable intervals between them&mdash;called &ldquo;preintervallic&rdquo;&mdash;have
been investigated and those investigations have yielded interesting
insights into form and instrumental/relative register assignments.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>More precise are spaces inhabited by the relative or ordinally based
intervals found in the various contour theories.  Here, only
inequalities can rank the elements within the space. Note that Marvin
and Hermann have also extended contour theory to musical dimensions
other than pitch.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Next in precision are those intervals such as the
familiar interval-classes that are collapsed from an infinite space
onto a finite space through modulo arithmetic.  And yet greater in
precision are the absolute intervals, such as the distances between
equal-tempered pitches.  Certainly other kinds of intervals lurk in
between these: see the Morris and Lewin writings of footnote six
above.  Recent theoretical developments in post-tonal theory occurring
since ASIM, ATEMB, and REL have widened the scope for development of
resemblance relations in other musical dimensions and subdimensions
and have even started to show how they can be coordinated.  See
footnotes two and five above.  With research continuing in the fields
of musical spaces, resemblance relations in other musical dimensions,
and multidimensional or multisubdimensional similarity, analysts will
soon have a greater variety of tools to select in order to best model
their perceptions of aural similitude.</p>

<p>[19] When faced with music by composers such as
Peter Maxwell Davies, Morton Feldman, or Ralph Shapey&mdash;to give only
a few examples in which there is no known or reasonably
convincing and widely accepted &ldquo;grammar&rdquo; to act as a guide in
analysis&mdash;how might we more profitably proceed?<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[20] After the analyst becomes thoroughly familiar with
the music&rsquo;s sound and symbol, the first issue to be faced is
segmentation: into what units should the piece be divided? 
Recent work by Polansky and Uno, following work by Tenney, use
principles of Gestalt psychology to create computer-based
formal procedural models for segmentation.  These models are
explicitly multidimensional. After Tenney, formal segments are
called temporal gestalt units, and these formal units can nest
within one another several layers deep. Gestalt psychology
investigates the role of shape in perception. Thus, these
shape oriented theories of segmentation are likely to
coordinate well with the new contour space theories because they
are also concerned with shape in various dimensions. In this
light, contour theory can profitably be thought of as a kind
of abstract master dimension.  Segmentations that arise from
formalist theories sensitive to the perceptual issues of shape
will go a ways towards eliminating Demske&rsquo;s complaint of
&ldquo;blind subset polling.&rdquo;  Lefkowitz and Taavola, Brinkman, and
Hasty have also made contributions to this developing area of
segmentation in post-tonal theory.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>

<p>[21] The next issue to be faced might best be described by the
question: What levels of precision&mdash;that is what kinds of musical
space&mdash;best capture the intuitions of relatedness and dissimilarity in
the piece?  Here, multidimensional or multisubdimensional similarity
relations can act as a heuristic to narrow the number of interesting,
potentially applicable musical spaces to those likely to yield the
best results.  Those multidimensional or multisubdimensional
similarity relations yielding probabilistic return values scaled
through standard deviation techniques can do an analysis of the
potentials of the spaces themselves in the abstract, an <i>a priori</i>
analysis.  Then, those results can be compared with empirically
derived results from the score: an <i>a posteriori</i> statistical and
probabilistic analysis.  Where the two sets of results do not
significantly correlate, important features of a relevant grammar may
have been identified.  Follow up analyses of the segments&mdash;selected by
shape based segmentation theories&mdash;could then be done using
equivalence class analysis, resemblance relations, and so forth,
designed for those specific musical spaces.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Relations, operations,
and transformations that significantly preserve shape are preferred to
those that do not preserve shape.  This analytic process seems likely
to reveal a good ratio of &ldquo;hearable&rdquo; structures to other less
&ldquo;hearable&rdquo; structures.  The fruits of those tailored analytical
processes can then be organized as strings of operators, networks of
various kinds, and so forth as is appropriate to the music.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Conclusion: A Wish</b></p>
<p>[22] As these formalist techniques are all easily
amenable to computer implementation&mdash;and many have been so
implemented&mdash;I wish that these tools could all be found in one
big sophisticated suite of software.  Pieces could be encoded
and loaded into database-like structures so that analysts
could then follow their intuitions and call up the needed
software tools designed for the specific kinds of musical
spaces desired and use them on the work.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>

<p>[23] Although much theoretical work has been done since ASIM, ATEMB,
and REL made their first appearances in 1980&mdash;and only a small amount
of the work could be cited here&mdash;much more yet remains to be done in
understanding the various musical spaces and designing appropriate
equivalence class and resemblance relation tools for them.  One
benefit of continuing this line of research is that &ldquo;updating&rdquo; ASIM,
ATEMB, and REL for use in other dimensions and for use in
multidimensional and multisubdimensional analysis is possible.  Marvin
and Laprade have already updated ATEMB for use with their contour
theory (see footnote number eight).  While other quite important
contributions and issues such as timbre theory, atonal voice-leading,
and the influence of feminist thought, among others, upon analysis of
this repertoire can only be barely mentioned or imagined here, it is
time to start the discussion of how and when it is appropriate to use
various combinations of these theoretical entities.  Demske&rsquo;s reminder
about these issues deserves our serious attention, and calls for
discussion to begin.</p>

	<p><a name="FN1">1.</a> Lewin has noted that Demske&rsquo;s use of REL is not completely in accord with Lewin&rsquo;s definition.  Instead of a single pivot set-class, Lewin uses a collection of set-classes called TEST selected from the local context.  REL measures similarity of other analytically interesting set-classes, collectively called COMPARE, with those from TEST.  See Lewin&rsquo;s mto-talk message of 22 Mar <a href="#lewin_1995" id="citation_lewin_1995_67dc9be303db0">1995</a> and especially his &ldquo;A Response to a Response: On PCSet Relatedness,&rdquo; <i>Perspectives of New Music</i> 18.1&ndash;2 (<a href="#lewin_1980" id="citation_lewin_1980_67dc9be303db5">1980</a>, 498&ndash;502) where the definition of REL is found.<br><a href="#FN1REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN2">2.</a> In his mto-talk message of 30 March <a href="#lewin_1995" id="citation_lewin_1995_67dc9be303db7">1995</a>, David Lewin writes: &ldquo;While the word [similarity] is suggestive, it might be a good idea to stop using it in formal theoretical discourse, because the intuitions it invokes are not all that reliable. (Except we probably can't stop using it at this stage of matters,<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo; I suggest that we retain the use of the word <i>similarity</i> for formal relations that possess reflexivity and symmetry, but lack transitivity as mathematicians would have it: see Seymour Lipschutz, <i>Discrete Mathematics</i>, (<a href="#lipschutz_1976" id="citation_lipschutz_1976_67dc9be303db9">1976</a>, 28). We then might use Robert D. Morris&rsquo;s phrase <i>aural similitude</i>&mdash;from his &ldquo;A Similarity Index for Pitch-Class Sets,&rdquo; <i>Perspectives of New Music</i> 18/2 (1979&ndash;80): 445&ndash;60, as Demske acknowledges in his paragraph 5&mdash;when we wish to discuss perceptual matters.  I also propose that, following a suggestion of Morris&rsquo;s, we use the term <i>resemblance relation</i> when we discuss relations that model inclusion relations whether or not they are formally similarity relations. These relations then potentially model some modest sense of &ldquo;aural similitude&rdquo; in the abstract.  Whether or not these relations actually do model perception in a specific passage depends upon whether the passage exhibits its materials in such a way that encourages its perception with that tool by a reasonably experienced listener. See Richard Hermann, &ldquo;A General Measurement for Similarity Relations: A Heuristic for Constructing or Evaluating Aspects of Possible Musical Grammars,&rdquo; Ph.D. Dissertation, Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, 1994: 1&ndash;119 for a classification system for resemblance relations and a mathematical and historical evaluation of published resemblance relations.
