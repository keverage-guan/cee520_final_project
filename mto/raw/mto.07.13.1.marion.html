<p>[1]
The topic of recollection in Debussy can be broached in any number of ways. I 
will explore the means by which recollection assumes strategic significance in 
portions of &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve,&#8221; <i>Pour le piano, </i>and &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s [sic] Cakewalk.&#8221; One of 
the central concerns in each of these works is the manner in which Debussy both 
invokes and impedes communion between old and new compositional practices. The 
article thus seeks to address Debussy&#8217;s positioning of the &#8220;present&#8221;&#8212;his 
present&#8212;as the fashioning of a musical language that is at once backward and 
forward oriented; said in another way, Debussy&#8217;s allusions to aspects of the 
past&#8212;both musical and extra-musical in nature&#8212;are responsible for shaping a 
future based upon generative procedures antithetical to those of the precursors 
he calls to mind. It may even be that Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;now&#8221; represents an emergence 
predicated upon remembrance of the past for the very purpose of eclipsing it.<p>
[2]
By design the three studies that follow are intended to be independent of one 
another&#8212;the only real common thread among them relates to approach. In 
valorizing the concept of <i>aper&ccedil;u</i> I mean to provide glimpses into the imaginative 
space of what came to fill Debussy&#8217;s <i>tabula rasa.</i> Here, the vague term 
recollection will come to take on a plurality of meanings, including memory: in 
an intra-psychic sense; as nostalgia; as the &#8220;anxiety of influence&#8221;; as the 
allusion to historical musical styles; and as the after-image of a particular 
historical work (Wagner&#8217;s <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  This tack is reflective of the 
very backdrop against which Debussy composed, for<i> fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> Paris (c. 1890&#8211;1914) was a Mecca for interdisciplinary leanings in the arts and the sciences 
alike. Moreover the era possessed a palpable collective consciousness of the 
rapid changes that were taking place along cultural, economic, and societal 
lines&#8212;perhaps even to the extent of sponsoring the burgeoning cross-disciplinary 
focus itself.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>Interrogations into the nature of time, encountered in virtually 
all modes of <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> intellectual thought, served as one of the more 
ubiquitous and hence unifying rubrics of the era.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>
The case is no different for 
Debussy, where temporal issues are explored via the manner in which the past is 
accessed, metaphorically brought to life, and subsequently challenged in each of 
&#8220;De r&ecirc;ve,&#8221; <i>Pour le piano, </i>and &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk.&#8221;<p>
[3]
Time consciousness was often coupled with another of the era&#8217;s concerns, namely 
for the spatial, as the two domains are connected in intricate ways. Indeed, as 
Stephen Kern so eloquently points out, the numbing changes in technology and 
culture in the 40 years punctuated by the close of World-War I sponsored the 
institution of new modes of experiencing time and space as witnessed in the many 
artistic and scientific advances of the period.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
<p>
[4]
Innovation was encountered at every turn: in the world of art C&eacute;zanne, Picasso, 
and van Gogh collectively critiqued perspective, figure-ground relationships, 
and the expanded role of color and light in painting; Proust, Joyce, and Woolf 
challenged the temporal flow of novels and the continual shaping and reshaping 
of the past, the present, and the future by plumbing the depths of an 
individual&#8217;s consciousness; on entirely different fronts there was the 
conquering of the globe by Peary who reached the North Pole in 1909, and 
Amundsen the South Pole in 1911; and finally, with one brush-stroke Einstein&#8217;s 
theories of relativity placed before humanity the humbling concept of a dynamic 
universe.<p>
[5]
It is necessary neither to inventory nor to understand the quantity, the scope, 
or even the pace of change in the Western world during Debussy&#8217;s lifetime; it is 
enough to grasp something of the tenor of the era, and to remember that the 
dissemination of information&#8212;be it of trends in the arts, of regional or world 
events, or even of political propaganda&#8212;was more widespread and more 
instantaneous than at any earlier point in history. The invention of the 
telegraph, the telephone, and in interesting ways the cinema, contributed to the 
simultaneous contraction of the earth and the expansion of the landscape of the 
mind.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
<p>
[6]
Such, then, was the cultural and creative backdrop for Debussy. And being both 
in and of the era, Debussy sought to reflect the pitch of its experimental 
nature, and spoke openly of doing so, as the following familiar 1913 quotation 
attests:<blockquote>
	<p>Is it not our duty<nobr> . . . </nobr> [to] find the symphonic formulae best suited to the 
audacious discoveries of our modern time, so committed to progress? The century 
of aeroplanes has a right to a music of its own. Let those who support our art 
not be left to waste away in the lowest rank of our army of inventors, let them 
not be outdone by the genius of engineers!<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>
In a compositional sense Debussy answered his own call to duty in numerous ways, 
and the retooling of temporal and spatial concerns was principal among them.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
Here that retooling is intimately linked to the notion of recollection.<p>
[7]
Although an oversimplification of a complex issue, much of what might be deemed 
the unfolding of the drama in a musical composition dating from the 
common-practice era does so in tandem with the unidirectional flow of the 
timeline. As a result, the manner in which earlier and later events inform one 
another in a piece, say, by Haydn&#8212;while not without consequence&#8212;is inscribed in 
predictable ways. Even the powerful notion of &#8220;surprise&#8221; in tonal repertoires is 
often attributable to temporary challenges issued against, but never replacing, 
the orderly move toward the inevitable.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> All of this was to change with Debussy, 
who came to question the very impact that &#8220;earlier&#8221; and &#8220;later&#8221; might hold in a 
musical sense, and in so doing, uniquely positioned what accrual of information 
was to mean in every one of his works.<p style="text-align: center">

<a name="DeReve"></a>[8]
&#8220;De r&ecirc;ve&#8221; is the lead song in the cycle <i>Proses lyriques</i> (1892&#8211;95).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>  The fact 
that we have recourse to the interaction of textual and musical concerns makes 
this piece ideal for an initial pass at recollection in Debussy&#8217;s music. What is 
more, Debussy himself penned both the poetry and the music of the cycle.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> </p>

Lines one through five of the poem correspond to measures 1&#8211;18 of the music. In 
these opening measures the ever-changing musical surface features the 
commingling of non-diatonic and diatonic passages coupled with shifts in rhythm, 
tempo and dynamics, all of which highlights a phasing between two musical 
traditions, the present (Debussy&#8217;s present) and the past, and the shift among 
realms is underscored textually.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> The non-diatonic framework from the opening of 
the piece gives over (in measure 6 and following) to a tonal span initially 
suggestive of B minor, and with it comes Debussy&#8217;s textual/musical shift into a 
recollected past. Before the end of the excerpt, chromaticism nearly undermines 
the tonal orientation, but ultimately abates with the arrival of the A major 
chord in measure 18. Yet the seemingly disparate soundscapes represent a tightly knit 
structure.<p>

<b>Figure 2</b> proposes a three-sectioned segmentation of measures 1&#8211;18. Here is the 
text:</p>

In section 1, a narrative sequence leads from a metonymical relationship to a 
concluding injunction.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>  In the former, an attribute of womanhood (softness) 
stands for night and all that it entails; in the latter, the injunction 
&#8220;Songent!&#8221; [Reflect!] breaks the effemeral hold of the first two lines and is 
multiply directed&#8212;toward the personified trees, the narrator, and in equal 
measure to the poem&#8217;s reader. In section 2 descriptive prose replaces the 
earlier figurative language and introduces a temporal change to a state of 
recall. The image of &#8220;the recently deceased/Her head covered with pearls&#8221; is 
unleashed from memory by the initial word of line 3, &#8220;Songent!&#8221; [Reflect!] The 
recollection proves to be short-lived, for it is interrupted in section 3 by 
another swerve. In &#8220;Maintenant navr&eacute;e, &agrave; jamais navr&eacute;e&#8221; [Now regretting, forever 
regretting] &#8220;Maintenant&#8221; acts in the same manner as &#8220;Songent!&#8221; had before it, 
triggering the move from one temporal state to another, and by so doing 
establishes the correct orientation of a regret.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup><p>
[11]
The musical setting meshes with the temporal shifts in the text. For instance, B 
minor is in play over much of measures 6&#8211;13; but its hold is equivocal, for the 
tonal language of the passage captures the spirit of days past, but stops short 
of assimilating fundamental traits of the common-practice period, such as 
complete deference to the gravitational pull of a single tonic. Metaphorically, 
something remains of the earlier time, and yet it is not wholly available to a 
present whose connection to it is through recollection. It is with these curious 
issues in mind that we retreat to the outset of &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve.&#8221;

<p>[12] Much is transpiring in the opening two measures, where at least three 
distinct arpeggiating strands interact; the lower edge of the piano&rsquo;s gesture 
unfolds the familiar Debussyan sound of a harmonically non-functional French 
augmented-sixth chord; and at the upper edge, the piano&rsquo;s right hand toggles 
between an augmented triad&mdash;whose root, for agogic and other reasons (see below), 
is F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&mdash;and 
an A-flat major chord. The voice, setting the initial line of the poem, 
underscores pitches of the piano&rsquo;s upper arpeggios. The <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> augmented triad 
starts out as a non-diatonic event&mdash;carrying whole-tone implications that while 
not explored thoroughly in this article, are realized elsewhere in the song.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>
The &#8220;present&#8221; is made palpable in the non-functionality of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> augmented 
chord with respect to the harmonic procedures of Debussy&rsquo;s classical- and 
romantic-era forebears. But later in the passage virtually the same sonority is redefined as a 
functional altered dominant, something quite familiar to Schubert, Schumann, and 
others.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
Refer to <b>Example 2</b>. It is not so much that the sounding of B minor in measure 6 
retrospectively defines measure 4 as V/B minor&mdash;although this is significant&mdash;rather, 
gradual transformation of the sonority&rsquo;s role occurs early in the passage when 
the uppermost note in the first chord expresses a common voice-leading technique 
(a 6&#8211;5 linear motion over a stationary bass) as the pitch D moves to the pitch C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
in the course of measures 1&#8211;3.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> But once so altered, the opening sonority is recast in a tonal role and when D 
natural returns in measure 4 it functions within the context of an intensified 
functional dominant harmony, leading (melodically) through an accented passing 
tone, and on to scale degree one of B minor in measure 6. The past emerges from the 
future, or said in a different way the past is culled from an individual&rsquo;s 
memory recalling a bygone era. And as with all such recollections, that which is 
invoked takes shape as an imperfect image of what actually transpired in another 
time, and at another locale.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[13]
The effect of the opening is made all the more powerful by the fact that 
shifting between present and past is a recurring feature of the song, and on 
each occasion is predicated upon a similar connection between textual signal 
words and the move from one tonal syntax to another.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[14]
Another of the three threads from the opening of &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve&#8221; unfolds in similar 
fashion. While the arpeggiated A-flat major chord is a subsidiary event in measures 1&#8211;2, it comes to assume a dominant role in establishing the swerve to A 
major&#8212;the key area that takes hold in measure 18 and beyond. <b>Example 3</b> will 
help to illustrate.</p>

<p>[15]
In stage one of the contextualization 5&#8211;6 technique converts root and fifth of 
the A-flat major chord into root and third of what in stage two becomes the 
functional V<sup>5#</sup> / A major. C is retained as common tone in each of the earlier 
sonorities, but with the tacit understanding that the pitch functions as B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in 
the progression to C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 18. Later in the song (m. 47), the sonority here 
read as altered V/A returns as an augmented chord in the varied repetition of 
the head motive.</p>

<p>[16]
The process outlined above is akin to the earlier move to B minor. But a 
fascinating and edifying progression occurs just in advance of measure 18 and the 
arrival of A major; at the point of maximum dissonance in terms of music <i>and</i> 
poetry (measures 14&#8211;15, repeated in measures 16&#8211;17), allusional reference is made to 
each of the sonorities of measures 1&#8211;2. <b>Example 4</b> will help to illustrate.
The series of augmented chords in measures 14&#8211;17 emerges at the tail end of a 
sequence of descending fifths (measures 10&#8211;14). These same augmented chords either 
replicate, or&#8212;in a manner consistent with Lewin&#8217;s &#8220;law of the nearest way&#8221;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup>&mdash;express slick familial relationships with the three principal sonorities from 
the opening measures of &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve&#8221;; the text in measures 14&#8211;17 is a present tense 
lament of a lost past: &#8220;Maintenant navr&eacute;e, a jamais navr&eacute;e&#8221; [Now regretting, 
forever regretting].</p>

<p>[17]
A corollary to the 6&#8211;5 voice-leading motions expressed at the opening of &#8220;De 
r&ecirc;ve&#8221; effects a link between the song&#8217;s initial and its concluding measures. <b>Example 5</b> reproduces measures 84&#8211;99.
The temporal orientation in the text changes from the immediate present to a 
distant past populated by Grail knights, the latter reflective of the realm 
wherein the protagonist&#8217;s soul ultimately resides; the shift is triggered by 
&#8220;D&#8217;&eacute;tranger soupirs&#8221; [Strange sighs] issuing from an otherworldly &#8220;ancient 
dream.&#8221; This inward turn of emotions is accompanied by the inward resolution of 
the B&#8211;F tritone (registrally accented in the left-hand piano gesture across 
measures 84&#8211;87). F, the later event, slides to F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 88, and B (prolonged in measures 
84&#8211;87) is ultimately transferred into an inner voice, and moves to A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 
88. The tonal focus on F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> major from measure 88 through to the conclusion of the song 
effectively provides another context for the 6&#8211;5 voice leading procedure 
encountered in measures 1&#8211;3 (refer to Example 2), for on <i>textual</i> grounds it is 
plausible to interpret each of the two F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">-major sonorities, the one in measure 3, and 
the one here, as consequent to the antecedent represented by the F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> augmented 
triad in measures 1&#8211;2.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[18]
The foregoing argument is further substantiated from a performance standpoint, 
for it is telling to note that the projection of the three distinct 
accompanimental strata in measures 88&#8211;91 cannot be effected as written: a subtle 
fissure between measures 87&#8211;88 prohibits the lowest of the three stratum from 
operating in sync with the other two, and in a metaphorical sense, the bass line 
remains in the temporal domain of the preceding phrase. It takes pronouncement 
of the textual message in the vocal line following measure 89&#8212;&#8220;Mon &acirc;me c&#8217;est du r&ecirc;ve 
ancient qui t&#8217;&eacute;trient!&#8221; [My soul is of an ancient dream embracing you]&#8212;to 
redress the schism between strata, for once the textual message has been 
uttered, all participants in the setting again operate in the same temporal 
dimension: coming together, as it were, in the world of dream, memory, and 
recollection. In the end the present merges with the past in a reformational 
sense, without ever capitulating to that which cannot be recreated.<p style="text-align: center">

<a name="pourLePiano"></a>[19]
Quite a different sense of recollection is encountered in <i>Pour le piano</i> (1901) 
than is the case in &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve.&#8221; In <i>Pour le piano</i> a historically- and a self-aware 
Debussy<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>  come together and openly engage with earlier traditions through overt 
references to Baroque genres expressed in the titles of each of the Suite&#8217;s 
movements: &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude,&#8221; &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; and &#8220;Toccata.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> What transpires in the work, 
however, is an interrogation of the musical past spawning a present that Debussy 
claims for himself. And in this regard the Suite is manifestly representative of 
Debussy&#8217;s lifelong struggle with that which Harold Bloom, in different contexts, 
has described as the crippling awareness of what it is to be a late-comer&#8212;one 
forced to establish ones own place in history.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[20]
From a musical perspective, engagement with the past begins in the initial 
measures of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude.&#8221; <b>Example 6</b> reproduces the work&#8217;s opening 27 measures.
In the introduction (measures 1&#8211;6 (downbeat)) the melody is in the bass voice, and 
features a descending arpeggiation through the A minor chord: the pitch A at the 
outset giving over to E and C in measure 5, before reaching low A in measure 6. Tonally, 
registrally, and gesturally, this bass-voice melody would not be out of place in 
any number of compositions dating from the 18th century.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> 
The Baroque seal is all 
the more apparent in the descending tetrachord expressed in the bass, where A is 
prolonged in measures 1&#8211;3, G and F in measure 4, and E in measure 5. The complete setting of 
these same measures, however, witnesses Debussy in contact with old-world 
sensibilities in the planing effects (hereafter &#8220;chordal parallelism&#8221;) heard in 
measures 2 and 4, as well as the whole-tone harmonizations entering at the end of measure 
4 and extending through measure 5.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>
	<p>
[21]
The stage, as it were, has been set, and from an aesthetic point of view the 
remainder of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; represents a clever study in the juxtaposition of two 
temporal realities separated by nearly 150 years, for at certain moments one 
reality dominates, while at others the two realities collide: the introduction 
yields to a span of music (measures 6 -10) which is decidedly of an earlier era; but 
as the excerpt in Example 6 continues the present, Debussy&#8217;s present, begins 
more-and-more to assert itself, until the past is modernized to such an extent 
that it no longer holds sway. A telling moment occurs when the perpetual mobile 
of the steady sixteenth-note rhythm is interrupted by silence (on the downbeat 
of measure 26) before heading &#8220;back to the Baroque&#8221; in measure 27.</p>

<p>[22]
I will not provide a catalogue of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8217;s&#8221; gestural affinities with 
various past compositional procedures. Suffice it to say that the events thus 
far encountered are restricted neither to these initial measures, nor to the 
opening movement of the Suite. In point of fact recollection of the past serves 
as a touchstone for the future throughout <i>Pour le piano</i>. <b>Example 7</b> reproduces 
the opening 33 measures of the final movement &#8220;Toccata.&#8221;
Measures 1&#8211;8 subtly juxtapose syntaxes expressive of new and old compositional 
practices. The effect is established in measure 1, where the absence of the pitch E 
casts the first five sixteenth notes in a pentatonic context (the new).<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
But the 
larger sweep of the measure subsumes the pentatonic effect within a diatonic 
framework (the old) predicated upon an initial leap from 
<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> down to
<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> and a 
descending scalar motion from
<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> to
<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>. The alternation between pentatonicism 
and diatonicism is most noticeable in measures 3&#8211;4 and measures 5&#8211;6, but from measure 6 
onward the earlier practice comes to dominate, and at that with Baroque &eacute;lan.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> 
The scene changes abruptly in measures 9&#8211;12, where a modal flavor takes hold, and 
forward motion stalls. In short, measures 9&#8211;12 represent an attempt to establish a 
present from the past. A short-lived Classical-era vignette appears in measures 13&#8211;20. It is based upon a descending major scale featuring a bright tone, and the 
establishment of a light mood&#8212;all of which is supplanted after measure 21, and from 
m. 26 a near daemonic sequential passage takes hold, a passage inconceivable in 
the days of Bach or Beethoven&#8212;or perhaps better, in the days of Couperin or 
Berlioz.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup></p>

[23]
To review, the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; is preludial in its declaration that recollection will 
dominate the compositional landscape of <i>Pour le piano</i>; the &#8220;Toccata,&#8221; too, 
however, measures up to its name, being very much in the nature of an 
improvisation. In many ways, it is the middle-movement &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; that is the 
most difficult to characterize: for although in terms of tempo, rhythmic design, 
and transparency of form the movement is true to the French Baroque conceit that 
a sarabande must emulate a slow menuet, its harmonic palette is more 
consistently <i>progressive</i> than that of either the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; or the &#8220;Toccata.&#8221;

surface-level gestures and voice-leading procedures of the passage are: strongly 
goal oriented toward C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 22; decidedly modal in character; and replete with 
chordal parallelisms. The descending tetrachord in the bass beginning in measure 19 
(C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&#8211;B&#8211;A&#8211;G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">) recalls the similar Baroque thumbprint employed in the 
first-movement &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude,&#8221; as does the bass-line arpeggiation of the tonic chord 
in measures 19&#8211;22 (C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">, downbeat of measure 19, giving over to G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> on the downbeat of measure 
20, with E entering in measure 21, and C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 22).</p>
<p>[25] Recollection, however, saturates the complete passage on another count 
and signals Debussy&rsquo;s grappling with a much more immediate past, for the choice 
of a half-diminished seventh as the movement&rsquo;s initial vertical sonority is 
provocative: without meaning to overstate the issue, marked usage of 
half-diminished seventh sonorities (post 1865) had the potential to invoke 
the ghost of Wagner, and when interrogating Debussy&rsquo;s repertoire, one must 
remain sensitive to the fact that that ghost was never fully exorcised. But a 
single sighting does not an association make, and especially given Debussy&rsquo;s 
complex and shifting attitude toward Wagner.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> 
Yet there are subtle ways in which Wagner, 
if not embraced in the larger scope of <i>Pour le piano</i>, does provide a frame of 
reference for Debussy in his, Debussy&#8217;s, promotion of a personal identity.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p>
	<p>
[26]
I contend that the appearance of half-diminished seventh sonorities at critical 
junctures in the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; is anything but serendipitous. Roy Howat&#8217;s 
observation that the first <i>and</i> second chords in the original version of the 
&#8220;Sarabande&#8221; are Tristan laden helps to substantiate my point, for chord two in 
the earlier version of the piece contains <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> in the place of C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">, and the

<p>[27] Refer again to Example 8, and in particular to the event encountered on 
the downbeat of measure 13. In a Wagnerian context the sonority might well have 
served as pre-dominant harmony in the key of D, for such would be the fate of a 
bona fide Tristan chord with A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
as its bass and C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
as its uppermost note. But the chord on the downbeat of measure 13 does not continue 
to an A7 sonority. Instead, locally, the Debussy harmony is an altered dominant 
progressing to I of D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
for the cadence in measure 14; what is more, the cadence itself qualifies the opening 
measures of the movement, as <b>Example 9</b> will help to illustrate. In the reading, the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> half-diminished seventh sonority of measure 1 is interpreted 
as incipient tonic harmony prefiguring the cadential gesture in measures 13&#8211;14. 
Poetically stated, the initial harmony refuses to function as a Tristan chord 
would: in this case&#8212;given the bass note D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&#8212;as a preparatory event for V / G.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> 
But 
in terms of goal directedness, the opening of the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; is unsettled on 
other counts. The return of the initial half-diminished seventh chord at the end 
of measure 1, coupled with the bass motion by descending perfect fifth (D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&#8211;G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">), is 
suggestive of a G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> phrygian setting. The reading is made problematic, however, 
by the strong-beat incursion of the E major sonority on the downbeat of measure 2, 
which has the effect of <i>separating</i> the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> from the G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">, and thus denies any sense 
of definitive cadence. Further, attention to the motion by parallel tenths 
between the outer voices of measure 1 supports a more tonally focused orientation 
with the E major chord of measure 2 as tonic harmony; that is to say, the chordal 
parallelisms of measure 1 surreptitiously project an extended linearized V6/5 of E, 
which moves to I / E on the downbeat of measure 2.</p>

<p>[28] The point is that ambivalence or even antagonism toward a single governing 
stability is de rigueur from the head of the &#8220;Sarabande.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> 
In fact, the 
suggestion that D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> represents tonic in measure 14 is only true in a fleeting sense, 
for the ultimate function of D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> (and of chordal events predicated upon it) is 
more properly regarded as supertonic of C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&#8212;the goal both of measures 1&#8211;22, and of 
the movement as a whole. This last statement takes on greater significance via 
accrual of the following information: the middleground bass line across measures 1&#8211;14 arpeggiates a G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> minor triad&#8212;G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measures 1&#8211;4 giving over to B in measure 8 and D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
in measure 14.<p>
[29]
Wedged between the tonally schizophrenic &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; and the only slightly more 
stable &#8220;Toccata,&#8221; the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; links the outer movements together by 
redirecting the tonal orientation encountered in the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; toward a 
different ultimate goal at the end of the Suite. All of this is part of a larger 
story, however, for additional inter-connective webs unify the three movements 
of <i>Pour le piano</i> and invoke further Wagnerian recollections in the form of 
veiled allusions.<p>
[30]
The &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; features a conflict between two conventionally related tonal 
centers: A minor and C major. And although A minor ultimately prevails, the 
outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion, as C major remains a prominent 
force in the movement as late as the fourth-to-last measure. Recognition of the 
shifting between A and C in the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude,&#8221; however, is significant with respect 
to Wagnerian recollection as an undercurrent in <i>Pour le piano</i>, for A and C are 
the two tonal regions pitted against one another early on in <i>Tristan und Isolde.</i><sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> 
And yet while at the deepest structural level the tonal struggle in the two 
preludes&#8212;Wagner&#8217;s and Debussy&#8217;s&#8212;is identical, the surface-level gestures of the 
earlier work have little bearing on those of the later: in a word, Debussy 
carefully shrouds the evocation of his precursor. What is more, the shrouding 
itself may well represent a cleansing act.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup></p>

<p>[31]
A significant portion of Debussy&#8217;s &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; is based upon either one or the 
other of the two whole-tone scales (see <b>Example 10</b>).
For instance, measures 57&#8211;96 (or fully one quarter of the movement) derive entirely 
from the whole-tone scales outlined in Examples 10(a) and 10(b).<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> Although 
potentially amorphous events given the regularity of their intervallic 
structuring, Debussy carefully partitions the two scales in ways that allow 
various sonorities to acquire dominant functionality at particular moments over 
the course of the passage. V / A and V / C dominate, underscoring the principal 
keys of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; and maintaining the Wagner-based recollection.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> 
But a vivid reference to another dominant chord exists in the context of the 
whole-tone scale encountered in the passage excerpted in <b>Example 11</b>.
The sonority at the head of the passage carries with it multiple functions: 
locally it represents altered 
<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18">VI of C; when it returns in measure 71 (and following) 
the sonority is increasingly associated with A minor (A flat in the bass 
equaling the enharmonically respelled leading tone of A); a third meaning, 
however, reflects an inter-movemental tonal bond between measures 57&#8211;58 in the 
&#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; and both the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; and the &#8220;Toccata,&#8221; as these two measures of 
the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; forecast C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">, the ultimate key of the later movements, in the guise 
of its V. <b>Example 12</b> models the three progressions in which the 
whole-tone sonority of measures 57&#8211;58 participates, in turn reflecting the move to 
I / C major, I / A minor, and I / C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> minor.</p>

<p>
[32]
Additional Wagnerian recollections exist in <i>Pour le piano</i>, and at that embrace 
both intra- and inter-movemental concerns. Refer to <b>Example 13</b>.
These measures again lay bare the opposition between the principal tonal regions 
of the Suite&#8217;s first movement, but they also serve as a conduit enabling 
communication with significant moments in the <i>Tristan</i> &#8220;Prelude.&#8221; Beginning as a 
repetition of measure 6 and ff., the material in Example 13 initially unfolds in A 
minor. By measure 43, however, A minor has given way to C major. In fact, measures 43&#8211;47 
prolong C by means of an underlying I&#8211;V&#8211;I harmonic progression; and yet 
Debussy&#8217;s distortion of the tonal past is unmistakable in these later measures, 
where whole-tone harmonization of the bass line&#8217;s descending linear tetrachord 
accounts for the vertical events above B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 44, A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in measure 45, and above F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> in 
m. 46 (the latter of which is contextualized as an altered secondary dominant 
chord (V / G)). In fact, both whole-tone scales are in play in measures 43&#8211;47&#8212;the 
consonant skips by perfect 4th in the bass at the end of measures 43, 44, and 45 
reference the two symmetrical scales: C&#8211;B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">&#8211;A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> from the one are coupled with 
G&#8211;F&#8211;E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> from the other.<p>
[33]
In measures 41&#8211;42 Debussy signals that C major is at hand. Prior to measure 41, the 
passage in Example 13 had been a near verbatim repetition of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8217;s&#8221; 
opening&#8212;the ultimate goal of which was the return of A minor in measure 27. But in measure 
41, the direct repetitions of the stepwise ascent from F to B&#8212;linearizing the 
two most active pitches in V<sup>7</sup> of C&#8212;combine with the F major chord articulated on 
each beat in measures 41 and 42, and the appearance of the F major chord is 
illuminating; while containing both A and C, the chord never-the-less <i>separates</i> 
the two principal tonal regions of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude,&#8221; and does so in a manner 
analogous to the procedure employed by Wagner at the first heightened cadential 
moment in <i>Tristan</i>. The reciprocal nature accorded F in the Wagner &#8220;Prelude&#8221; 
(simultaneously VI / A and IV / C) is thus appropriated as part of Debussy&#8217;s 
imaginative space, and made his own in <i>Pour le piano</i>&#8212;in a trenchant sense, 
Wagner is recalled here so as to be surmounted.<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup></p> 

<p>[34]
It is in the light of the triple recollection of Wagner&#8212;in the Teutonic 
composer&#8217;s &#8220;suggestions&#8221; of A minor and C major <i>plus</i> his &#8220;deflective&#8221; F&#8212;that we 
return to the sonority encountered at the opening of the second movement of the 
Suite. I have already established that in an intra-movemental sense the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
half-diminished seventh sonority in measure 1 of the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; carries multiple 
functions, at once: participating in a G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> phrygian modal progression; 
representing incipient tonic chord in D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> major; and serving as pre-dominant 
chord in C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> minor. While perhaps not altogether mutually-exclusive, it is the 
latter of these interpretations that proves to be the more far-reaching with 
respect to the Suite as a whole, for C<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> is the ultimate key in the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; 
and in the ensuing &#8220;Toccata.&#8221; But in typical Debussyan fashion, the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
half-diminished seventh of measure 1 comprises a third and altogether different 
function: it provides a back-reference to the earlier &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude.&#8221; <b>Example 14</b> will help to illustrate.
By juxtaposing the ending of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; and the beginning of the &#8220;Sarabande,&#8221; 
Example 14(a) draws attention to registral connections among contiguous moments 
in the two movements. Such a device frequently appears in Debussy&#8217;s 
multi-movement compositions, and assumes the role of a reinterpretive swerve.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> 
More insightful with respect to the Wagnerian argument, however, is the 
anachronistic join proposed in Example 14(b). In it, the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> half-diminished 
seventh sonority of the opening of the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; is regarded in a manner akin 
to that of an authentic Tristan chord, <i>progressing</i> to the dominant of G in measure 46 
of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude,&#8221; which in its turn moves to V7 and I of C in measure 47.<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[35]
The reading in Example 14(b) is predicated upon the fact that although later in 
terms of its temporal positioning, the D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> half-diminished seventh chord of the 
&#8220;Sarabande&#8221; conceptually precedes that which actually occurs earlier in the 
Suite: motion to the heightened G7 in the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; en route to I / C.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> But more 
significantly, the reading establishes yet another role for the opening of the 
&#8220;Sarabande&#8221;: the movement&#8217;s initial half-diminished seventh chord, pointing 
forward <i>and</i> backward in time, represents a profoundly pivotal moment in 
<i>Pour le 
piano,</i> a moment upon which the whole of the drama turns. And from the vantage 
point of the whole, the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; recalls the past (i.e. the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221;), and 
projects into the future (the &#8220;Toccata&#8221;) in an overt sense via association with 
Baroque genres, and subtly, through the secret nexus of specific Wagnerian 
affiliations. In <i>Pour le piano</i>, then, the distant and the immediate past are 
submerged under the weight of Debussy&#8217;s fashioning of the present.<p style="text-align: center">
***<p>
<a name="golliwog"></a>[36]
A third distinct approach to recollection and its role in positioning the past 
appears in one of Debussy&#8217;s most direct Wagnerian summonings, namely in 
&#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s [sic] Cakewalk,&#8221; the last of the six piano miniatures in Debussy&#8217;s 
1908 collection entitled <i>Children&#8217;s Corner.</i><p>
[37]
At first blush, it may appear as though the central project of &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s 
Cakewalk&#8221; is the intermingling of &#8220;low&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; art-forms within a single 
work&#8212;something quite common in Debussy&#8217;s Paris:<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> the low here derives from the 
use of a dance form associated with ragtime music and early African-American 
culture, and is further reflected in the title&#8217;s reference to a black minstrel 
doll and veritable racist symbol; the high, on the other hand, devolves from the 
parody of what are arguably the most recognizable measures from any of Wagner&#8217;s 
operas&#8212;namely, the opening passage of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> appropriated in the 
middle section of the ABA structure of &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk.&#8221; Were the case to 
be as simple as this, irony might well be deemed the dominant trope for the 
piece, and would contextualize the Wagnerian reference in a satirical light. But 
reflection on the mix of musical detail and extra-musical allusion leads to a 
much bleaker assessment, one with tragedy at its core.<p style="text-align: center">
***<p>
[38]
I must make a digression at this point, for in referring to irony, satire, and 
tragedy (and earlier in the article to metonymy), I am drawing on the work of 
the cultural historian Hayden White (<a href="#white_1973" id="citation_white_1973_67dc9b23c814d">1973</a>) and less directly on that of the 
literary critic Northrop Frye (<a href="#frye_1957" id="citation_frye_1957_67dc9b23c8150">1957</a>). White&#8217;s argument is involved, and runs to 
levels much deeper than it will be necessary to document here. In fact, I rely 
almost entirely upon two exceptional glosses of White in web articles by Joshua 
Walker (2002), and Hans Kellner (<a href="#kellner_1997" id="citation_kellner_1997_67dc9b23c8152">Kellner 1997</a>).<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup><p>
[39]
In Walker&#8217;s words, White&#8217;s starting point is that &#8220;all historical explanations 
are rhetorical and poetic by nature.&#8221; They represent fictions that project 
particular ideological stances (anarchist, radical, conservative, liberal), 
expressed through the choice of certain modes of emplotment adopted in the 
telling of the story (romance, tragedy, comedy, or satire),&nbsp; and are reflective 
of particular apprehensions of historical fields (formist, mechanist, 
organicist, or contextualist), affiliated with one or more of four dominant 
tropes (metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, or irony).<p>
[40]
My concern here is quite limited, for I will only assess aspects of the 
explanatory strategies adopted by a work&#8217;s author&#8212;in this case Debussy&#8212;as a 
means of presenting a premise in the guise of historical fact. A portion of 
Walker&#8217;s summation chart appears below&#8212;the portion concerned with the affinity 
between dominant trope, its function, the
mode of emplotment signified by the use of a particular trope, and the 
associated notion that there is an ideal moment in time where the author 
projects &#8220;all is as it should be.&#8221;<p>

<div style="width:400px;border:none;margin-left:230px">
        <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Chart 1</b>.

<p>[41]
Each of the dominant tropes reflects a particular strategy with respect to the 
relationship of parts to whole. With metaphor, a direct one-to-one connection 
exists between the subject and the object, expressed algebraically as A = B. By 
contrast, metonymy establishes a part-to-whole relationship wherein an attribute 
of the subject is made to stand for the subject itself&#8212;the locus classicus is 
reflected in the statement &#8220;he is all heart.&#8221; From representation (the function 
of metaphor is to represent), metonymy moves to the level of reduction. 
Representation is an unattainable idealization, and thus metaphor must draw upon 
romance as a mode of emplotment while looking toward a past wherein A is <i>said</i> 
truly to have been equal to B&#8212;something that is no longer possible; such 
idealism is anathema in metonymy, which takes as its default tragedy. And yet 
with metonymy, the near future holds promise, for upon its arrival the inherent 
flaws of the past and of the present will be overcome. In the integrative 
function of synecdoche, an external attribute is said to represent the thing 
itself, giving rise to identifications such as &#8220;Whitehouse&#8221; for &#8220;Presidency,&#8221; or 
more playfully, perhaps, &#8220;cheesehead&#8221; for &#8220;Wisconsonite&#8221;&#8212;the latter proposed 
here both to reflect the comic nature of the statement (synechdoche&#8217;s mode of 
emplotment is comedy), and as a means of valorizing the present (the moment in 
time with which the mode is most concerned). By contrast, irony looks to negate 
as a means of transcending that which is other than it could or should be. The 
author&#8217;s adoption of a satirical tone, strategic or otherwise, in part at least 
speaks to the belief that the present holds little promise: nirvana lies out of 
reach in the distant and unforeseeable future.<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup></p>

<p>[42]
Returning to the Debussy let me start by considering the possibility of humor, 
either comical or satirical&#8212;the distinction between the two need not concern us 
for the moment. The very juxtaposition of Wagner, or better, the juxtaposition 
of the aural experience and the visual spectacle encountered at Bayreuth 
(Wagner&#8217;s exclusive shrine to opera), and at the opposite end of the spectrum 
the sights and the sounds of the music hall on a Saturday night, would have 
brought a smile to the face of any number of Debussy&#8217;s contemporaries quick 
enough to catch the association; and the association is unmistakable in 
&#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk.&#8221; But conspicuous in its absence from the middle portion 
of Debussy&#8217;s piano piece&#8212;where the opera&#8217;s initial cello line is clearly placed 
on display&#8212;is an <i>authentic</i> presentation of the very harmony that continues to 
engender much critical thought even today, nearly 150 years after its Wagnerian contextualization: the 
&ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; chord itself.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> 
<b>Example 15</b> reproduces measures 61&#8211;64 of &ldquo;Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk,&rdquo; where Debussy summons 
from memory (viz. recalls) the melody of the opening of Wagner&rsquo;s opera.
A veiled reference to the &#8220;Tristan&#8221; chord is heard in measure 63 of &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s 
Cakewalk,&#8221; beginning with the after-beat accompaniment to the melody of the 
previous measure. But a registral fracture occurs between the tune begun in measure 
61 and the stock-in-trade cakewalk figure of measure 63 (the backdrop for the chord), 
and thus the Wagnerian melody and its principal harmonic affiliate are 
disassociated from one another. What is more, by rearranging the order of 
pitches in the sonority in measure 63 of &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk&#8221; from their canonical 
placement as initially experienced in Wagner&#8217;s opera, Debussy distorts the 
&#8220;Tristan&#8221; chord. In Example 15, for instance, Debussy embeds Wagner&#8217;s bass note 
F in an inner voice. The imperfect recollection of Wagner in the middle portion 
of &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk,&#8221; then, poses as many questions as it answers.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
        <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 16</b>. &#8220;Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk,&#8221; measures 1&#8211;4 and measures 10&#8211;13</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="marion_examples.php?id=18&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 16 thumbnail" src="marion_example16a_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and see the rest)</font></p></div>

<p>[43] A more powerful citation of the &#8220;Tristan&#8221; chord does, however, occur much 
earlier in &#8220;Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk,&#8221; namely, in the very opening measures of the 
work (see <b>Example 16</b>).
The &#8220;Tristan&#8221; chord unfolds a number of times over the course of measures 1&#8211;4, but it 
is projected as a <i>linear</i> event, which is anathema to the sonority&rsquo;s 
initial use at the opening of the opera.<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> 
Beginning in measure 2, left- and right-hand octave doublings cascade downward 
through the four pitches of the &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; chord while bringing about an overall 
crescendo in the dynamic level. In measures 10 and 11 the &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; chord is rendered 
vertically, its natural state from the head of the &ldquo;Prelude&rdquo; (see the boxed 
material in Example 16(b)), and Wagner&rsquo;s bass note F is restored in its proper 
register. It is at the opening of the cakewalk, then, and not in its middle section, that Debussy most closely evokes the memory of his precursor. And yet even here, things are 
veiled, for Debussy&rsquo;s close positioning of the chord places Wagner&rsquo;s upper pitch 
G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> 
in the tenor register. Further, it and Wagner&rsquo;s B natural are enharmonically 
respelled (as A flat and C flat, respectively). Real authenticity, it would 
seem, is just beyond reach.</p>

<p>[44]
And now for the primary point: in each of Examples 16(a) and 16(b), Debussy 
projects the famous Wagnerian gesture as but a component of low art, and at that 
art doubly damned in its affiliation with &#8220;non-Aryan&#8221; and &#8220;non-white&#8221; music. In 
terms of Hayden White&#8217;s trope functions, it is clear that neither representation 
nor integration is at issue: the fracturing between the quotation from the 
opening melody of the opera and the attendant &#8220;Tristan&#8221; chord is too deliberate 
to allow either function to prevail. Romance and comedy, the respective modes of 
emplotment affiliated with representation and integration, are thus not the 
driving forces at work in &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk.&#8221; But what of the remaining 
trope functions, reduction, and the pair negation/transcendence? One could make 
the case for either, for it is tenable to suggest that Debussy&#8217;s distortion of 
Wagner represents satire at its finest, ironically projecting Wagner in a 
context completely foreign to that which Wagner so carefully cultivated for 
himself: negation, then, is invoked in the service of transcendence. And yet the 
flaw in the preceding argument is that such a stance would call upon a degree of 
altruism not readily identifiable with Debussy. Suffice it to say that Debussy 
was not terribly interested in leaving to posterity acknowledgment of his worth. 
In other words, a statement such as &#8220;to the distant future I submit my toils&#8221; is 
out of character for one whose adopted moniker ran &#8220;Claude Debussy, musicien 
fran&ccedil;ais.&#8221; Instead, metonymy seems the most valid of the four dominant tropes in 
&#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk,&#8221; and in support of the claim, we need but turn to an 
extra musical clue provided by the composer himself.</p>

<div style="width:350px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
        <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 3</b>. Debussy&#8217;s Frontispiece for <i>Children&#8217;s Corner</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="marion_examples.php?id=19&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 3 thumbnail" src="marion_fig3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

			<p>[45] As though to underline his condemnation of Wagner, Debussy&rsquo;s 
			own illustration for the frontispiece of the complete collection 
			(i.e. for the original edition of <i>Children&rsquo;s Corner</i>) 
			features, among other things, an Elephant in a winter&rsquo;s 
			scene&mdash;alluding both to &#8220;Jimbo&rsquo;s Lullaby,&#8221; the second of the 
			collection&rsquo;s six pieces, and to &#8220;The Snow is Dancing,&#8221; the fourth of 
			the six (see Figure 3). The elephant holds in its trunk a tether. At 
			the opposite end of the tether is connected a helium-filled balloon, 
			upon which appears the grotesque image of the &#8220;Golliwogg&rsquo;s&#8221; face. At 
			any moment, the balloon, and with it Wagner, will be released to the 
			four winds: to be forgotten in the dismissive sense of the word, and 
			in the process making possible a brighter future, a near future, 
			a future with someone <i>other</i> than Wagner at its center.</p><p>

[46] Were Debussy&#8217;s extra-musical message to be put into words, his statement might 
read &#8220;lamentably, the best that Wagner has to offer is to be dismissed as light, 
black-faced entertainment.&#8221; Taken in such a light the mode of emplotment for 
&#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk&#8221; is tragedy rather than satire. And without meaning to 
place too fine of a point on the matter, here Wagner is associated with a mode 
of past conveyance, given lift by helium or by hot air, while Debussy is the 
vessel ushering in &#8220;the century of aeroplanes,&#8221; the near future with a &#8220;right to 
a music of its own.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup> </p>

<a name="conclusion"></a>[47]
Each of the three works discussed in the article recalls antithetical musical 
practices. In &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve,&#8221; aspects of an outmoded musical language are affiliated 
with dream recollection, where what remains after waking is never wholly 
consistent with respect to the dream, but can be projected accurately enough so 
as to place the image of the thing itself before others. In <i>Pour le piano</i> the 
past, appearing in the guise of Baroque and Classical genres and techniques, is 
initially embraced, later mitigated, and ultimately undone in a process 
remarkable for its kinship with the emergence of self-awareness in developmental 
terms. With &#8220;Golliwogg&#8217;s Cakewalk,&#8221; Debussy&#8217;s evocation, berating, and 
subsequent dismissal of Wagner ultimately releases him, Debussy, from the 
burdens of the past. In all three cases Debussy draws upon various forms of 
recollection in order to bring the past and the present into direct contact, as 
though to supply a musical analogue to the following aphorism: it is only by 
confronting our demons that the cathartic act of their management can commence.</p>

in casting this argument. I must make another point perfectly clear. None of the 
three works is engaged in a comprehensive sense; rather the article is in the 
nature of a position paper, focusing attention on Debussy&rsquo;s intermingling of 
traditional and innovative procedures with a view toward revealing how these 
opposing ideas cooperate within coherent musical structures. The article does 
not purport to be about analysis in the rigorous sense of what that term has 
(rightly) come to mean in our discipline today. Indeed, to the extent that it is 
invoked at all, analysis here is often in the form of score observation, and as 
such would not have been beyond the reach of a Debussy contemporary.<br><a href="#FN2REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN3">3.</a> Numerous sources speak directly to the matter. See, for 
instance, <a href="#kittler_1990" id="citation_kittler_1990_67dc9b23c21ed">Kittler 1990</a>, <a href="#silverman_1989" id="citation_silverman_1989_67dc9b23c21ef">Silverman 1989</a>, <a href="#watson_2000" id="citation_watson_2000_67dc9b23c21f1">Watson 2000</a>, and <a href="#weber_1986" id="citation_weber_1986_67dc9b23c21f3">Weber 1986</a>. An overview 
of the collective consciousness of the era may be gleaned by reading the array

<i>Les Fleurs du mals</i>; Bergson&rsquo;s 1889 <i>Essai sur les donn&eacute;es imm&eacute;diates de la conscience</i> (most often translated as 
<i>Time and Free Will</i>); and Proust&rsquo;s multivolume <i>A la recherche du temps perdu,</i> (In Search of Lost Time), written over a 14-year period beginning in 1909. A discussion of the paradox of time in 
<i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> Paris is central to <a href="#marder_2001" id="citation_marder_2001_67dc9b23c21f7">Marder 2001</a>. <a href="#galison_2003" id="citation_galison_2003_67dc9b23c21f8">Galison 2003</a> argues the

the novelties of cinematography, see <a href="#leydon_2001" id="citation_leydon_2001_67dc9b23c21fc">Leydon 2001</a>, who argues that several 
compositional techniques encountered in Debussy&rsquo;s later works find parallels in 
those of the burgeoning film industry in France (including his approach to 
form).<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> <a href="#debussy_1977" id="citation_debussy_1977_67dc9b23c21fe">Debussy 1977</a>, 297.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> In this matter Debussy, of course, was neither first nor 
alone. Wagner, for one, tackled the temporal and the spatial in his operas 
dating at least from <i>Tristan</i> onward. Further, Wagner&rsquo;s sphere of influence extended widely, taking in not only Debussy, but also such divergent artists as Chabrier, Mahler, Strauss and Faur&eacute;, and subsequent generations beginning with Schoenberg, Webern, 
Berg, and notably Stravinsky. An associative net thus captured many, and 
<a href="#mcfarland_2005" id="citation_mcfarland_2005_67dc9b23c21ff">McFarland 2005</a> goes as far as to connect Debussy directly with members of the

uneven, and yet it clearly reflects the symbolist influence of Baudelaire in such works as his 
<i>Les Fleurs du Mal</i> (1857); see especially the text of Debussy&rsquo;s &#8220;De fleurs&#8221; 
[sic], the third of the cycle&rsquo;s four pieces.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> I wish to thank Amy Phelps and Downing Thomas for 
helpful suggestions in my translation of the poem.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> The stance I adopt here reads the functional role 
given to the augmented and other highly chromatic sonorities throughout &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve&#8221; as something unavailable in earlier eras&mdash;in grammatical and syntactical senses alike. These sonorities are thus temporally orienting events, idiomatically calling attention to the present rather than the past. Other interpretations are equally valid, of course. <a href="#hepokoski_1984" id="citation_hepokoski_1984_67dc9b23c2208">Hepokoski 1984</a> hears similar materials in Debussy as instances of timelessness, with artistic/religious overtones, whereas <a href="#forte_1991" id="citation_forte_1991_67dc9b23c2209">Forte 1991</a> favors the metaphor of indeterminacy with respect to Debussy&rsquo;s non-tonal spaces.

In <i>Pour le piano</i> Debussy&rsquo;s progression is the antithesis of Wagner&rsquo;s in that there is a temporal disruption (Debussy&rsquo;s half-diminished seventh sonority is heard 
<i>later</i> in the piece than is its attendant dominant); the dominant of G is 
itself altered, being inverted and with A# displacing the diatonic chordal fifth 
(A natural); and finally, Debussy extends the progression beyond the dominant of 
G (i.e. beyond the very point where Wagner would have left off).<br><a href="#FN42REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN43">43.</a> The reading, then, valorizes Kramer&rsquo;s notion (<a href="#kramer_1988" id="citation_kramer_1988_67dc9b23c2243">1988</a>, 47) of &#8220;multiply-directed linear time,&#8221; where the realization of some significant implication in a work and the implication itself are separated from one another.

metamorphoses that are controlled neither by causal mechanisms nor by free 
decisions&#8221; (p. 38). Greene&rsquo;s term here is &#8220;gradual transformation.&#8221; In fact, the 
claim that &#8220;change is presented . . . as the outgrowth of the past,&#8221; (p. 38) 
goes a long way in accounting for the juxtaposition of radically different 
vocabularies at the level of the surface in Debussy&rsquo;s music. Shifts from tonal 
to modal passages, from pentatonic to octatonic or diatonic, and so forth, are 
frequently presented in an abrupt fashion that is nevertheless perceived as

At the heart of the matter was a widespread commitment to expunge from Gallic soil excesses associated with 19th-century Germanic art. An intense period of introspection ensued, the

<i>locus classicus</i> for an intense exploration of Bloom&#8217;s theories and the means by which their application comes to animate deep inter-compositional associations among response and source works. Korsyn 1996 provides a vivid account of Brahms&#8217;s Op. 88 and Chopin&#8217;s Op. 38 along these lines.  The article engages in an intertextual reading that by degrees reveals the means by which the later work (and by association its composer, Brahms) becomes &#8220;original by resisting [the] influence&#8221; (p. 56) exerted by the earlier work (and hence by Chopin himself).</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">New, that is, with respect to western European practice.

See, for instance, <a href="#abbate_1981" id="citation_abbate_1981_67dc9b23c222e">Abbate 1981</a>, <a href="#holloway_1979" id="citation_holloway_1979_67dc9b23c222f">Holloway 1979</a>, and more recently <a href="#donnellon_2003" id="citation_donnellon_2003_67dc9b23c2231">Donnellon 2003</a>, and <a href="#devoto_2004" id="citation_devoto_2004_67dc9b23c2232">DeVoto 2004</a>, to cite but four sources. Equally, documentary evidence concerning Debussy&rsquo;s verbal response to Wagner exists in countless of his private correspondences and published writings. I will be returning to the theme of Wagner in Debussy in the final portion of the article, where &#8220;Golliwogg&rsquo;s Cakewalk&#8221; is set on display. On the topic of post-Wagnerian employment of half-diminished seventh chords, see <a href="#rothgeb_1995" id="citation_rothgeb_1995_67dc9b23c2234">Rothgeb 1995</a>. My use of the label &#8220;half-diminished seventh sonority&#8221; is intended mainly as an expedient, and is meant to draw attention to a familiar sound. The particular sonority encountered on the downbeat of measure 1 in the &#8220;Serenade&#8221; carries numerous functional associations in the course of <i>Pour le piano</i>, 
as we shall soon discover.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#watkins_1988" id="citation_watkins_1988_67dc9b23c2236">Watkins 1988</a>, 70&#8211;71 and <a href="#messing_1988" id="citation_messing_1988_67dc9b23c2238">Messing 1988</a>, 39&#8211;58 compare 
aspects of Satie&rsquo;s <i>Premi&egrave;re sarabande</i> (1887) and the 1894 original version of 
Debussy&rsquo;s &#8220;Sarabande.&#8221; Messing goes on to compare gestural affinities in works 
by Debussy and Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Debussy and Delibes, as well as Debussy and Rameau, Debussy and Couperin, and Debussy and Janequin. Watkins and Messing both argue that by 
<i>avoiding</i> reference to German compositional procedures, the scrutinized 
works deliberately sever the bond with Wagner. And yet the case might not be as 
simple as it first appears to be.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#howat_1985" id="citation_howat_1985_67dc9b23c2239">Howat 1985</a>, XVII&ndash;XVIII, and XX&ndash;XXI lays out the compositional history of the &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; in some detail. In addition to the back-to-back half-diminished sevenths in measure 1, the third chord in the 1894 &#8220;Sarabande&#8221; (written seven years before the Suite&rsquo;s publication in 1901) contains a D natural in the place of the D 
in the parallel location in the Suite. The aural effect in the 1894 &#8220;Sarabande,&#8221; 
then, is decidedly peculiar: that which runs amok of the modal flavor of the 
opening in the original version of the work severely impedes its forward motion.</div><div id="fndiv34" class="flyoverdiv">The case for the Wagnerian reading of chord one will 
come into sharper relief as my dialogue continues. For now, suffice it to say 
that that reading involves inter-movement connections.</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">And the point is further driven home by the marked 
conflict between notated and perceived rhythm across the entire 22-measure 
excerpt. In a word, Debussy&rsquo;s barring is not consistently true to the metric 
flow of the passage.</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#bailey_1985" id="citation_bailey_1985_67dc9b23c223b">Bailey 1985</a>, refers to the coupling of A and C in 
Wagner&rsquo;s &#8220;Prelude&#8221; as an instance of the &#8220;double-tonic complex&#8221; prevalent, to 
Bailey&rsquo;s way of thinking, in the works of certain Germanic composers of the 
later-Romantic era.</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">Detailed pursuit of this line of reasoning would lead 
through Harold Bloom&rsquo;s anxiety of influence. And while I will not engage with <i>Pour le piano</i> from a Bloomian perspective, the piece might just represent a perfect testing ground for assessing the degree to which Debussy devises an 
<i>agon</i> with Wagner that unfolds along the lines of Bloom&rsquo;s six revisionary ratios. See, again, pioneering works by <a href="#korsyn_1991" id="citation_korsyn_1991_67dc9b23c223d">Korsyn 1991</a>, and <a href="#straus_1990" id="citation_straus_1990_67dc9b23c223e">Straus 1990</a> in the application of Bloom&rsquo;s theories to music.</div><div id="fndiv38" class="flyoverdiv">The whole-tone scales of Examples 10(a) and 10(b) make 
their first appearance in measures 4&#8211;5 of the &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude.&#8221;</div><div id="fndiv39" class="flyoverdiv">In &#8220;De r&ecirc;ve,&#8221; the alternation of whole-tone and 
diatonic tonal materials was read as marking the move from one temporal domain 
to another. Here whole-tone passages enhance rather than replace 
dominant-to-tonic and other common-practice harmonic progressions.</div><div id="fndiv40" class="flyoverdiv">It is worth noting that the F major chord in the 
cadenza toward the conclusion of Debussy&rsquo;s &#8220;Pr&eacute;lude&#8221; (measure 149) functions in 
exactly the same way: as VI / A and IV / C. Furthermore, in the final six 
measures of the movement the dominant chords of A, of C, and of F appear in turn 
in the service of a rich modally-infused cadence in A minor.</div><div id="fndiv41" class="flyoverdiv">See, for instance, the end of &#8220;Brouillards&#8221; and the 
opening of &#8220;Feuilles mortes&#8221; in book two of <i>Les pr&eacute;ludes.</i> That 
join raises the following critical question: where does the one piece actually 
end and the other begin?</div><div id="fndiv42" class="flyoverdiv">With respect to my earlier allusion to Bloom&rsquo;s revisionary ratios, the progression outlined in Example 14(b) carries semblances of &#8220;tessera,&#8221; the second of Bloom&rsquo;s six ratios. In tessera, the later poet projects the original work in the negative light of not having gone far enough, and takes an antithetical position with respect to the original work in order metaphorically to complete it [<a href="#bloom_1973" id="citation_bloom_1973_67dc9b23c2240">Bloom 1973</a>, 49&#8211;76]. In <i>Pour le piano</i> Debussy&rsquo;s progression is the antithesis of Wagner&rsquo;s in that there is a temporal disruption (Debussy&rsquo;s half-diminished seventh sonority is heard 
<i>later</i> in the piece than is its attendant dominant); the dominant of G is 
itself altered, being inverted and with A# displacing the diatonic chordal fifth 
(A natural); and finally, Debussy extends the progression beyond the dominant of 
G (i.e. beyond the very point where Wagner would have left off).</div><div id="fndiv43" class="flyoverdiv">The reading, then, valorizes Kramer&rsquo;s notion (<a href="#kramer_1988" id="citation_kramer_1988_67dc9b23c2243">1988</a>, 47) of &#8220;multiply-directed linear time,&#8221; where the realization of some significant implication in a work and the implication itself are separated from one another. Noncontiguity 
is a necessary condition of multiply-directed linear time, for &#8220;to have a truly 
multiply-directed music, linear processes need to be interrupted and completed 
later (or earlier!) [in the work].&#8221; In this regard, see, too, <a href="#marion_2001" id="citation_marion_2001_67dc9b23c2245">Marion 2001</a>.</div><div id="fndiv44" class="flyoverdiv">Watkins 1994 provides a thorough examination of the
