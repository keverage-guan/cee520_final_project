<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1]   Everyone in this room has probably either heard or performed
the piano classic popularly known as &ldquo;Chopsticks.&rdquo;  Here&rsquo;s a question
for you then:  Why is Chopsticks so fun to play?  And here are a few
answers.  Let&rsquo;s start with one that does not involve a close reading of
&ldquo;the music itself&rdquo;.  For instance, let&rsquo;s start with the title and its
implications.  Guess what:  the fun we have with Chopsticks is not as
innocent as we might have imagined.  The title perhaps implies that
the piece could be played with chopsticks, that its blankly primitive
repetitions are to be associated with what a Westerner might
ethnocentrically think of as blankly primitive tableware.  And thus a
seemingly innocuous bit of piano play could be interpreted as
invoking anti-Asian prejudices so thoroughly ingrained in our
American culture that they are imbibed in the very first organized
polyphony we generally learn to produce on the piano.  An
investigation of Chopsticks in this vein would reveal sinister forces
pulling at our fingers, making sure we in fact <i>enjoy</i> the work of
stereotype and subjugation, such that it becomes a form of play<nobr>. . . </nobr>We
could then broaden the context of this interpretation by playing
figuratively on the fundamental black-and-whiteness of the
keyboard, invoking the degraded histories of ivory and slavery,
latent horrors waiting to be uncovered in the family piano.
Remember, for instance, that Chopsticks stays on the white keys and
celebrates (enforces?) Western diatonic tonality, while that old
pentatonic ditty&mdash;rival to Chopsticks among the piano&rsquo;s young
proteges&mdash;is primitively played with a rolling fist on the black keys.
(And this is all in a day&rsquo;s work at the old piano, sounding board of
upper middle class American family values<nobr>. . .)</nobr>
<p>

[2]    But this sort of a reading, which in more capable hands than my
own might indeed become a soaringly imaginative reading of
Chopsticks and the cultural matrix that sustains it (I&rsquo;m imagining
something like a Friedrich Kittler treatment of this<nobr>. . . ),</nobr> will probably
not satisfy a &ldquo;music theorist,&rdquo; however much it might engage a
&ldquo;Theorist&rdquo; with a capital T (i.e a critical Theorist). It has been said of
music theorists that when given the cue to dance to this newer,
headier capital-T theory, they will more than likely beg off.  If we
are going to understand these &ldquo;wallflowers&rdquo; and how they too might
be understood as dancers, we need to try on another answer to our
question about Chopsticks.
<p>

[3]     So here&rsquo;s another kind of answer.  Why is it so fun to play
Chopsticks?  Because we get to perform a fundamentally satisfying
procedure of tonal music:  we get to produce a dissonant sound and
then resolve it to a consonant sound.  More specifically, we perform
an unprepared version of the 2&ndash;3 suspension, the so-called bass
suspension, so called, in fact, because the bass itself is compelled to
resolve.  This is a particularly vivid suspension, and at the keyboard
we itch to resolve it, to feel it.  In the same way, many musicians&rsquo;
hands will twitch at an imaginary keyboard when they are thinking
about musical processes.  There is a distinctly tangible mind-body
connection here&mdash;I would go so far as to claim that it can be a source
of pleasure to demonstrate theoretical prototypes such as
suspensions.  (Think of the zeal with which many theorists bang out
examples on the piano&mdash;and I have even heard [and used] the
dismissive phrase &ldquo;He plays like a theorist.&rdquo;)
<p>

[4]    Such are the pleasures of the theory pedagogue&mdash;but just who
are these characters who indulge themselves so oddly?  Many of us
probably think of music theorists as those impossible upstarts who
actually enjoyed freshman and sophomore theory classes, classes
generally agreed to be the bane of most students of music
performance and history.  Amid the general distress before a
dreaded dictation exam, future theorists could be seen practically
sharpening their pencils with their teeth in their eagerness to get
started.   Much could be made of the anxiety this would engender
among the rest of the classmates; it may in fact be at the root of a
good deal of what continues to make us uncomfortable in this field.
Part of our general anxiety is surely caught up in a notion of music as
an invisible art whose traces can perhaps be sensed with precision
only by a certain few&mdash;by those with &ldquo;good ears.&rdquo;  Many were
shamed by these &ldquo;good ears&rdquo; in freshman theory and are now
spending the rest of their careers convincing themselves that the
&ldquo;chosen few&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t really hearing the music after all, but are just
transcribing it, like so many court stenographers<nobr>. . .</nobr>
<p>

[5]     Now most of us, theorists or not, have received such training at
one point or another.  Quite a few musicologists I know are as adept
as any theorist in the aural gymnastics we often honor with the term
&ldquo;musicianship.&rdquo;  But on the other, more fruitful, side of such
compulsory exertions stands the enhanced ability to create
normative musical utterances in various styles, to sharpen one&rsquo;s ears
in such a way as to be able first to parrot a style and then to express
oneself in it.
<p>

[6]    In fact, I would argue that our training as musicians encourages
us to treat music as something like a language with its own claims:
an &ldquo;as if&rdquo; notion of autonomy is an indispensable corollary to the act
of learning to use this language.  For the study of music often takes
on the self-sufficiency and absorbing intensity of a game:  we learn
rules, protocols, calculated risks&mdash;all of which can be negotiated with
a limited intervention of verbal language.  Thus music is treated as a
language that needs to be learned, a language that prosecutes its own
claims&mdash;and we learn to deal with those claims.  They become an
inescapable part of the way we think in and through music. <p>

[7]     Let&rsquo;s return to the joys of the 2&ndash;3 suspension, in order to
develop a concrete instance of the way theorists (and the rest of us)
tend to generalize about music&rsquo;s materiality.  How is the 2&ndash;3
suspension generally used? We might think of it as something like a
figure of speech, a special device with rhetorical possibilities, one
that invokes a sense of urgency, a distinct need to progress.  It is in
fact a great way to get a harmonic progression off the ground, i.e. off
of the opening tonic&mdash;for the bass itself is compelled to move, and
when bass lines move, things happen.
<p>
<blockquote>
	Taped ex.:  Bach Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1, C-major
	Prelude, bars 1&ndash;4
</blockquote><p>

Or, more dramatically:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Taped ex.:  Haydn, Symphony No. 45, &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; 1st
	movement, bars 1&ndash;8
</blockquote><p>

More dramatic still is the use of an unprepared second in the bass (as
in Chopsticks); starting a piece in this manner is very striking indeed:
<p>

<blockquote>	Taped ex.:  Beethoven, Overture to Creatures of Prometheus,
	opening
</blockquote><p>

Or think of the culminating moments of the sixth movement of the
Brahms Requiem, where the words &ldquo;Death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hell&rdquo; are given
harmonies featuring an unprepared 2nd over the bass:
<p>
<blockquote>
	Taped ex.:  Brahms Requiem, VI, bars 178&ndash;186
</blockquote><p>

This passage leads to what is undoubtedly the denouement of the
entire piece:  after one of the most stunning enharmonic moments in
all of Western music, in which an A-flat from the minor side of C is
transmuted to a G-sharp that leads, via an applied dominant (a V7/vi
magically eliding to a ii7), to C major (on the words &ldquo;Wo [wo, wo] ist
dein Sieg&rdquo;), those unsettling dissonant seconds over the bass on
&ldquo;Death&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hell&rdquo; are assimilated and normalized as chord sevenths
and/or suspensions over the bass in the four-square cadential
progression that follows:
<p>

<blockquote>	Taped ex.:  Brahms Requiem, VI, bars 178&ndash;208
</blockquote><p>

Brahms&rsquo; use of dissonance here perfectly mirrors a complex
psychological state, as terror and fear in the face of death give way
to a surge of resilient faith, a breakthrough moment that is awful and
awesome in its unforgettable merger of paralyzing horror and the
empowering presence of the sublime, sounding the paradox of how
we are sometimes at our highest when at our lowest.
<p>

[8]    &mdash;So&mdash;to come way back down to earth: this business of making
the bass unsteady and imperiled can be very vividly dramatic;
metaphorically speaking, the very ground beneath us seems to move,
and <i>we are compelled to react.</i> This is something Chopsticks can be
said to share with the Brahms Requiem.<p>

[9]     Of course, despite our appropriation of examples like these, in
music as in counterpoint studies the 2&ndash;3 suspension is not simply a
device&mdash;we don&rsquo;t just grab a 2&ndash;3 off the shelf like a fan belt; it is
rather a result of complex contextual considerations.  But it does
retain an identity apart from its multifarious contexts, a
generalizable identity.  As theorists, we are admittedly interested in
this class of phenomena, in which the prototypical utterance is also a
concrete example of the class.  This is a point worth elaborating.
<p>

[10]     Allan Keiler&rsquo;s work repeatedly and brilliantly addresses the
very interesting problem of the metalinguistic properties of music.
What this means, in a nutshell, is that music can act, viably, as a
description of itself.  This is as true in the case of Rameau&rsquo;s
fundamental bass as it is in that of Schenker&rsquo;s voice-leading graphs.
In the work of both of these theorists, abstract prototypes also
behave as actual musical utterances.  Now this is true, to an extent,
with language as well.  Any descriptive statement about sentence
structure, if performed in the verbal medium, is a metalinguistic act
that uses language to speak about itself.  This kind of reflexivity has
been around for quite some time with us humans&mdash;it is in fact as old
as consciousness itself.
<p>

[11]     But there is a crucial difference that obtains between music
and language in this regard.  In verbal metalanguage, descriptive
prose is distanced from the thing described.  In musical
metalanguage, a prototype such as the 2&ndash;3 is not only a general
descriptive model, it functions itself as an exemplification of the
class.  The thing doing the describing is also the thing described.   As
such, this &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; prototype is at the same time palpable and
concrete.  Our recourse to such a palpable prototype facilitates the
type of thinking that we have characterized as invoking the &ldquo;music
itself.&rdquo;  It encourages the notion that music is about itself.
<p>

[12]     This is to say that we understand a  2&ndash;3 suspension in some
tangible yet internalized way <i>before</i> we enlist it as evidence in an
interpretive or analytical act.  All interpretive work surrounding
music relies on cliches about its materiality, cliches that are effective
and unquestioned precisely because of this process of internalization.
As Charles Rosen recently put it:  &ldquo;All analyses, technical as well as
ideological, are controlled by our knowledge and experience of the
traditional metaphors in the history of music, the conventions of
meaning that have been given to the grammar and syntax of music.&rdquo;
<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  Take the example of tonic confirmation.  There&rsquo;s plenty of tonic
confirmation in Beethoven&mdash;of that there is no argument; what we
tend to argue about is whether or not such confirmation represents
something positive (the affirmation of a self) or something negative
(the suppression of an other).  But perhaps we should ask why no
one questions the notion of tonic confirmation.  Why do we feel&mdash;in
Beethoven, as in most tonal music&mdash;that a key center is ultimately
established in such a fashion that we can use the word &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo;
without squirming?
<p>

[13]     Our fundamental relation to the materiality of music&mdash;i.e. the
things we all agree on&mdash;forms the one aspect of our sense of music
that it rarely occurs to us to examine.  And yet it is here that we
might come closest to the mechanism by which music matters to us,
how it gets under our skins, in our bones, and how it works there as
the soundtrack to our most cherished mythologies of self.  Music
theorists in particular make <i>this</i> sense of music intellectually
explicit because it is explicit for them&mdash;everything they have taken
most closely to heart is a result of actually playing music, of handling
the goods.  (That they do not go far enough in acknowledging all the
ramifications of this state of affairs is a point to which I will return a
little later.)  To wrap up this present train of thought, then:  our
shared sense of &ldquo;the music itself,&rdquo; which many theorists continue to
choose to make explicit, can be said to result from the nature of our
training as practicing musicians, and from the way we tend to
generalize about music, with palpable, internalized prototypes.
<p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Part II</b></p>

<p>[14]   The literary critic Peter Brooks worries that recent literary
studies are &ldquo;constantly trumping the aesthetic by the ideological and
the political&mdash;making the aesthetic simply a mask for the ideological<nobr>. . .</nobr>
[Such studies thus risk] losing a sense of the functional role played
by the aesthetic within human existence.&rdquo;  He continues:  &ldquo;What is
more difficult for students<nobr> . . . </nobr>is to slow up the work of interpretation,
the attempt to turn the text into some other discourse or system, and
to consider it [instead] as a manifestation of the conventions,
constraints, and possibilities of literature.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[15]    We, too, need to do this more difficult thing, to slow up the
work of interpretation&mdash;to ask not only what a musical text means
but how it means.  This is not to say that we should henceforth cease
considering music as capable of speaking of things outside itself. But
I would submit that if we wish to grant music the power to speak of
other things, we inherently need to understand music as music, as an
autonomous voice:  we couldn&rsquo;t reasonably expect something without
its own voice to comment on anything&mdash;something without its own
voice would at best be a mouthpiece for something else.  Or, as Pieter
van den Toorn has it: if we don&rsquo;t credit music with an ability to
&ldquo;speak to some degree for itself, musical structures are not more but
less free, less able to stand apart from the<nobr> . . . </nobr>materially purposeful.&rdquo;
<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  The case for music&rsquo;s autonomy is not simply the default result of
its lack of definable moorings in the world of referential denotation;
rather, any claim about music meaning something presupposes that
it has its own voice.  In short, precisely because music is musical it
can speak to us of things that are not strictly musical.  This is how we
hear music speak:  not by reducing it to some other set of
circumstances but by allowing it the opacity of its own voice, and
then engaging that voice in ways that reflect both its presence and
our own, much as we allow others a voice when we converse with
them.
<p>

[16]     Music theory explicitly concerns itself with that voice but
clearly needs to do more in terms of linking the nature of that voice
to general human values.  It needs to broaden its engagement with
music.  For something like a guild mentality has arisen in the theory
community, with the result that theorists are perceived as self-willed
musical insiders, as a privileged priesthood, keepers of music&rsquo;s voice,
that most incorporeal of relics.  The continuing disdain for music
theory is thus easy to understand, and our recently won ability to
engage with music professionally and academically, without having
to do it in the pre-ordained ways of &ldquo;music theory and analysis,&rdquo; has
been tremendously liberating and exhilarating, almost akin to
escaping the walls of academia.  Addressing music as part of one&rsquo;s
vital intellectual, political, and personal concerns really makes music
speak one&rsquo;s own language.
<p>

[17]    Now the most devastating aspect of this reaction to music
theory and analysis is not the claim that it is ideologically
malodorous but rather the growing perception that it is simply no
longer interesting.  One of the more common complaints on the
ideological front has been that music theory courts too much
abstraction.  And yet it is not the level of abstraction that is now felt
to be tedious (and besides, there&rsquo;s abstraction aplenty in any
theoretical/academic enterprise&mdash;abstraction is the hot air that fills
our balloons; without it, we would all collapse into the pragmatic
gravity of civilian reality).  No, it&rsquo;s not abstraction that bores but
rather all that heavy concretion&mdash;all the relentless details in any
closely argued musical analysis, like so much jungle undergrowth to
be &ldquo;macheted&rdquo; through in order to obtain a few insights that one can
take back home.  Few of us feel we have the time or inclination for
such &ldquo;close reading.&rdquo;
<p>

[18]     But in the end, like anything else truly worth cultivating,
knowing music takes time, and your average theorist is someone who
has taken the time to learn music as a functional language.  Imagine
practicing the criticism of English poetry if you yourself could not
automatically form meaningful utterances in the English language!
Now I know of some superb functional musicians who happen to be
theorists and who, on account of the present climate in our field, are
now feeling professionally disenfranchised.  Can we really afford to
usher these &ldquo;insiders&rdquo; and what they know of music out of our
professional discourse, hoping they will confine themselves to the
theory classroom (where, as shapers of many of our unquestioned
assumptions about music, they will ironically continue to exercise
deeper influence than any of the rest of us)?
<p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Part III</b></p>

<p>[19]    Much of the present standoff between theory and new
musicology is due to the ways in which academic areas develop and
become empowered.  Patrick McCreless has written a wonderfully
informed essay on the way music theory has secured power in
academia, and much of the iconoclastic energy (not to mention new
found power) of so-called &ldquo;new musicology&rdquo; is of course a natural
reaction to the perceived power of music theory.  And yet New
Musicology and contemporary music theory do not form a binary
opposition.  For we have not even begun to abandon our shared
assumptions about musical materiality&mdash;about the nature of tonality,
melody, motivic relations, etc.  We all share the tendency to think in
terms of palpable musical prototypes; it&rsquo;s part of the way we relate
to music in academia.  But this is starting to sound like a &ldquo;Theorists R
Us&rdquo; kind of argument, as if we are all theorists by default, and that
might make many of you wince&mdash;for you may well feel that Theory
would surely be a fate worse than<nobr> . . . </nobr>Musicology.  So let&rsquo;s play it safe
and simply say that, along with their common assumptions,
contemporary theorists and new musicologists share common
concerns, and they (<i>we</i>) can learn from each other.
<p>

[20]     So what can music theory learn from new musicology?
Theory too can dare to subvert and/or critique the prevailing
intellectual models (and some theorists are already doing this&mdash;Brian
Hyer, David Cohen, and Kevin Korsyn come to mind as thinkers who
are bringing poststructural sensibility and competence to the act of
theorizing about music).  The study of the history of music theory
also provides a rich field of shared concerns:  what could be more
propos than the history of our intellectual assumptions about music?
In this work, theory could stand to harness some of the interpretive
energy and sparkle of New Musicology&mdash;and indeed it has begun to
do so (Cambridge Press&rsquo;s forthcoming collection of essays, edited by
Ian Bent and entitled <i>Music Theory in the Age of Romanticism</i>,
attests to this).
<p>

[21]     But even more fundamental than these methodological
rapprochements is a central and shared task:  we can explore
together our assumptions about music&rsquo;s materiality.  This is a
question about <i>us</i>, after all&mdash;what we value in music, what music
means for us (not narrowly, in the referential or even connotative
sense, but broadly, in the sense of why music matters at all).
Generally speaking, theorists, who work explicitly with the
materiality of music, do not often attach those concerns to
meaningful and relevant human values, and critics, who often work
explicitly with such values, do not bother to acknowledge their
assumptions about music&rsquo;s materiality.  Among other things, this
type of shared exploration would involve a shift to the role of the
body, for this is at the heart of my concern about palpable
prototypes and the pleasures of music theory.  (And I should
mention here the work of Lawrence Zbikowski and Janna Saslaw,
theorists who are interested in conceptual models of music that
metaphorically invoke the body.)  Cultivating this mind-body
connection may bring us close to the secret of music&rsquo;s power:
perhaps we would find that music is the art form that most
successfully models the human integration of mind and body.
<p>

[22]     In short (and in conclusion), we have a lot to learn from each
other, a lot of work to do:  theorists can work on their myopia, new
musicologists on their astigmatism.  And we all have one big thing to
unlearn:  namely, our mutual disdain.  In the words of the late, great
novelist Stanley Elkin:  &ldquo;Listen, disdain is easy, a mug&rsquo;s game, but
look closely at anything and it&rsquo;ll break your heart.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m not sure we
need to break our hearts over each other, but it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to
soften them, to remember that we all, at one time or another, have
had pleasurable recourse to the claims of &ldquo;the music itself&rdquo;; we have
all enjoyed playing Chopsticks.</p>
