<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Roger Scruton&rsquo;s Aesthetics of Music is a smart, witty, and eloquent book, full of
passionate and persuasive argument. An articulate conservative political philosopher
closely associated with Margaret Thatcher, Scruton is also an amateur composer, who
obviously cares deeply about music and is much concerned with diagnosing the reasons for
the decline of musical culture in recent years. Scruton&rsquo;s aesthetics draws heavily
on German idealism, which he couples with a thorough knowledge of analytic philosophy and
a surprisingly firm grasp of contemporary music theory (Schenker, Lerdahl and Jackendoff).
 The result is a rare thing: a book on music aesthetics where both philosophical and
musical issues are handled deftly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>[2] Following the tradition of idealist aesthetics, Scruton grounds his thinking about

music on a distinction between sound and tone. Without tone, he says, music cannot
exist. Tone, moreover, cannot be reduced to sound; instead tone arises from
something we hear in sound when we hear it as music. &ldquo;A tone is a sound which
exists within a musical &lsquo;field of force.&rsquo; This field of force is something we hear,
when hearing tones&rdquo; (page 17). Scruton is surely correct to emphasize that music,
unlike sound, is an &ldquo;intentional object of musical perception&rdquo; (page 78). 
Consequently when discussing music, we must, Scruton argues, be careful not to commit the
error of mistaking sound for music, that is, the material substrate for the ideal object,
even though the temptation will be great given the material substantiality of sound.
&ldquo;When we hear music, we do not hear sound only; we hear something in sound, something
which moves with a force of its own&rdquo; (pages 19&ndash;20). What precisely is this something?</p>

<p>[3] Tone, according to Scruton, is wholly the product of imagination; it seems to
occupy a place in some imaginary musical space. Tone is not material, then, but
idea. Scruton argues that precisely when we must imagine a representational excess
over the material world, &ldquo;metaphors seem indispensable <nobr>. . .</nobr> because we are using
them to describe something other than the material world; in particular because we are
attempting to describe how the world seems, from the point of view of active
imagination&rdquo; (page 91). The experience of sound as music depends radically on our
imagining the sound as something other than mere sound. &ldquo;Perception is a
natural epistemological power of the organism, which depends on no social context for its
exercise. The musical experience, however, is not merely perceptual. It is
founded in metaphor, arising when unreal movement is heard in imaginary space. Such
an experience occurs only within a musical culture, in which traditions of performance and
listening shape our expectations&rdquo; (page 239). Metaphor is essential rather than
contingent to musical experience, for it is the means of discursively mapping an imaginary
musical space. The metaphor cannot be eliminated because music is not a natural
type, not wholly contained in the material object. &ldquo;The indispensable metaphor
occurs when the way the world seems depends upon an imaginative involvement with it,
rather than on our ordinary cognitive goals. And this is the case when we listen to
music&rdquo; (page 92). Music then is something radically human, &ldquo;the intentional
object of an experience that only rational beings can have&rdquo; (page 96). Sound
itself is always marked by a deficiency that only the metaphors of music can redeem.
 &ldquo;It is true that the terms used to describe music refer to material sounds.
 But they refer to them under a description that no material sound can satisfy.
 Sounds do not move as music moves<nobr>. . .</nobr> Nor are they organized in a spatial
way, nor do they rise and fall. Yet this is how we hear them when we hear them as
music&rdquo; (page 93). This means that &ldquo;metaphor cannot be eliminated from the
description of music, because it defines the intentional object of the musical
experience. Take the metaphor away, and you cease to describe the experience of
music&rdquo; (page 92).  Consequently, forging metaphorical descriptions of music is
never an extra-musical activity but a fundamental aspect of understanding sound as music:
without metaphor there can be no musical descriptions but only descriptions of
sound. &ldquo;Metaphor,&rdquo; Scruton insists, &ldquo;describes exactly what we hear,
when we hear sounds as music&rdquo; (page 96).</p>

<p>[4] The central metaphor for describing our experience of music, Scruton argues, is
tonality. Tonality is the name we give the fictional world of music, the
metaphorical order we hear in sound when we hear sound as music. One reason the metaphors
of tonality are so crucial, Scruton says, is that they permit us to experience music
spatially. &ldquo;Tonal harmony enables us to hear simultaneous musical events as
similar or varied; as moving together through a common intentional space; as creating
tension and resolution, attraction and repulsion; as answering, commenting upon, and
questioning each other; as moving with the force and logic of gestures which are mutually
aware, and mutually accommodating. Triadic tonality is not a system of conventions,
arbitrarily devised and imposed by fiat; it is the life-giving air which the voices
breathe, and through which they move in dance-like discipline&rdquo; (page 271). 
Tonality permits us to experience music as a &ldquo;journey through tonal space&rdquo; (page
286). Music that lacks tonality, he says, also lacks the &ldquo;paradigm of musical
organization&rdquo; that is tonality. Non-tonal music, in other words, suffers from a
poverty of organizing metaphors, and Scruton holds this lack more responsible for the
difficulties nontonal music has had in finding and sustaining an audience than anything in
the actual sound of the music. Moreover, he notes that &ldquo;attempts to depart from
tonality, or to discard it entirely, seem only to confirm its authority over the musical
ear&rdquo; (page 239). To the extent that nontonal music remains indebted to tonal
metaphors, its organization will seem anti-tonal, that is, a nihilistic negation of
tonality, whose impulses will continue to be acutely felt as tonal absences.</p>

<p>[5] Scruton directs his critique of nontonal music primarily against serialism, which,
he says, determines the sonic order of pitches rather than the musical order of tones.
 Serialism, in other words, orders sound rather than tones, which means that
serialism is fundamentally incapable of displacing the centrality of the tonal metaphor.
 Serialism in this view becomes a kind of musical utopia that cannot succeed because
in its enthusiasm to order the material properties of sound, it forgets about tone, which
consequently has only an accidental appearance in the music. What is heard in a serial
piece, Scruton asserts, is often anything but the serial organization. Serial music
often &ldquo;[elicits] the ghost of tonal order&rdquo; (page 296), and we are often
&ldquo;hearing against the intellectual structure, and incorporating what we hear into
tonal or quasi-tonal categories&rdquo; (page 94). Scruton is no doubt correct that the serial
organization is often of little apparent musical import, though he perhaps indicts
serialism too quickly on this count. For Scruton, the lack of connection between
musical and intellectual organization of serial music counts as a fatal flaw because it
suggests that serialism&rsquo;s utopian project, a complete transformation of musical listening,
has failed. &ldquo;The purpose of serial organization was precisely to replace the
order of tonality with an order which, by treating the twelve tones permutationally, would
confer equality on each of them. In other words, it was to endow the musical surface with
a new heard order.&rdquo; (page 296). But this statement of the utopian intentions of
nontonal composition is not quite persuasive, for it ignores the crucial critical function
of this utopia as an image of the not-yet, of what might be otherwise.  Equally
plausibly, it could be asserted that the purpose of serial organization was not so much to
assert a novel organization of the musical surface as to endow the musical surface with a
systemic resistance to tonal order. When Boulez polemically declared that Schoenberg
was dead, he did not emphasize the extension of serial procedures as opening up a new
order of hearing. Rather he argued that total serialism offered a means to avoid
uncritically reproducing and affirming the old musical order. Boulez, in other words,
conceived total serialism as the ultimate extension of the critique of tonality that
Schoenberg had, in Boulez&rsquo;s opinion, rather too timidly initiated.</p>

<p>[6] By withholding the organizing metaphors tonality grants to music, nontonal music
registers a self-reflective ambivalence toward images of social order implicit in
tonality. Scruton, too, unwittingly concurs with this line of argument: &ldquo;Atonal
music in the theatre expresses states of mind that are always partly negative: every
lyrical passage is shot through with anxiety; each loving gesture is also a gesture of
betrayal; there is no affirmation of life that does not mask a will to destroy it. 
It as though anxiety were programmed into this music and can never be wholly
eliminated&rdquo; (page 306). What Scruton especially disproves is the ambivalence, the
lack of clear affirmation. Nontonal musics asks, as it were, whether social order is
possible without coercion. Unlike tonality, which calls forth an image of social harmony,
as though it were actually present in the world, nontonal music does not affirm this
image. In this way, nontonal music understood as a critique of tonality reveals a
moment of ideological delusion in tonality, that is, tonality as false utopia. 
Scruton cannot acknowledge this possibility except obliquely, when he hears in Berg or
Stravinsky, for instance, &ldquo;a reading of serialism against itself, so that each
harmony and motif contains a kind of pointer towards a distant tonal center&rdquo; (page
307). Even in these instances he transmutes this effective serialism into a kind of
nostalgia for a lost tonal order rather than interpreting it as a more determined critique
of tonal thinking. Yet such music gains its musical power precisely through a
critical orientation toward tonality, not because it returns to tonality nostalgically and
unproblematically.</p>

<p>[7] If Scruton remains unconvinced by the product of nontonal composition, he finds the
products of mass culture equally troubling, and he directs especially nasty barbs at REM,
Nirvana, and heavy metal. Repeating a tired motif of cultural criticism, he
ridicules the substitution of rhythm by beat in popular music and bemoans the
&ldquo;decline of popular culture&rdquo; (page 157), which he understands as having devolved
from the cheerfulness of jazz at the beginning of the century to the nihilistic despair of
heavy metal and grunge today. &ldquo;Music soothes, cheers, pacifies; it threatens
the power of the monsters, who live by violence and lawlessness. Those lonely,
antinomian beings are astounded by music, which speaks of another order of being<nobr>. . .</nobr> It is
this very order that is threatened by the monsters of popular culture. Much modern
pop is cheerless, and meant to be cheerless. But much of it is also a kind of negation of
music, a dehumanizing of the spirit of song&rdquo; (page 504). Such complaints about
popular culture are not confined to political conservatives, of course, and Scruton is
aware that his perspective on mass culture is not far removed from Adorno, from whom he
remains curiously anxious to distance himself. Thus, Scruton claims a qualitative
difference between Adorno&rsquo;s mass culture and the mass culture of today and detects
&ldquo;something hasty and undiscriminating in [Adorno&rsquo;s] dismissal of an entire
subculture, as though we could not distinguish the cheerful and life-enhancing sound of
Louis Armstrong from the monsters of Heavy Metal&rdquo; (page 480). Yet Scruton too
hardly prove capable of making distinctions in mass culture today&mdash;it is all
&ldquo;sentimental and idolatrous&rdquo; (page 506).</p>

<p>[8] Scruton is more convincing when attempting to refute &ldquo;the idea of mass culture
as a &lsquo;bourgeois&rsquo; product, and of modernism as the only available answer to it&rdquo; (page
469). His intriguing thesis here is that mass culture is not the product of the
bourgeoisie but of democratic culture. &ldquo;If you ask yourself seriously, when the
transformation of popular music began, the answer would surely be in the twentieth
century, with the reduction of the jazz and blues tradition to a set of repeatable melodic
and harmonic formulae, held together by a continuous &lsquo;beat.&rsquo; This was not a
bourgeois phenomenon at all, and had less to do with the triumph of capitalism than with
the triumph of democracy&rdquo; (pages 469&ndash;70). Scruton, as usual, draws too fine a
distinction here, for it is simply implausible that &ldquo;the masses themselves produced
this music&rdquo; (page 470), as if the productive capacities paid for by the bourgeoisie
played no mediating role in the shift to a consumer-oriented culture. Without the
phonograph, radio, film and, later, television&mdash;all reproductive technologies requiring
capital investment far beyond the means (and so control) of the masses, no matter what the
extent of their representation within the images&mdash;mass culture could not exist. And one of
the characteristics of mass reproductive media is that they supply not only a product but
also help create demand for it. &ldquo;Spontaneous&rdquo; artistic production does not
generally occur in mass culture because there is simply too much money at stake. The
maxim of the swing band&mdash;no practicing on the bandstand&mdash;is the general condition of
cultural production in the era of mechanical reproduction.</p>

<p>[9] Still, Scruton is correct to emphasize the impact that the &ldquo;collapse of
bourgeois culture&rdquo; (page 470) and its replacement by &ldquo;democratic culture&rdquo;
have had on musical life in the present century. And Scruton, no less than Adorno,
is forced into cultural retreat if not actual hibernation in the face of consumer
capitalism. &ldquo;High culture,&rdquo; Scruton writes, &ldquo;is now the province of a
minority,&rdquo; as if this has not always been the case; &ldquo;those with ears must guard
them from the white noise of modern life; and exercise them only in private, or among
those like-minded listeners whom they encounter in the concert hall&rdquo; (page 470). 
Culture, Scruton argues, is in decline because the bourgeoisie are in decline. 
&ldquo;It is only in certain cultural conditions&mdash;those which the bourgeois order most
readily promotes, by promoting the prosperity which is the root of leisure&mdash;that this
flowering of the aesthetic impulse can occur&rdquo; (page 478). Scruton&rsquo;s nostalgia for
the old cultural order blocks critical reflection on it, something Adorno, for all his
hostility toward mass culture and his reverence for traditional bourgeois culture, never
forgets: namely, what are the conditions of possibility of leisure time? Or, to put
it more bluntly, Who pays for it?</p>

<p>[10] Yet it is more productive to read Scruton charitably here as trying to open a
space between the two dominant elements of modernist culture, and, to his great credit, he
struggles mightily against a mandarin impulse to write off all of democratic culture.
 Mass culture in his view is essentially a product of American cultural hegemony.
 Consequently, he is inclined to treat it as a somewhat unruly step-child of
European bourgeois culture. The category of taste serves to distinguish these cultures:
&ldquo;Democratic culture presses us to accept every taste that does no obvious damage.
 A teacher who criticizes the music of his pupils, or who tries to cultivate, in the
place of it, a love for the classics, will be attacked as &lsquo;judgmental.&rsquo; In matters
of aesthetic taste, no adverse judgement is permitted, save judgement of the adverse
judge. This attitude has helped America to survive and flourish in a world of
change. An aristocratic culture has an instinctive aversion to what is vulgar,
sentimental, or commonplace; not so a democratic culture, which sacrifices good taste to
popularity, and places no obstacles whatsoever before the ordinary citizen in his quest
for a taste of his own&rdquo; (page 497). Although his sympathies clearly lie on the
side of bourgeois, aristocratic taste, Scruton does occasionally describe democratic
culture in almost heroic terms, as the triumph of freedom, though his celebratory tone in
such instances is always tempered: democratic freedom is not a freedom he himself can
fully embrace, nor really even comprehend: &ldquo;What I have described is not the
decadence of popular music, but its final freedom&mdash;its breaking-loose from the channel of
taste, into the great ocean of equality, where the writ of taste no longer runs. The
postmodern world denatures music only because it denatures everything, in order that each
individual might have his chance to buy and sell. Popular music ceases to be music,
just as sexual love ceases to be love: nothing less than this is required by the new form
of life&mdash;the fear, inadequacy, and anger that attend the attempt to live without the
blessing of the dead&mdash;is itself expressed by the popular culture and reabsorbed by it.
 The cheerlessness of so much pop music is therapeutic: an acknowledgement that we
live outside society, that we too, in granting equality to every human type, have become
monsters, and that a monster is an OK thing to be&rdquo; (pages 504&ndash;5). Scruton, of course,
cannot sustain this thought and I suspect he stated it even here with tongue placed firmly
in cheek. For Scruton&rsquo;s larger purpose is to fight for the soul of American culture,
to instill in it an image of culture as something better than what is, and to promote
taste as something worth having. This goal helps make sense of the strange ending of
the book where instead of resolution we find a piling up of difficult problems that follow
from the collapse of high modernist culture.</p>

<p>[11] The difficulty of Scruton&rsquo;s conclusion can perhaps be best seen in his discussion
of sentimentality. Sentimentality, he writes, &ldquo;is a vice. Not only does
it place someone at a distance from reality; it also involves an overvaluation of the self
at the cost of others. The other person enters the orbit of the sentimentalist as an
excuse for emotion, rather than an object of it. The other is deprived of his
objectivity as a person, and absorbed into the subjectivity of the sentimentalist. 
The other becomes, in a very real sense, a means to emotion, rather than an end in
himself&rdquo; (page 486). The problem with sentimentality, then, is that it
instrumentalizes the other. To his credit, Scruton realizes that popular and high
art are both often sentimental. &ldquo;We are all to some extent
sentimentalists&rdquo; (page 488). Sentimentality in Scruton&rsquo;s reading turns out to be a kind
of defense against the (post)modern world. It allows us to surmount intractable
difficulties by saying: &ldquo;let us pretend&rdquo; (page 488). Yet his account of
sentimentality leaves him in something of a quandary. On the one hand, he cannot
really wish directly for the restoration of bourgeois culture without lapsing into
sentimental nostalgia for the lost order. But on the other hand, he cannot endorse
the &ldquo;faint sarcastic smile&rdquo; (page 492), the cynical reason, the return to
&ldquo;&lsquo;tonality&rsquo; in inverted commas&rdquo; (page 490) in neo-romanticism because in the
awareness that comes with quotation, a crucial element of innocence is lost. 
Composition in inverted commas, he says, instrumentalizes emotion, becomes another
instantiation of sentimentality. Tonality is no longer possible when it is heard as
&ldquo;tonality.&rdquo; &ldquo;The fact that an innocent stance towards the world is
unavailable, makes music uncomposable. That which music expresses has gone from the world;
and so music too must go&rdquo; (page 491). Scruton attributes this &ldquo;death&rdquo;
of music to the triumph of democratic culture and the leveling of taste that goes with it,
but it is equally possible that such loss of faith, as it might be called, has as much to
do with a general reflection of democratic culture on its own conditions of possibility.
 &ldquo;Tonality&rdquo; registers, as it were, the necessity and impossibility of our
experience of the modern world: that we must negotiate that world using organizing
metaphors that we know at some level to be ideologically suspect and false, but that also
remain useful and at some level even indispensable.</p>

<p>[12] Scruton, however, can see only how the pragmatism of democratic culture
instrumentalizes musical thought and erodes standards of judgment and taste, so he holds
out hope that a new bourgeoisie will emerge that will be able to &ldquo;restore&rdquo; tonal
thinking without instrumentalization, sentimentality, or nostalgia. He claims to
detect signs that &ldquo;a new bourgeois order is emerging&mdash;one which does not feel the
force of modernism&rsquo;s bleak alternatives. It is a fragile audience: its ears muddied
by pop music, its body starved of rhythm, its soul untutored in religious hope. Yet
it has encountered the old musical culture and been inspired by it&rdquo; (page 507). 
It would be easy to ridicule this thought as the feeble hope of a profoundly conservative
and nostalgic man&mdash;whatever this &ldquo;new bourgeois&rdquo; audience may be it is clearly
happier in a Broadway theater listening to the insipid melodies of Andrew Lloyd Weber than
in the concert hall&mdash;but I find it is more productive to interpret Scruton&rsquo;s statement as
expressing a genuine desire to see democratic culture transcend itself, to become
something more than what it currently is.</p>

<p>[13] This brings me to a final point and that has to do with the critical
interpretation of music, something about which Scruton offers many important insights.
 While Scruton is largely dismissive of authors such as Adorno and McClary who seek
among other things to understand the way ideology becomes manifest as music, their
complaints against the narrowness and the illusion of &ldquo;value-free&rdquo; analysis are
largely accepted by Scruton. Indeed, for Scruton, hearing music as music requires the
&ldquo;background assumption&rdquo; of musical value. Consequently, Scruton has as
little patience for a &ldquo;value-free&rdquo; analysis of music as has Adorno or McClary:
&ldquo;A willed neutrality is a kind of judgement, and critics with a political judgement
are rightly suspicious of scholarship which forbids us to ask the pressing
questions&mdash;questions concerning meaning and value&mdash;which trouble our listening
habits&rdquo; (page 365). Like Adorno or McClary, Scruton pushes description into
evaluation, suggesting that the language with which we describe music cannot be separated
from our evaluation of it because the whole point of musical description is to get the
reader to hear the music as the author does. &ldquo;Aesthetic description is an immovable
part of critical practice, and can be distinguished from aesthetic evaluation only with
difficulty, and only at the risk of isolating the evaluative judgement and emptying it of
content. The good critic is not the one who ranks works of music in an order of
merit, or assigns credit marks to each, but the one who alters our perception of the thing
we hear, so as to persuade us of his judgement&rdquo; (pages 372&ndash;3). In terms of
analysis, Scruton recommends seeking out not deep structures, which explain surface
structures, but latent structures, which actually form part of the surface. Such
structures, Scruton argues, &ldquo;are structures we can be brought to hear in the surface,
as we broaden our musical understanding, and begin to notice relations that are more
subtle than those which immediately strike the ear. An analysis of latent structure
is also a piece of music criticism. For it aims to bring into salience what is
important in the music, and to lead us to hear with greater understanding. It
effects an adjustment in the intentional object&mdash;and could indeed be compared to the work
of psychoanalysis, in bringing into consciousness the full matter of the musical
response&rdquo; (page 425). The convergence between critics such as Adorno or McClary, whose
politics he despises, and his own position, is nowhere stronger than in his attempt to
sharpen the critical dimension of analysis: &ldquo;Analysis makes sense, therefore,
only as a prelude to criticism. Criticism begins and ends in an elaborate act of
ostention. The critic asks us to notice certain things, and to hear them
differently&rdquo; (page 428). Ideological critics, Scruton says, act responsibly to
the extent that they seek to transform our hearing, to the extent that they make us hear
differently rather than simply imposing an ideological reading on the material whether it
fits or not. Yet Scruton&rsquo;s complaint really amounts to nothing more than pointing
out that poor ideological criticism exists&mdash;certainly nothing to be surprised about.</p>

<p>[14] Scruton also raises a more substantial claim against ideological criticism, that
it presumes &ldquo;an untenable theory of history&rdquo; (page 430), namely, Marxism. 
While Scruton is certainly justified in pursuing this argument, he conveniently uses it as
cover for the fact that his own conservative theory of history is hardly more
tenable. If Scruton finds Marxian accounts of history implausible, as having
been left in the dustbin of history, then it is also true that his own ideologically
conservative historiography is equally bankrupt. What then are we to make of this
situation? A pervasive skepticism towards the ultimate truth of the large organizing
metanarratives that drive thought defines the peculiar quality of the postmodern
condition, a kind of living in quotation marks: it is difficult to accept any grand theory
as anything more than a working hypothesis that is evaluated pragmatically, less in terms
of its general truth than in the particular insights that it allows. If Scruton
stands on no firmer intellectual ground than those he labels Marxists, then this perhaps
accounts for why the careful reasoning and measured tone he otherwise employs in the book
always gives way to invective whenever he confronts political criticism with which he
disagrees. &ldquo;Some of &lsquo;culture&rsquo; is the unintended by-product of social order; but
much of it, including art, is freely intended. And that which is freely intended is
always more than ideology, even if it is also ideology. A work of art may express
and endorse the social conditions which gave rise to it; but it may also question
them&rdquo; (page 430). Few ideological critics would disagree with Scruton&rsquo;s truism so
far as it goes, certainly not Adorno, the implied target. Indeed, the idea of a
critical function for art, the questioning of social conditions through artistic autonomy,
is at the heart of Adorno&rsquo;s defense of great art. But Scruton continues: 
&ldquo;and if it is a great work of art, it will transcend [the social conditions] entirely
to see into the human heart. Its meaning as ideology may be what interests us least,
when we see it as a work of art&rdquo; (page 430). Even granting that ideology is
indeed what interests us least when we hear music as music, it might still prove
instructive to inquire into this disinterest&mdash;its conditions of possibility, say&mdash;to
understand how music can be heard as music in the first place, and to measure the social
interest of hearing with disinterest. Art, too, bears a social cost. Leisure,
as Scruton knows, lies near the heart of the matter, but he remains blind to the full
ramifications of the category, in particular, that the distribution of leisure time is not
equitable.</p>

<p>[15] Here, then, we return to Scruton&rsquo;s initial premise, the division of tone and
sound, which had at first seemed so plausible and intuitively correct. In fact, this
division is not so innocent, which does not mean that we can do without it. While
problematic, the premise remains absolutely indispensable. Scruton is certainly
right that music does not exist without tone; when we listen to sound as music, we all
necessarily become idealists. Yet just because we must hear tone in sound if we are
to hear sound as music does not mean that we should take the separation of sound and tone
as an unproblematic given. Instead, the aesthetics of music needs to be pushed to
self-reflection on the point so that the irreducible idealism of hearing music in sound is
disenchanted. With self-reflection, idealism turns into its opposite, revealing the
social conditions that sustain it, indeed that make it possible in the first place.</p>
