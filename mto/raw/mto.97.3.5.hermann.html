<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section1"><b>1. Introduction</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[1.1] In this volume, Georgina Born shows ambitious intellectual reach and 
breathtaking cultural scope in the analysis of a narrow topic.  Her tools 
of analysis span many disciplines, and her list of acknowledgments to 
consulted scholars extends to slightly over two pages. This is a huge and 
somewhat sprawling book that practically necessitates reviews by a 
multitude of scholars; indeed, the scholarly community will need several 
reviews to reach an evaluation of sufficient interdisciplinary range and 
depth. I shall limit this review to an exposition of the book&rsquo;s general 
aims and organization, and focus specifically on issues relating to music 
theory and composition. Even so, the issues and the ground covered require 
a somewhat lengthy review.
</p>  
 
<p>[1.2] The scope of the book makes it difficult to summarize its general 
aims. Nor does the eleven page introduction help much: in addition to 
listing the intended audience and the author&rsquo;s qualifications, it is thick 
with various kinds of statements of purpose. Unfortunately, it is not 
clear what priorities our author has for these purposes; thus, I will 
summarize what I take to be the most important of these goals. 
</p>  
 
<p>[1.3] One of the most important aims seems to be Born&rsquo;s ethnographic study 
of IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique), a 
computer music research center funded by the French government. IRCAM is 
located in Paris and was founded and initially led by the highly regarded 
composer/conductor Pierre Boulez. This ethnographic study is set against a 
discursive characterization of modernism and postmodernism in music. Born 
asserts that the musical avant-garde, a species of musical modernism, is 
in crisis: it is no longer marginal and critical of the dominant order, 
but still promotes a view of history in which the present state augurs 
yet a better musical future through technology. The avant-garde has, thus, 
lost its original legitimacy&mdash;and hence must in her view&mdash;search for a new 
raison d&rsquo;etre: the means and methods needed to attract a large audience. 
Born sets out to examine how her claims about the musical avant-garde are 
manifest at IRCAM. In this examination she borrows concepts from the 
fields of anthropology, ethnomusicology, sociology, art history, semiotics,  
and psychoanalysis.  Using techniques of reflexive postmodern 
anthropology, Born studies and critiques forms of power and forms of 
society and culture that have not yet been so analyzed;  IRCAM and Boulez 
are the guinea pigs featured and at times submerged in this  
interdisciplinary stew.  
</p> 
 
<p>[1.4] This is a participant-observer study: Born took the three-month 
instructional program called &ldquo;the stage&rdquo; for visiting composers, and 
stayed on site for a year (page 8). She made efforts to avoid the appearance 
of being co-opted by the institutional elites (page 9) and spent time with 
each sociological subgroup (page 8). And she continued to keep in contact 
with a variety of people within the institution over an approximately ten 
year span (page 8). Born addresses the issues of scholarly objectivity as 
follows:</p> 

<blockquote>
    &ldquo;I stress above all the historicity and the socioculturally sited 
    character of my own interpretations.  But this does not amount to 
    a surrender of any claims to approaching objectivity or imply that 
    the status of my discourse is no different from that of the 
    subjects whom I have studied.&rdquo;  She further states:  &ldquo;If in the 
    course of this book I make a critical analysis of IRCAM as a 
    high-cultural institution and of its cultural forms, this is not 
    with the intention of initiating a relativizing exercise.  The 
    existence of other cultural orders of value and complexity I take 
    for granted,<nobr> . . . </nobr>Nor should the study be read as a masked 
    critique of all forms of subsidized culture; nor finally, does it 
    have a hidden agenda of vindicating postmodernism or the 
    neoliberal promotion of market forces in culture&rdquo; (page 10). 
 </blockquote> 

<p>[1.5] The first two chapters provide necessary background for exposing the 
problems (as she perceives them) that faced IRCAM under Boulez&rsquo;s 
leadership. Chapters three and four provide background information on the 
creation, culture, organization, and status of IRCAM. Chapter five traces 
the internal politics, power relations, and conflicts that naturally arise 
in any institution. Chapter six covers concepts and relations between and 
of repertoires consisting of an IRCAM fostered and approved body of 
twentieth century music called the &ldquo;canon&rdquo; and other musics of this 
century. (See page 173 for a listing of the &ldquo;canonic&rdquo; composers.) IRCAM&rsquo;s 
canon, shaped in large part by Boulez, is read as supporting IRCAM&rsquo;s 
aesthetic position, a variant of &ldquo;modernism.&rdquo; Chapter seven focuses on 
IRCAM&rsquo;s scientific research programs on music perception, computer music 
software and hardware creation, and their interactions with on-site 
compositional theory and practice. Chapter eight concerns the quite 
serious problems encountered by a prominent composer in his visit to IRCAM 
where he was to fulfill a commission from that institution. He was in 
residence and given significant access to the unique resources available 
only at that institution, such as technical staff, software, and hardware. 
The last three chapters explore what Born considers to be system-wide 
problems of IRCAM under Boulez&rsquo;s leadership, and they also provide 
conclusions. Chapters four through ten constitute the ethnography of IRCAM 
(page 11).  
</p> 
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section2"><b>2. The &ldquo;crisis of high art music,&rdquo; IRCAM, and the &ldquo;binary opposition&rdquo; model 
</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[2.1] Born&rsquo;s argument (and perhaps justification) for IRCAM&rsquo;s existence is 
to some extent dependent upon the thesis that &ldquo;high-art&rdquo; music is in a 
state of crisis: &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>many composers who have experienced a 
disenchantment with the high-modernist project and with the perceived 
failures of serialism.&rdquo; The sense of threat to the continued existence of 
western art music has, despite certain differences, been widespread in 
both Europe and the United States (page 3). Boulez&rsquo;s writings for IRCAM 
proclaim that composers and scientists would open a dialog that would 
&ldquo;forge a kind of common language that scarcely exists at present&rdquo; (page 1).  
The creation of IRCAM with the appointment of Boulez as the founding 
director can be understood as a kind of &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; response to this 
crisis. 
</p> 
 
<p>[2.2] This response, however, places young American computer 
scientists&mdash;needed for technical expertise to build and run IRCAM&mdash;and 
American composers born since World War II and working within IRCAM in 
various official and unofficial capacities&mdash;in aesthetic conflict with the 
French director&rsquo;s (Boulez&rsquo;s) aesthetics.  
</p> 
 
<p>[2.3] Another conflict also appears at IRCAM. Born cites Pierre Bourdieu&rsquo;s 
two forms of cultural power: one, economic capital, that is based upon 
economic forces; and the other, cultural capital, which is born of 
cultural and intellectual forces. The latter is the avant-garde cultural 
strategy. Born writes: 
</p>
 
<blockquote>
    Bourdieu implies that the the avant-garde cultural strategy is 
    simply a different form of economic calculation, so that long-term 
    cultural investment may reap even greater economic reward than 
    mundane short-term calculation.  More often, Bourdieu argues that 
    economic and cultural capital are incommensurable and antagonistic 
    spheres, embodied, for example, in the very different lifestyles 
    of the two fractions of the dominant class<nobr> . . . </nobr> Overall, he 
    [Bourdieu] leaves some uncertainty as to whether cultural capital 
    is &ldquo;really&rdquo; convertible into the economic<nobr> . . . </nobr> (page 27). 
</blockquote> 
 
 
<p>[2.4] Certainly, other traditional kinds of conflict between social 
sub-groups within IRCAM occur; these give rise to the principal 
binary pairings of conflict that inform Born&rsquo;s analysis. Born uses both 
&ldquo;hard&rdquo; statistical and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; interview techniques in arriving at her 
results. Her conflict pairings can be summarized with opposing concepts 
that are separated by a slash: modernism/postmodernism; elitist 
canon/&ldquo;other&rdquo; excluded repertoires (popular music, folk music, etc.); 
cultural capital/economic capital; Americans/French;  
scientists/musicians; men/women; producers (scientists and 
composers)/reproducers (technicians, staff, and administrators); composed 
music/improvised music; high tech (e.g. mainframe computers)/low tech 
(e.g. Apple microcomputers); composers/&ldquo;tutors&rdquo; (technicians who make it 
possible for visiting composers to use the in-house technology); secure in 
employment/insecure in employment; and well paid/poorly paid. Some of 
these &ldquo;binaries&rdquo; appear at times with a medial position between them. 
Born also at times combines two of these in order to produce a 
combinatorial design which is then used to locate the various people in 
bi-dimensional &ldquo;pecking orders.&rdquo; These reveal how power and influence are 
distributed within IRCAM (pages 134, 136, 1 37, 280).  
</p> 
 
<p>[2.5] Given the complex multi-dimensional grid of conflict-types that Born 
exposes in IRCAM, the question arises as to how it could function at all.  
Indeed, at times it did not function well; the case of the visiting 
composer that Born documents in chapter eight is an egregious failure by 
many (but not all) standards of measure. In Born&rsquo;s analysis, the stress of 
these multiple areas of conflict upon workers within IRCAM is dealt with 
by the psychoanalytic concept of &ldquo;splitting,&rdquo; an unconscious process 
considered by Melanie Klein to be one of the most primitive defenses 
against anxiety. Splitting involves a distortion whereby the &ldquo;object&rdquo; (of 
perception) is experienced as split into a &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; object, which 
are both absolutely separate yet antagonistically bound. The good object 
is idealized, granted supreme and unquestionable legitimacy, and felt to 
be a refuge from persecution, while the bad object is denigrated as 
worthless, but also as a destructive and terrifying persecutor (page 37).

<p>[3.1] The terms &ldquo;modernism,&rdquo; &ldquo;avant-garde&rdquo; (a type of modernism), and 
&ldquo;post-modernism&rdquo; figure largely in Born&rsquo;s discourse. They are involved in 
describing the &ldquo;legitimization&rdquo; of IRCAM and a prime source of 
conflict within the institution. These terms form the crucial debate on 
what will be the &ldquo;cultural capital&rdquo; a la Bourdieu. Thus, they also feature 
as engines driving Born&rsquo;s study itself. As these terms have received 
multiple definitions in literature, it is helpful that Born provides us 
with salient features of what she believes to be the differences in music 
between modernism and postmodernism. They are presented as binary 
oppositions. Her Figure I, &ldquo;The antagonistic counterpoint of musical 
modernism and postmodernism&rdquo; (page 63) is reproduced below.

<p>[3.2] The concepts embedded within this figure are worth examining in 
detail because so much of the book appears to rest upon them. As many of 
these issues continue to appear in the literature, I hope that an 
examination of each &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; will be of use and interest to the 
non-specialist: I ask for the indulgence of composers and those who 
specialize in this century. Thus, let us consider in turn some problems 
with each of these binaries.
</p>   
 
<p>[3.3] Born, surpringly, does not clearly define determinism. However, a  
definition of determinism found in a dictionary of philosophy starts out  
like this: &ldquo;Determinism: (lat. de + terminus, end) The doctrine that every  
fact in the universe is guided entirely by law (<a href="#runes_1960" id="citation_runes_1960_67dc9bb378bee">Runes 1960</a>, 78).&rdquo; Yet the vast 
majority of modernist composers never embraced &ldquo;total serialism&rdquo;&mdash;the 
closest attempt in music to determinism&mdash;and even the few who briefly did 
try it (such as Boulez) rejected it immediately.  Babbitt, a quite important 
figure in total serialism, wrote pieces setting texts (for example, Philomel, 
with text by John Hollander) that were not deterministic; thus, the 
resulting work itself could also not be. Therefore, the binary opposition  
between modernism and postmodernism fails. 
</p> 
 
<p>[3.4] The next opposition, &ldquo;rationalism&rdquo; versus &ldquo;irrationalism, mysticism&rdquo;  
also fails in that Schoenberg, the arch-modernist, was deeply interested 
in religious mysticism and numerology. He was not alone among modernists 
in this regard: Dane Rudhyar and Alban Berg quickly come to mind here.  
</p> 

<p>[3.5] &ldquo;Scientism, universalism&rdquo; versus &ldquo;sociopoliticization&rdquo; are not true 
binary oppositions&mdash;nor are they necessarily &ldquo;antagonistic.&rdquo;  Neither side 
of this &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; are new to musical discourse. In the mid and late 
18th-century, Jean-Philippe Rameau attempted to use acoustics and 
mathematical concepts to provide a scientific basis for his universal 
theory of harmony (<a href="#christensen_1993" id="citation_christensen_1993_67dc9bb378bf2">Christensen 1993</a>). He kept a steady correspondence 
about these matters with members of the French Royal Academy of Science 
(<a href="#cohen_1981" id="citation_cohen_1981_67dc9bb378bf4">Cohen 1981</a>). In the early 19th-century, the Belgium premier performance 
in 1830 of Auber&rsquo;s opera <i>La muette de Portici</i> inspired the revolt 
against Dutch rule in Belgium. Luigi Dallapiccola, a modernist and 
serialist for most of his career, wrote politically committed music that 
was hardly in support of the status quo. 
</p> 
 
<p>[3.6] As to the following opposition &ldquo;cerebral, complex&rdquo; versus &ldquo;physical, 
performative, simple,&rdquo; where is the locus of cerebral or complex in this 
opposition? Is it in the score, in the composer&rsquo;s mind during the acts of 
composition, in the minds of the performers during the act of performing, 
in the minds of the listeners, or some combination of the preceding? The 
same questions can be asked of the word &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; What are the criteria 
for judgment? Born does not present them. 	
</p>  
 
<p>[3.7] The opposition of &ldquo;text-centered&rdquo; versus &ldquo;practice-centered&rdquo; where 
practice-centered means scores which do not use traditional musical 
notation and typically exist as written instructions to performers is 
based on a misunderstanding of the inherent nature and limitations of 
notation for any piece of music. No notational system can convey all of 
the information necessary for performers to realize the score successfully 
in sound. Only the outlines of the most important features of a piece of 
music can be communicated in a score; performers must rely upon a variety 
of concepts not directly addressed in the score in order to realize it. 
Thus, any opposition here does not reside in text-centeredness or 
practice-centeredness, but rather in the fact that different types of 
music have different aesthetic viewpoints and, thus, different structuring 
processes based on those aesthetics. These differences are reflected in 
the notational systems the composer selects or develops in order to 
communicate the most important features of the piece&mdash;according to the 
composer&mdash;to performers most likely to perform the piece for audiences 
already extant or possibly only imagined. 
</p> 
 
<p>[3.8] &ldquo;Linear, cumulative, teleological&rdquo; versus &ldquo;cyclical, repetitive, 
static&rdquo; falls to many counter-examples. Jonathan Kramer has showed the 
deep non-linearity of modernist composers such as Schoenberg, Stravinsky, 
Stockhausen, and Webern (<a href="#kramer_1988" id="citation_kramer_1988_67dc9bb378bf6">Kramer 1988</a>). The concept here of &ldquo;cumulative&rdquo; 
is undefined by Born. While some modernist pieces can be construed as 
&ldquo;teleological,&rdquo; others may better be described as &ldquo;generative&rdquo; (<a href="#hermann_1994" id="citation_hermann_1994_67dc9bb378bf8">Hermann 1994</a>, <a href="#hermann_1995" id="citation_hermann_1995_67dc9bb378bfb">1995</a>). The second movement of modernist and serialist Webern&rsquo;s Piano 
Variations, Op. 27 could easily be described as &ldquo;cyclical, repetitive,&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;static.&rdquo;  
</p> 
 
<p>[3.9] The sole opposition contained &ldquo;Within a unity of difference to 
popular music,&rdquo; &ldquo;nonreference, absolute difference, nonacknowledgment&rdquo;  
versus &ldquo;reference, transformation&rdquo; is also fraught with problems. Mahler&rsquo;s 
Symphonies and Debussy&rsquo;s piano music employed quotations and parodies of 
folk and popular musics; Schoenberg and his students made arrangements of 
works by Johann Strauss, the &ldquo;Waltz-King&rdquo;; with his Ebony Concerto, 
Stravinsky fills a commission from swing/jazz band-leader Woody Herman;  
Schoenberg and Stravinsky were both involved with film 
music (unsatisfactorily to them as it turns out); and Schoenberg had 
wonderful things to say about the music of George Gershwin. 
</p>  
 
<p>[3.10] Two oppositions are contained within Born&rsquo;s category of &ldquo;Within a 
unity on technology.&rdquo; The first is &ldquo;scientistic, theoreticist&rdquo; versus 
&ldquo;empiricist, artisanal.&rdquo; As science is usually described as being heavily 
empirical, the &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; seems empty. As for composers employing theory 
in a prescriptive manner, the great majority of works that we today 
consider to be the body of music theory handed down to us over many 
centuries were written by composers, and most of these are solidly 
prescriptive. Not only have modernists Babbitt, Boulez, and Schoenberg 
written theoretical treatises so have the postmodern or experimentalist 
composers (per Born&rsquo;s description) Reich (page 303), and Cage (page 56); 
although the writings of Reich and Cage are not usually described that 
way, the description falls within Born&rsquo;s range for theory. Further, just 
because some composers do not write down and disseminate theoretical 
materials does not justify a conclusion that all such non-disseminating 
composers are not involved with theory and are, therefore, &ldquo;artisanal.&rdquo; 
The second opposition within the category &ldquo;high-tech, institutional&rdquo; 
versus &ldquo;low-tech bricolage, entrepreneurial&rdquo; has the problem of 
equivocation on the term institutional. The development of technology 
whether deemed &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; or &ldquo;low&rdquo; is dependent on institutions that can 
amass the people, finances, and equipment needed whether the institution 
is deemed entrepreneurial or not. Many modernist composers in American 
academe run and produce pieces in computer music studios that are quite 
&ldquo;low-tech&rdquo; in comparison with those at Stanford, IRCAM, MIT, or UCSD. 
</p>  
 
<p>[3.11] The last of Born&rsquo;s categories, &ldquo;institutional base,&rdquo; also has two 
oppositions within it. The first, &ldquo;east coast universities&rdquo; versus &ldquo;west 
coast, art colleges, art institutions,&rdquo; suffers from numerous exceptions. 
The University of California at Berkeley had the modernist Andrew Imbrie 
as its lead composition professor for many years. The University of 
California at Los Angeles supported Schoenberg, and Stravinsky lived in 
the same town. The Princeton-educated serialist John Rahn has taught for 
many years at the University of Washington at Seattle. On the east coast, 
Robert Cogan (a music theorist and post-modernist composer) received his 
terminal degree from Princeton and has taught at the New England 
Conservatory (Boston) for over twenty-five years. Thomas DeLio, an 
experimentalist composer and music theorist specializing in both modernist 
and experimentalist music, teaches at the University of Maryland at 
College Park. The second opposition is &ldquo;institutionally and state-backed&rdquo; 
versus &ldquo;self-employed, performance-backed.&rdquo; Again, counter examples are 
easy to come by. The modernists Stravinsky and Copland supported 
themselves while postmodernists/experimentalists Cogan and DeLio are 
institutionally supported. 
</p>  
 
<p>[3.12] Given the above, major portions of this book that build upon 
aesthetic concepts of modernism, avant-garde, experimentalism, and 
postmodernism are simply without foundation. Efforts to save these 
descriptions of aesthetic positions founder upon the counter-examples, 
the false dichotomy, and vague, undefined, or misunderstood terms, and any 
future appeals to &ldquo;exceptions prove the rule&rdquo; are incoherent as any 
philosopher or logician can confirm. 
</p> 
 
<p>[3.13] In all fairness, Born is aware that there are multiple aesthetic 
positions within these terms. But she misses several opportunities to 
bolster (or salvage) her theoretical foundation. For example, one such 
tactic might be to define systematically various versions of these broad 
aesthetic categories and tie them to specific groups of composers at 
specific times and locations as appropriate. In one case involving an 
IRCAM brand of postmodernism, Born has done just that (pages 300&ndash;04);  
however in Born&rsquo;s book, these broad aesthetic terms suffer from equivocation  
or lack of contrast because the various &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; of these aesthetic 
positions are either not systematically defined, referred to, or related 
to one another. 
</p> 
 
<p>[3.14] Another tactic might be to declare that these are a proposed formal 
or idealistic definition of these terms and that various composers inhabit 
a continuum of states between these two aesthetic poles. Thus some 
composers are perhaps more &ldquo;modernist&rdquo;; others are more &ldquo;experimentalist&rdquo;; 
and still others occupy a position somewhere in between. But I can think 
of no major composer&mdash;much less groups of composers&mdash;who completely 
occupies either of these polar positions of aesthetic opposition&mdash;even for 
a single &ldquo;stylistic period&rdquo; of their careers. But given the problems with 
the figure mentioned above, why should this particular formalist 
definition be accepted over others that could be constructed by exchanging 
one or more locations of the contents of binary oppositions from one 
proposed aesthetic pole to the other?  Without specific reasons for why 
the contents of the binary oppositions should be distributed in the 
proposed manner, the choice of any one of the many possible permutations 
of the contents of these binary oppositions between the two polar 
aesthetic positions is simply arbitrary. 
</p> 

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>4. Problems with basic definitions and musical concepts</b></a></p>

<p>[4.1] The assumption made in this book is that these terms apply to music.  
We see that the problems with these aesthetic terms for music are many as 
these terms were not generated from music criticism, but rather from other 
cultural domains such as architecture, art criticism and literary 
criticism, among others. Born&rsquo;s considerable difficulties in dealing with 
these terms is evidence that this assumption might, at best, not yet have 
found a coherent form or, at worst, is simply not applicable. For insight 
into how the term postmodernism might apply to music composition and  
music theory, see <a href="#cogan_1995" id="citation_cogan_1995_67dc9bb378c0c">Cogan 1995</a>, <a href="#cook_1995" id="citation_cook_1995_67dc9bb378c0d">Cook 1995</a>, and <a href="#kramer_1995" id="citation_kramer_1995_67dc9bb378c0f">Kramer 1995</a>.
</p> 	 
 
<p>[4.2] Other significant problems surface in Born&rsquo;s discussions of 
&ldquo;serialism,&rdquo; &ldquo;neoclassicism,&rdquo; &ldquo;mediation&rdquo; as applied to computer 
compositional process, and also &ldquo;modernism&rdquo; in regard to the terms &ldquo;tonal&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;modal.&rdquo; The term serialism is of particular importance because the 
main human subject of this study, Boulez, reached fame as a serial 
composer. But later Boulez retreated from total serialism. Thus Born 
classifies Boulez&rsquo;s current work as &ldquo;postserialist&rdquo;&mdash;a type of modernism 
she uses to describe composers who &ldquo;continued in the scientistic, 
deterministic, rationalist, and theoreticist vein of total serialism, to 
which was increasingly added a prominent technological dimension<nobr> . . . </nobr>It 
is the discourse that Boulez began to enunciate in the late &lsquo;60s and that 
became the basis of his manifesto for IRCAM&rdquo; (pages 55&ndash;6). 
</p> 
 
<p>[4.3] Born states that &ldquo;Serialism implies the principle of the homogeneity 
of chromatic space, while by contrast tonality centers on the functional 
and symbolic hierarchy of the tonic or key note, its dominant and 
subdominant. In this sense, serialism negates the hierarchical ordering 
of pitch space in tonality (page 48).&rdquo; Her footnote 17 (page 349) further adds: 
&ldquo;According to this principle, each pitch in the series has equal importance  
and is dependent upon its position relative to the other eleven notes.&rdquo;
</p>  	 
 
<p>[4.4] Clearly whether composer, artist, or writer, the techniques of any 
style or technique can be used with greater or lesser acuity. Serialism as 
practiced by such composers as Schoenberg, Webern, Berg, Stravinsky, 
Dallapicolla, Babbitt, Martino, Wuorinen, and others does not always  
represent a &ldquo;homogeneity of chromatic space&rdquo; in actual composition; there  
are often &ldquo;functional and symbolic hierarchies&rdquo; between pitch-classes.  
Thus, each pitch-class does not have equal importance; moreover, in both  
theory and practice, unordered set-class relations and transformational  
relations between overlapping and non-overlapping subsets of pitch-classes  
in a series are frequently more important than the relations between  
adjacent pitch-classes.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Much misleading thought about 
serialism is in  
print and careful examination of actual scores by recognized serial composers  
in conjunction with accurate information and concepts would greatly clarify  
the situation. Certainly, serial music &ldquo;negates the hierarchical ordering of  
pitch space in tonality&rdquo; just as surely as modal music (very loosely, music  
before 1600) does. Both systems conceive of pitch space in their own ways;  
otherwise, they would not have their own musical identities and, indeed,  
would be tonal. 
</p> 

<p>[4.5] Another common misconception concerns neoclassicism in 
twentieth-century music: frequently, serialism or expressionism has been 
set up as antipodal with neoclassicism. Schoenberg and his followers are  
the exemplars of serialism or expressionism, whereas Stravinsky (excluding 
his last serial style-period) and his followers are the exemplars of neoclassicism.  
On this topic Born says &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>neoclassicism associated with composers such as  
Stravinsky and Hindemith: an attempt to reinvigorate the present by reference  
to the principles of musics from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and  
earlier&rdquo; (page 49). However, Straus (<a href="#straus_1990b" id="citation_straus_1990b_67dc9bb378c14">1990b</a>) makes a quite convincing case that  
these &ldquo;neoclassic&rdquo; tendencies were every bit as evident in the work of Schoenberg  
and his followers as in the so-called neoclassists.  
</p> 
 
<p>[4.6] Born points out the difficulties that composers have in learning to 
compose through specification of all aspects of sound with a computer 
&ldquo;language&rdquo;&mdash;a &ldquo;patch language&rdquo; in Born&rsquo;s terminology&mdash;designed 
specifically for the purpose. These composer generated instructions then 
must be automatically &ldquo;translated&rdquo; into an all-purpose computer language 
then into assembly language and finally into machine language after which 
the computer generates a digital stream that is recorded on tape or hard 
drive. This digital stream can then be converted into sound waves and 
heard as the music the composer originally specified. Born has this to say 
about the extensive &ldquo;mediation&rdquo; between composer specification and  
verification of effort through sound: 
</p>

<blockquote>
 
    <nobr> . . . </nobr>computer patch languages were characterized by profound 
    abstraction, complex scientistic conceptualization, and delay:  in 
    other words by extreme mediation, both temporal and conceptual. 
    From this stems a further limitation inherent in earlier computer 
    music.  Given the exhaustive acoustic information required by 
    patch programs and the time delays before playback of a sound, it 
    was very difficult for the user to isolate precisely which 
    parameters were responsible for which aspect of the resultant 
    sound.  Not only was it therefore difficult to judge which 
    parameter to change in order to improve the sound, but the 
    programs treated each acoustic parameter independently and did not 
    lend themselves to exploring the interplay between them.  So in 
    addition to the programs being abstract and laborious, users found 
    them unpredictable (page  182). 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>[4.7] Born is correct in pointing out the occasionally quite frustrating 
difficulties of the compositional processes employing computers. At times 
a few hours or days&mdash;in most highly powerful &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; computer 
studios the machine must be shared among several composers&mdash;are required 
before composers can hear the results of their work. However, any composer 
who teaches a standard orchestration course at the university level can 
attest to the fact that computer composers are hardly alone with many of 
these kinds of difficulties. Students read a textbook on how to write for 
the individual orchestral instruments and their combinations in this 
course, and they frequently have to wait days if not weeks to hear the 
results. They also are baffled as to which &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; to change in order 
to improve the sound. Further, textbooks give only vague descriptions of 
the sound, and what information they do give is hopelessly inadequate.  
Experienced instrumentalists with analytical minds and acute hearing 
unsurprisingly tend to do little better than singers, pianists, or organists  
at the initial stages. For budding composers or orchestrators must not  
only know the ranges of the instruments but also the timbral, 
articulative, and dynamic possibilities within each subrange of each 
instrument. In the end, professionals even learn the rudiments of the 
playing techniques such as the fingering systems for each instrument. If 
learning all of the various individual instrumental &ldquo;codes&rdquo; is not enough, 
then the problems must be faced of how to employ all of the available 
instrumental combinations in all their possible subranges with all of 
their possible variables. Even quite experienced composers and  
orchestrators get surprised by the results from time to time when trying  
something new. Making even slight changes in the way instruments are  
used based on hearing an earlier version of the music requires notating  
the changes in a score and then copying out the parts for each  
instrumentalist. This process can take days of very hard, unmusical, and  
boring work.  
</p>
 
<p>[4.8] Thus, we see that those who write for the orchestra have problems 
very similar to those encountered by composers working with computers. By 
not providing this continuing historical context, Born gives a reader not 
knowledgeable about music the false impression that &ldquo;modernism&rdquo; and 
technology have created an artificial, difficult, abstract compositional 
process heretofore unknown; one that would appear to make it nearly 
impossible to create &ldquo;good&rdquo; music. Just as composers and orchestrators 
learn over a sometimes quite considerable period of time how to write for 
the orchestra so have composers learned how to write for the computer.  
</p>
 
<p>[4.9] On modernism and in regard to the terms &ldquo;tonal&rdquo; and &ldquo;modal,&rdquo; Born 
claims that &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>the modernist aesthetic eschews tonal or modal bases; it 
is arhythmic or rhythmically irregular and avoids pulse and sustained 
pattern in favor of calculated durations and complex irregular temporalities;  
it avoids perceptible or simple repetition; and improvisation, if brought in,  
is highly constrained and determined by score-based compositional  
directives&rdquo; (page 302). 
</p>
 
<p>[4.10] While it is true that some modernist pieces satisfy some of these claims,  
far more counter-examples exist. For example, nearly all of Hindemith&rsquo;s  
music is in some sense tonal or modal, and it has regular pulse and  
employs sustained patterning. Most of Stravinsky&rsquo;s music does, too.  
In the midst of his last and serial style-period, Schoenberg wrote his  
Theme and Variations for Band, Op. 43a and Variations on a Recitative  
for Organ, Op. 40 both of which he considered to be tonal pieces.   
Debussy too used tonal and modal materials. Any piece from any  
&ldquo;style-period&rdquo; (e.g. Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Modernist,  
Postmodernist, etc.) that uses what today is considered standard notation 
must literally have &ldquo;calculated durations&rdquo; because inscription of 
rudimentary temporal relations into a score relies upon multiple systems 
of proportions.  
</p>
 
<p>[4.11] I propose that most of the music that we continue to listen to from 
the past (limited here to Western &ldquo;art music&rdquo;) features &ldquo;complex irregular 
temporalities.&rdquo; It seems to me that the primary issue is how these 
manifest themselves in the various styles. In the music of Boulez, the 
durations of local and relatively adjacent events in the score present 
complex durational relationships while the larger design rhythms are 
comparatively simple. In Mozart or Haydn, the local and relatively 
adjacent events in the score are rhythmically comparatively simple while 
the translocal pitch and design structures are rhythmically quite 
complex.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>[4.12] The statement (in paragraph [33] above) that score-based 
improvisation &ldquo;is highly constrained and determined by score-based 
compositional directives&rdquo; exposes Born&rsquo;s misunderstanding on the nature of 
improvisation. Even though some rock, blues, and jazz musicians do not 
read or make scores in traditional musical notation, my experience 
performing with such musicians reveals them to be highly aware of the 
technical structure of the music and the ways in which improvised 
materials relate to this structure. In essence, not only are they able to 
construct a mental score for each work, but they are intuitively cognizant 
of classes of such pieces. Besides, in the last thirty years, more and 
more rock, blues, and jazz musicians do read music and make scores. 
</p> 
  
<p>[4.13] We see that Born has difficulties not only with aesthetic concepts 
but also more directly with technical concepts and even relatively recent 
historical facts about music. These difficulties are understandable given 
her comparative lack of technical training or historical study of music. 
Born&rsquo;s qualifications in music consists of quite brief conservatory 
training and some performance experience with several kinds of popular 
musics (page 7). Further, she did not analyze any of the music under 
discussion (page 23).  
</p>
 
<p>[4.14] In this light, Born&rsquo;s relative ignorance of aesthetic, technical, and 
historical concepts in music is not surprising. Perhaps Born&rsquo;s consultant 
musicologists challenged her with the easily supplied counter-examples and 
pointed out the flaws in her aesthetic reasoning. Perhaps her technical 
and historical errors in music were pointed out. Perhaps Born ignored 
their advice. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>5. The hidden agenda?</b></a></p>

<p>[5.1] The following statements by Born show another and quite different 
side of this book: blatant, unsubstantiated, and unmediated value 
judgments against modernism, at least as practiced by IRCAM. She writes  
&ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>the notion underlying the many instances that we saw within IRCAM of 
more arbitrary conceptual foraging from science (genetic biology, fractal 
geometry) as a basis for composition&rdquo; (page 318); and &ldquo;the  
instruments&mdash;trussed up in wires for measurement, pieced by intrusive 
electrodes and electronically monitored, the trumpet sacrificed to failed 
experiment&mdash;represent a kind of torturous binding of the musical body, an 
attempt to capture and so rationalize their complex organic aural 
workings&rdquo; (page 233); and &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>the sense of sterility attached to 
composition techniques such as serialism<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo; (page 198). These are only a 
few of several such prejudicial statements found throughout.
</p>  
 
<p>[5.2] In response to these attacks on modernism, I might point out that, 
after Mark Evan Bonds (<a href="#bonds_1991" id="citation_bonds_1991_67dc9bb378c31">1991</a>), one could accuse Mozart, Haydn, and other 
18th-century composers of &ldquo;arbitrary conceptual foraging&rdquo; in rhetoric 
and Liszt, Wagner, and other 19th-century composers of the same in 
biology (organicism). The trumpet with various scientific measurement 
apparatus attached to it (found as 9. within a picture section between 
pages 222&ndash;23) can hardly be anthropomorphised into a natural object or being. 
For several hundred years, the sciences and associated technologies of 
metallurgy, geometry, and acoustics have been involved in its design and 
manufacture. The precedents for rational tuning systems&mdash;one of which the 
trumpet is designed to use&mdash;go back at least to Pythagoras. Some 
experimentalists such as Harry Partch (<a href="#partch_1974" id="citation_partch_1974_67dc9bb378c33">1974</a>) rationally construct their 
own tuning systems and create instruments to play in them. I know of no 
musicians who advocate a rejection of trumpets in favor of a return to the 
ram&rsquo;s horn. What of people who do not believe that &ldquo;composition techniques 
such as serialism&rdquo; are not sterile? Are they wrong? If so, why are they 
wrong? Born does not tell us.  
</p>
 
<p>[5.3] Among the somewhat more sophisticated of Born&rsquo;s attacks on 
modernism&mdash;again, in some cases at least as practiced by IRCAM&mdash;are 
implicit judgments of modernism as psychoanalytically sick, beset by 
crisis, and sexist. Taking the charge of sexism first, Born shows 
(pages 120, 134) that only two women reach mid-level management positions 
during her residency, and few women were allowed to produce pieces 
using IRCAM&rsquo;s resources. On the face of it, this is a dismal record, but 
there are no sets of control data. What of the many other nationally 
supported French musical establishments that are clustered in Paris along 
with IRCAM? What of other similar musical institutions or art museums in 
Western Europe? Anecdotally, both the Berlin and Munich Symphony 
orchestras were within the last ten years thrown into turmoil when women 
won auditions respectively for the principal clarinet and principal 
trombone positions. Both were not permitted to retain their positions. As 
of summer 1994, the Vienna Philharmonic appeared to have no women members 
in a concert I witnessed at the Salzburg festival.

<p>[5.4] Indeed, many have written of a sense of crisis in composition for 
this century; however, Born does not consider much less disprove the 
possibility that this crisis may well touch experimentalists and 
postmodernists too. Similar kinds of statements of despair have come from 
the visual arts in the 1970s and in literature in the 1980s. This problem 
or crisis is hardly unique to musical modernism. Part of the problem is 
equivocation on the term &ldquo;success.&rdquo; For Born, it means acceptance of an 
aesthetic movement&rsquo;s creations by a mass audience or at least the 
technical influence of the same on mass culture and its products. She 
claims that avant-garde visual arts has had impact on the commercial 
market (page 4); however, she fails to note that modernist musical styles 
have influenced mass market film composers when they depict the future, 
technology, ambiguous situations, or horror. But why should we accept 
Born&rsquo;s definition of success and not some other? How can we compare 
success for Bach or Beethoven with success for today&rsquo;s composers, 
&ldquo;popular&rdquo; or not? Born does not engage these issues. By her measure of 
success, a Ford Taurus is a better automobile than a Mercedes-Benz. By 
this populist measure, it may be quite difficult if not impossible for any 
kind of &ldquo;high art&rdquo; whether Baroque or Postmodernist to &ldquo;succeed.&rdquo;  
</p>
 
<p>[5.5] Another part of the problem is the increasing ease of dissemination 
of cultural materials throughout the majority of socio-economic classes in 
the West. This is a by-product of technological and economical 
development, the ability to measure marketing success such as &ldquo;name 
recognition&rdquo; and sales of products among the population as a whole&mdash;even 
among various kinds of small sociological subgroups. Further, we now have 
had relative stagnation&mdash;and even decline in the arts&mdash;of educational 
breadth and rigor for the last two and a half decades in the United 
States. These factors have not been sufficiently accounted for in cultural 
analyses of &ldquo;high art&rdquo; music. Born does not address these larger issues. 
</p>
 
<p>[5.6] In describing especially American composers operating within IRCAM, 
Born advances Melanie Klein&rsquo;s psychoanalytic concept of &ldquo;splitting&rdquo; to 
account for how these composers dealt with the various kinds of &ldquo;low,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;high&rdquo; musical art forms. Perhaps some composers did employ 
this maladaptive psychoanalytic mechanism. However, Born gave no 
consideration to the possibility that there could be positive conscious 
attitudes within composers who practiced or admired modernistic musics and 
other musics. The thought that various kinds of music serve different 
functions within a culture and that to compare directly their aesthetic 
and technical positions might reveal a deep incommensurability was not 
explored by Born. Yet this notion of differing kinds of music serving 
different functions within Western culture is of at least four centuries 
standing. Considered in a more positive way, composers participating in 
composing or enjoying modernist music on one hand and non-modernist, even 
popular musics on the other need not display a psychoanalytically 
primitive defense mechanism or aesthetic disarray any more so than say 
Beethoven when he wrote popular flute and piano arrangements of Scottish 
folk-songs for the commercial publishing market of his day. One may wonder 
if it is possible within Born&rsquo;s analytical model to be psychoanalytically 
healthy and also like, perform, or compose modernist music while also 
liking, performing, or composing &ldquo;other&rdquo; musics. 
</p>
 
<p>[5.7] Foucault&rsquo;s work has made it abundantly clear that ideas have 
political consequences and raise serious ethical issues whether or not 
they are so acknowledged in a text. At least one anthropologist (<a href="#barrett_1984" id="citation_barrett_1984_67dc9bb378c35">Barrett 1984</a>) has made the point that the field must be morally involved in the 
issues surrounding socio-cultural phenomena that are the subject of study: 
all such study is value-ladened. Thus, as readers we might well wonder 
what Born&rsquo;s values are and how she accounts for her prejudices that follow 
from those values.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Born claims not to have a hidden 
agenda of 
vindicating postmodernism (page 10). Yet there are no negative value 
judgements made by Born against composers and concepts she associates with 
experimentalist or postmodern composition, and we have seen several 
blatant and unsupported as well as more sophisticated attacks on 
modernism, her &ldquo;other&rdquo; with regard to postmodernism and experimentalism as 
shown by her <b>Figure 1</b> reproduced above. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section6"><b>6. Conclusion</b></a></p>
 
<p>[6.1] In the end, at least with regard to music aesthetics, history, 
theory, and analysis, Born&rsquo;s book may well be successful in preaching to 
the less thoughtful or rabid members of the musical &ldquo;experimentalist&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;postmodernist&rdquo; choir. Simply put, this book is a polemic; it is not 
scholarship. Even so, Born&rsquo;s work does point out the pressing need to 
examine cultural institutions with a variety of concepts from multiple 
academic disciplines. This, however, should be done with prejudices and 
values clearly revealed, with charity in presenting positions with which 
the author disagrees, and with appropriate context provided. That done, 
substantial engagement of well presented and thought-out issues can 
further scholarly discourse and knowledge while taking into account the 
various kinds of power relations between those directly and indirectly 
involved.</p>
