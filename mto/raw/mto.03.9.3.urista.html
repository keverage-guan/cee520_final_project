<h4>
<a name="top"></a>[1] Introduction </h4>
<p>
<blockquote>&ldquo;What the music I love expresses to me, is not thought too <i>indefinite</i> to be put into words, but, on the contrary, too <i>definite</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>
[1.1] 
Musicians have long sought to develop more effective ways of teaching their 
craft. These efforts have traditionally found their most immediate expression, 
naturally, in words, though contrived melodies and dictation exercises are more 
recent manifestations of pedagogical tools. When one considers, however, the 
visceral, physical nature of music, it seems curious that current pedagogy 
places relatively little emphasis on <i>nonverbal </i>approaches to musical 
understanding. At the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, I have discovered that an 
embodied approach is more meaningful to students, because it affords them a 
direct link to the <i>physical associations </i>related to perception and 
performance. </p>
<p>
[1.2] In my experience I have found it essential to engage the body, which helps 
to promote skills that are vital to a competent musician. As David Lidov has 
noted, there is a sense &ldquo;of strong and intimate correspondences between the 
details of music and bodily properties: gestures, tensions, and postures as well 
as <nobr>. . .</nobr> states of consciousness, moods, and emotions. These correspondences which 
involve kinesthesia in a direct <nobr>. . .</nobr> way appear ubiquitous <nobr>. . .</nobr> movement is not a 
&lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of music but rather an intrinsic property.&rdquo; Many of us wonder how to 
communicate these deep physical sensations and personal feelings we experience 
when listening to music that are often difficult, if not impossible, to capture 
in words; such intrinsic properties we often refer to as the ineffable.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[1.3] This 
article proposes that instructors at the college level consider a nonverbal 
approach&mdash;the moving body. I demonstrate and discuss the practical applications 
and advantages of using the moving body as a tool for learning, analyzing, and 
communicating music in the classroom, a tool that enhances kinesthetic awareness 
and music perception. Video performances from a first- and second-year 
conservatory classroom of the scenarios are presented to convey the benefits of 
moving-to-music. These scenarios are inspired by the work of Roger Graybill, 
Alexandra Pierce, and several Eurhythmics practitioners.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[1.4] Although 
some people assume that Eurhythmics is for children, it is important to note 
that Dalcroze&rsquo;s ideas were originally designed to improve learning for adults at 
the Conservatory of Music in Geneva, where he taught harmony and solf&egrave;ge. 
Eurhythmics is a music education approach that consists of three main parts: 
 
solf&egrave;ge, improvisation, and movement-to-music, which is the part that I will 
focus on. The main impetus behind Dalcroze&rsquo;s approach grew out of his overall 
dissatisfaction with musical instruction at the Conservatory. He questioned why 
music theory was often taught only through abstractions divorced from sound, 
feeling, and motion. One of his primary goals was to heal what he perceived as 
the &ldquo;mind-body split&rdquo; in musical training and to promote an approach that 
stimulates, develops and refines all the capacities we use to engage in music: 
the aural, visual, tactile and muscular senses. He believed our physical 
movements were powerful referents for understanding musical rhythms, pitch, and 
motion. Many believe a connection exists between our aural impression of music 
and the kinesthetic sense, which many refer to as the &ldquo;neglected&rdquo; perception, or 
&ldquo;sixth&rdquo; sense. As Schnebly-Black and Moore explain, &ldquo;Dalcroze teachers blend the 
aural perceptions of dynamics, beat, and pitches with muscular sensations of 
time, space, and energy. Out of this combination evolves a more subtle and 
expressive set of musical impulses and musical understanding. The addition of 
body movement to music training increases the amount of sensory information 
forming musical perceptions. When the whole body is used, the nervous system 
draws information from many networks: not just the hands, but the arms, 
shoulders, rib cage, and hips. The eyes, and ears, as well, join in a blending 
of sensory systems that reinforce each other in receiving and analyzing musical 
information.&rdquo; I now discuss six musical scenarios, each of which is designed to 
teach a specific musical concept.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<h4>
[2] SCENARIO  1a: Exercise Designed to 
Teach Cadence </h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Video Clip 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="urista_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Video Clip 1 thumbnail" src="urista_clip1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>
[2.1] The first scenario is a typical Eurhythmics exercise that 
fosters the recognition of cadences and explores the varying subtle shades of 
nuance among different kinds of cadences. Depending on available space, anywhere 
from five to twenty students can work comfortably. The students are placed 
randomly about the room, holding short wooden dowels. They are asked to move 
freely and to walk in time to the music that is played on the piano. When the 
final chord of the cadence has sounded, the students are to touch another 
person&rsquo;s dowel with their own. The instructor plays musical exercises developed 
specifically for this purpose&mdash;four-bar phrases that end with different 
cadences: perfect and imperfect authentic, half, and deceptive. <b>Video Clip 1</b> shows students who have performed the exercise and are acquainted 
with the music.</p>
<p>
[2.2] As the movers become aware of the types of 
cadences, different physical gestures emerge that reflect the subtle qualities 
of the various cadences. For some types of cadences, the movers touch dowels 
gently and lightly above their heads; for other cadences they touch dowels 
swiftly and precisely near the waist. They also begin to exhibit facial 
expressions that mimic the cadences&rsquo; bold or tranquil character. A few movers 
physically represent the deflective effect of the deceptive cadence through the 
postural change of bending backward or to the side. Several movers join together 
at the end to represent the finality of the last perfect cadence. </p>
<p>
[2.3] What 
takes place is a spontaneous, living analysis of phrase and cadence. Rather than 
passively talking <i>about </i>the idea of cadence before or after the music is 
heard, movers actively create a physical gesture <i>with </i>the cadence while it is 
being played&mdash;a personal response derived from the musical event itself that 
engages the kinesthetic sense. A traditional classroom setting typically 
involves the discussion and labeling of a musical concept. But as Eurhythmics 
teachers Moore and Schnebly-Black explain, &ldquo;Eurhythmics focuses on the 
[physical] sensation itself, letting one moment develop into the next-seeking 
not identification but sensory continuity. Through Eurhythmics, people learn to 
use information fresh from sensation information fresh from sensation, before it 
has been consciously analyzed.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[2.4] 
Often times, during and after completing a physical activity such as the one 
just described, students ask questions about the kinds of cadences they have 
experienced, at which point we move to the board and begin traditional labeling. 
It is imperative that students experience first the sensations of a new musical 
idea, before identifying and analyzing it. </p>
<p>
[2.5] I have noticed that students 
gain a deeper understanding of a concept by making their own physical 
representation of it and by seeing those of others. By &ldquo;physical representation&rdquo; 
I am suggesting a type of metaphor that is the body&rsquo;s response to what is being 
perceived. When the association between aural perception and physical reaction 
meld, then the physical representation becomes an effective tool for realizing 
the subtle nuances of a passage. This interactive process heightens sensitivity 
and enhances the internalization of musical concepts. This is one of the reasons 
why moving-to-music is such a powerful learning tool. The aural, muscular, 
visual, and tactile senses are all engaged in the encoding of information. You 
may have noticed that some of the students are more adept than others at moving 
through space and representing the varying degrees of nuance among cadences. For 
instance, at the first cadence, one student did not anticipate the necessary 
time to meet with another person. Negotiating time and space, while listening to 
the conclusion of the phrase, is part of the skill required in this exercise. 
Some students were also late in responding to the cadence itself, and touched 
dowels immediately after rather than on the final chord. With a few simple 
suggestions, these kinds of problems are easily rectified and a student&rsquo;s 
movement technique and accuracy improve quickly. I have found that enhanced 
movement technique equates to better musical perception, performance ability, 
and analytical insight. </p>
<h4>
[3] SCENARIO 1b: Cadence Exercise Converted into a 
Quick-Reaction Exercise </h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Video Clip 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="urista_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Video Clip 2 thumbnail" src="urista_clip2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>
[3.1] Once the participants are comfortable with the 
four-bar groupings, the activity is converted into what Dalcroze calls a 
<i>quick-reaction </i>exercise. This happens by changing the music from a predictable 
pattern of four-bar phrases into an unpredictable mixture of two-, four-, and 
eight-bar phrases. The movers are now caught off guard. Some miss cadences when 
a two-bar phrase occurs instead of the expected four-bar phrase. Some movers 
accidentally touch dowels at the initiation of a phrase expansion, when they 
expect the conclusion of a prototypical four-bar phrase. In the following video, 
the students have practiced the exercise, but some are still surprised; others 
improvise gestures to represent what they hear. For example, some students mark 
the thwarted closure of a phrase extension by almost touching dowels at the 
point of a possible cadence and then pulling away when the extension begins 
(<b>Video Clip 2</b>).</p>
<p>
[3.2] With any quick-reaction exercise, unpredictability is the key 
ingredient, for it is the element of uncertainty that forces students to remain 
alert; this, in turn, strengthens their power of concentration. In this 
particular exercise, students begin to realize that in order to represent the 
cadence at precisely the right time, they <i>have </i>to stay focused and listen 
intently for subtle cues within the music that signal whether the phrase is 
going to close or continue; otherwise they will fail to respond to the cadence. 
Quick-reaction exercises also train students to adapt mentally and to respond 
quickly and physically to change while retaining a sense of mental calm-a skill 
required of any musician. This is one of countless quick-reaction exercises that 
can be used to develop a sense of concentration and alertness. </p>

<p>
[4.1] Now I will discuss another exercise, canon, which can be 
incorporated at any level in the aural skills classroom. In this exercise 
students move to a given rhythm or melody. As they are physically imitating that 
rhythm, another is played for them to imitate, and so forth. In Clip 3 you see 
a simple imitation exercise, where students are imitating one-bar melodic 
fragments. The imitation serves as a warm-up that is then converted into the 
canon, shown in Clip 4. (Play <b>Video Clips 3 and 4</b> back-to-back.)</p>
<p>
[4.2] The canon 
exercise is an excellent tool for developing musical memory. Students are 
engaged in a cycle of hearing, memorizing and physically executing one rhythm, 
while simultaneously committing the next one to memory. Canons also teach the 
art of performing one part while carefully listening to another, an essential 
skill for ensemble playing. The canon in this exercise is simple, featuring 
basic rhythms that are given one measure at a time. By increasing the rhythmic 
complexity and the number of bars in a segment, the difficulty of the exercise 
is increased. A canon can also be designed in such a way that the student 
experiences specific rhythms that play off of each other, for example, dotted or 
syncopated rhythms against straight rhythms. </p>
<p>
[4.3] This canon can also be 
realized in a more traditional manner by speaking (on the syllable &ldquo;tah&rdquo;) or by 
clapping. As Graybill points out, however, whereas speaking teaches the correct 
placement of attack points in a rhythm, it often lacks any musical expression or 
dynamic inflection. He explains, &ldquo;While [the] concept of rhythm as a neutral 
series of attack points and durations may be appropriate in certain contexts, it 
does not accord very well with our experience of rhythm in the fullest sense. 
When we respond to rhythm as listeners or feel a rhythm as performers, we 
experience something vital and dynamic-a flow of energy through time <nobr>. . .</nobr> 
characterized by a dynamic interplay of ebb and flow, of intensification and 
relaxation.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[4.4] Graybill acknowledges the association of 
this dynamic aspect of rhythm with physical movement and refers to it as 
<i>gestural rhythm</i>, the fluidity of which is captured by movement. Moving the 
body through space allows the student to shape in expressive ways the musical 
spaces <i>between </i>and <i>through </i>beats. Musical spaces that are active and open to 
interpretation can be amplified and enlivened kinesthetically with straight and 
curved flow paths, changes in direction, varying degrees of energy, weight, 
speed, and postural balance-gestural qualities of rhythm that speaking or 
clapping would not as readily access. </p>
<h4>
[5] SCENARIO  3: Beat and Phrase </h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Video Clip 5</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="urista_examples.php?id=4&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Video Clip 5 thumbnail" src="urista_clip5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>
[5.1] The 
next exercise is designed to teach the organization of beat in phrase structure 
and compound meter. In this scenario, students standing in a circle pass a ball 
to one another at time points corresponding to the beats within a measure. One 
of the advantages of this exercise is that it physically illuminates and 
exaggerates what Dalcroze describes as the three main aspects of beat: the 
<i>anacrusis</i>, the physical preparation of the beat; the <i>crusis</i>, the precise 
point of contact; and finally the <i>metacrusis</i>, or afterbeat, the moment of 
rebound and follow-through resulting from the energy exerted from the crusis. In 
the video you will see students who have practiced the exercise and are 
comfortable with passing the ball. They are then directed to change direction 
when the phrase changes. By doing so, students have to listen carefully to both 
the beat and to the phrasing to execute the exercise successfully. (Play <b>Video Clip 5</b>.)</p>
<p>
[5.2] Notice in the video that students made adjustments in timing and energy by 
slightly delaying the arrival of the cruses or by putting more or less weight in 
the cruses to represent the subtle changes in tempo and dynamic fluctuations. 
Notice also that the space between beats, that is, the anacrusis and metacrusis, 
becomes more enlivened and flexible when the tempo slows, allowing more latitude 
for interpretive flexibility. The movement involved in passing the ball 
magnifies the dynamic possibilities that exist between and through the 
articulation of beat.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<h4>
[6] SCENARIO  4: Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; 
Musical Climax </h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Video Clip 6</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="urista_examples.php?id=5&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Video Clip 6 thumbnail" src="urista_clip6_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>
[6.1] Our fourth scenario is designed to explore the dynamic 
shape of phrase and musical climax in Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; in E major from his 
<i>Liederkreis</i>. Here the students focus on the dynamic shape of the vocal 
phrases. They begin by learning the opening phrase (measures 6&ndash;13), which divides 
into two subphrases. The first subphrase begins on the last beat of measure 6 and 
peaks on the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 in measure9 (on the word <i>Himmel</i>). In response, the second 
subphrase rises immediately to the E5 in measure 11, which corresponds to the melodic 
peak <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> of the first subphrase. The exercise involves the students&rsquo; grasping of 
an elastic Chinese jump rope, using its elasticity to respond physically to the 
climactic shape of the subphrases. In this clip, students have heard the piece 
and are beginning to work out the phrasing. (Play <b>Video Clip 6</b>.)</p>
<p>
[6.2] The physical 
tension of the rope is used to intensify the dynamic shape of phrase. The 
stretch of the rope allows students to feel through their muscles the qualities 
of elasticity, the sense of sustained momentum, and the dynamic sense of ebb and 
flow to and from the climactic points in the phrase. </p>
<p>
[6.3] Some are obviously 
more successful than others in representing <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> as the main climactic moment. The 
female student on the right clearly does not know the piece well enough to 
produce a convincing kinesthetic response. In her particular case, her aural 
perception and physical representation have not yet melded. In a real class 
setting students will discuss among themselves the details of representation, 
for example, of how much space to use and where, when to exert the most tension, 
and how long to sustain tension and through which beats. Some will be concerned 
with subtle details of gesturing, of how much space they should feel under their 
arms while raising the rope. Most movers in this reenactment respond by arching 
back and opening their chest to depict the opening of musical space as the 
melodic line rises to the word <i>Himmel</i>. Eventually, they agree and work out a 
unified movement where everyone follows the music perfectly, just as they would 
in a real-life ensemble setting. </p>
<p>
[6.4] In her work on climax and phrase 
structure in Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;, Alexandra Pierce experiments with several 
movements to represent the climactic structure of phrase. Her account is 
intriguing, because the visceral sensation she experiences from moving 
contradicts the words typically used to describe phrase endings. One movement in 
particular she describes is the &ldquo;fountain,&rdquo; which involves bringing her palms 
together as the phrase starts (measure 6), lifting her hands up and outward over her 
head at the moment of climax on the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, and then letting her arms float down to 
her sides as the phrase ends (measure 13). As she explains, &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>after moving to the 
piece several times, the fountaining movement began to present a sense of 
openness <nobr>. . .</nobr> not only at the moment of climax, but even at the phrase ending.&rdquo; 
This feeling of expansion at the conclusion of the phrase surprises her, since 
her felt sensation is in contrast to the conventional verbal expressions used to 
describe phrase endings, such as &ldquo;repose,&rdquo; &ldquo;rest,&rdquo; and &ldquo;stasis.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[6.5] The &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; movement reveals a kinesthetic sensation of expansion that 
could not be represented through words alone. From Pierce&rsquo;s account it is clear that another kind of intelligence was 
informing her: kinesthetic sensations and feelings overtly experienced 
through movement, remembered, and then later drawn upon covertly to enhance 
future listening and performing experiences. Through the continuous practice of 
moving-to-music, the participant draws into consciousness the intricate web of 
kinesthetic information that exists between bodily gesture and musical sound. 
The movement serves as a temporary exaggeration that highlights aspects of the 
musical structure. </p>
<p>
[6.6] Typically in the classroom, students sing phrases and 
identify them by putting expressive markings in their scores. They may carefully 
follow these markings, but their performances often lack subtle nuance. Movement 
activities, such as the ones described here, invite students to investigate the 
infinite dynamic shadings that live <i>behind </i>the notes while they are learning 
and singing a piece. Musicality is not merely discussed or interjected as an 
afterthought; musicality is the main focus and purpose of the activity. </p>
<h4>
[7] 
SCENARIO  5: Form and Bartok&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of the Harvest&rdquo; </h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Video Clip 7</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="urista_examples.php?id=6&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Video Clip 7 thumbnail" src="urista_clip7_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>
[7.1] The final scenario 
portrays a movement analysis of form to Bartok&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of the Harvest&rdquo; from his 
44 Duos for 2 violins. (It will be beneficial for the reader to consult the 
score.) The piece consists of five sections. The first, marked <i>lento</i>, spans 
measures 1&ndash;5 and appears again in an inverted and transposed form at measure 16 and at measure 
30. These sections are interrupted by two faster, canonic eruptions (marked <i>parlando</i>) 
that unfold from measures 6 to 15 and from measures 21 to 29. This is an example of a 
polished performance carefully worked out by two students with Eurhythmics 
experience. In this analysis, their moving bodies represent the duet of 2 
violins. Note the way they negotiate the space of the room and interact with one 
another to represent the beginnings and endings of these five sections. (Play 
<b>Video Clip 7</b>.)</p>
<p>
[7.2] In this rendition the students use a wringing gesture, which is 
facilitated by the stretch of nylon socks to amplify the tense dissonant nature 
of this Bartok piece. Their more sustained motion depicts the character of the 
softer <i>lento </i>sections; then they elapse into a series of abrupt torso bends to 
characterize the aggressive, angular contour of the two canonic sections. </p>
<p>
[7.3] 
In a movement analysis such as this, instead of sketching out on paper the 
beginnings and endings of sections with letter names, labels, or arches, the 
movers instead mark these points with expressive physical gestures. Rather than 
talking <i>about </i>the form, which is traditionally done in a formal analysis, the 
participants&rsquo; bodies <i>become </i>the form. </p>
<h4>
[8] Conclusion </h4>
<p>
[8.1] Reflecting on 
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s words quoted at the beginning of this article, I must admit that 
attempting to convey what it means to move-to-music by talking about it feels 
quite inadequate, that is, it feels so <i>indefinite</i>. Even so, I believe that the 
importance of using the body as a tool for musical understanding needs to be 
heard. </p>
<p>
[8.2] By not using the body to learn about and analyze music, we may be 
denying ourselves the benefits of a dynamic tool that engages our kinesthetic 
sense, strengthens musical memory and our power of concentration, develops and 
stimulates the channels of communication between mind and body, refines physical 
coordination, and opens our ears to finer degrees of subtlety and nuance. 
Especially in a field where many of us as performers use our bodies to make 
music, we may be performing a disservice to our students and ourselves by not 
training <i>both </i>mind and body. Moving-to-music may not be for everyone, but if 
anyone remains skeptical about its virtues, it is important to remember that it 
is something that must be <i>felt </i>within the intimate space of the body to be 
understood, for the understanding comes with the experience of moving.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
