<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] One living composer to watch out for is Poland&rsquo;s Zbigniew
Preisner. March 19, 1999, marked the premiere at London&rsquo;s Royal
Festival Hall of Preisner&rsquo;s <i>Requiem for My Friend</i>. It is his
first work written especially for live performance and recording.
Preisner is best known in the United States as an award-winning
film composer, foremost for his collaborations with Krzysztof
Kieslowski, the friend in the title of the Requiem (<a href="#appendix2" name="ap2Link">Appendix
2</a>).&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[2] Many 20th-century composers have been tempted by film music
at some stage. Generally, I consider film music too popular for
its own good, but Preisner caught my attention in 1993. Missing
the correct screen for my movie, I had accidentally wandered into
a film by the Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. &ldquo;Three
Colours Blue&rdquo; turned out to be the story of a classical composer
who dies in a car accident, and his widow completes his final
symphony.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[3] The symphony at the center of the story, which surfaced only
in fragments, was monumental, quite unlike anything composed in
our century. There were elements of Mahler and Beethoven, but
also of Sibelius. Interestingly, simple woodwinds filled the gap
between the fortissimo and the pianissimo. There was a noticeable
contrast to composers like Gorecki, who is clearly identifiable
as a modern imitation of old styles. The final chorus, in French,
was drawn from the biblical text on charity: &ldquo;Though I speak with
the tongues of angels, if I have not love, my words would resound
but with a tinkling cymbal.&rdquo; In 1995, editors at Oxford
University Press wrote to Kieslowski when updating Oxford&rsquo;s music
encyclopaedia. They had listened to the symphony segments written
by Preisner&rsquo;s pseudonym, Van den Budenmayer (<a href="#appendix3" name="ap3Link">Appendix 3</a>), and
had had an equal reaction to my own. Now they wanted to include
this &ldquo;brilliant, late 18th century, Dutch composer&rdquo; in the
encyclopaedia, and did not believe Kieslowski when he wrote back
to state that the music was written by a living, Polish,
composer. Oxford University Press ended up accusing Kieslowski of
protecting the privacy of a long-dead genius.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[4] Ignorant of who is who in film music, I had made a similar
glitch. Half-hoping to discover some great, unknown talent
stacked away in a little wood hut somewhere in the steppes of
Poland, I wrote to Kieslowski from Canada in 1993, only to be
told that no full-scale work by Preisner existed. He advised me
to buy the soundtrack, and it became the first time for me to do
so. If you like film music, Hans Zimmer is good. Preisner is
good, too. The difference is that Preisner crosses over. Due to
the nature of his chosen medium, he has mainly been reviewed by
film reviewers, but he was recently signed on by the classics
label Erato (Warner) in Paris. The death of Kieslowski may mark a
new era in Preisner&rsquo;s life, and perhaps more concert works will
follow the Reqiuem. Meanwhile, his music continues to reach
people across a wide range of fields, including&mdash;very
obviously&mdash;the classical.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[5] &ldquo;We signed him because we believe that Preisner&rsquo;s work spans
the classical field more than that of any other film composer,&rdquo;
remarks Erato&rsquo;s Christian Hallwig in Paris. &ldquo;His soundtracks have
sold hundreds of thousands of copies, especially in the United
States. We hope to reproduce this success with the Requiem.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[6] Kieslowski&rsquo;s death of a heart attack in 1996 prompted
Preisner to write <i>Requiem for my friend</i>, a highly unusual,
modern work for full orchestra which elicited standing ovations
and three curtain calls at the sold-out Royal Festival Hall. It
is Preisner&rsquo;s first concert music, written not for a mainstream
orchestra but for the people who provide Preisner with his roots:
the Polish orchestra and soloists with whom he has performed for
decades, and whom he knew as a young man. Despite numerous
offers, Preisner has never left Poland to live elsewhere. He is
loyal to his country and his people, and it is easy to see why.
At the end of the concert, a Polish woman beside me, who was not
acquainted with Preisner, got carried away during the standing
ovations. She exclaimed with moist eyes &ldquo;we are so proud of
him&rdquo;&mdash;speaking, one presumes, for all of Poland. Preisner&rsquo;s
rootedness translates into his music, eliciting images of a
composer who remains centered in himself throughout the piece,
despite the trials and tribulations which are the theme of his
unusual Requiem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[7] The work is divided into two parts, Requiem and Life.
Following the Erato recording in Cracow, London marked the first
live performance outside Poland.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[8] Requiem is written in nine movements. It is characterised by
typical Preisner features, long reverberations and expressive
vibrato. He uses small male choir, string quintet, organ and
percussion. The voice of an astonishing Polish soprano, Elzbieta
Towarnicka, dominates both, the first and the second part of the
work. In the second part, Life, the musical background grows into
full chorus (the forty-piece Salisbury festival chorus) and a
sixty-piece orchestra (the BBC concert orchestra) which includes
alto saxophone and recorder.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[9] The Times of London was not quite sure about the high number
of minor thirds which hold the two parts of the work together. It
made no mention of some of Preisner&rsquo;s more unusual features,
which are only for acquired tastes (like using the alto saxophone
for a solo between the two parts). But like everyone else,
London&rsquo;s most prestigious newspaper praised Towarnicka. The
&ldquo;Lacrimosa,&rdquo; which features prominently in both sections,
suggests that her voice must be somewhere around the seven or
eight octave range.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[10] Not much is known about her, an interview was not possible.
A short biography informs that she studied with Barbara
Walczynska at the Krakow Academy of Music in 1978. She worked for
the Krakow opera, singing soprano parts in operas like <i>La Boheme</i>, <i>La
Traviata</i>, <i>Dido and Aeneas</i>, and <i>Tosca</i>. She
performs regularly in Germany, Italy, France, Russia, the United
States, Canada and Sweden. Oratorio and cantata are her
preferences.
</p>

<p>[11] Preisner is self-taught. He was born in 1955 near Krakow,
Poland, and graduated from Krakow university with a degree in
history. His interest in music caused him to buy scores and read
along as the music played on the radio. He started writing small
pieces for cabaret before going into larger works. He met
Towarnicka when working at the local cabaret in Krakow, and then
Kieslowski in the early eighties. The three began a collaboration
which would take them around the world&mdash;and result in many of
Kieslowki&rsquo;s best-known works.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[12] Preisner&rsquo;s music belies his lack of formal training, perhaps
fueling the myth that some of the best composers are self-taught.
He writes for every instrument in the orchestra and then some,
including the organ, and even wine glasses. The London concert
finished with the theme from &ldquo;Blue,&rdquo; played on a recorder. In
stark contrast, this was preceded by the full-chorus &ldquo;Song for
the unification of Europe,&rdquo; which had provided the chorus finale
of the symphony in the movie &ldquo;Blue.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[13] Eduardo Ponti, a filmmaker and the son of Sophia Loren, was
chosen by Preisner to create a concept for the stage version of
his Requiem. &ldquo;A requiem is a ceremony for the Living as much as
for the Dead,&rdquo; Ponti says. &ldquo;The show was to be a dialogue between
the one who has left this world, and the one left behind here. I
wanted it to be simple, human, direct, inspired by the integrity
and purity of the requiem. I wanted an ambience of light and
shadow, but also of courage and hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[14] Preisner describes his own music as &ldquo;border line. It is not
quite film music, and not quite classical. Somewhere in between.
I make creations, creative music. I think in the Requiem I took
one major aspect from film music. My music has names, the title
defines it: Silence, or Peace. &lsquo;Life&rsquo; is a story about life, the
part we have lived, and the part we are still going to live. I
think about death, and for me the question is &lsquo;how shall we live
and die with dignity?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[15] Preisner wrote the first part of the Requiem while
Kieslowski was in hospital, dying. &ldquo;He had gone for a bypass
operation, and was joking about things he would do when he would
leave again. But he never did,&rdquo; recalls Preisner. &ldquo;I composed
some music for his funeral, just organ and voice, and later
expanded it into a full requiem. The final part of the work is a
prayer of Hope, asking for the strength to go on living.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is
very personal,&rdquo; Preisner says. &ldquo;I am asking for the strength to
go on living in this sad situation. In my life, there were only
very few people I wanted to spend time with. One of them was
Krzysztof. This prayer is also a request, that such friendship
could be found once more.&rdquo;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>

[16] Recently, Preisner was commissioned to write the music for
People&rsquo;s Century, a 26-part series on BBC television documenting
the history of the 20th century. Co-produced with WGBH Boston, it
is going to be shown on PBS in the United States.&nbsp;
