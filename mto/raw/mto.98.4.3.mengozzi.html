<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] How did late-Renaissance composers use their music to
communicate with their audiences?  Was there a set of shared
aural expectations between composers and listeners that governed
the relationship between text and music, the inner dynamics of
the individual parts within a polyphonic complex, and even the
perception of intervals, counterpoint, and modes?  In which
specific ways did the various levels of expertise that
16th-century listeners brought to a musical performance affect
their understanding of a madrigal by Marenzio or Wert?  These are
some of the general questions that inform Lionel Pike&rsquo;s
<i>Hexachords in Late-Renaissance Music</i>.  The main goal of this
study is to re-appreciate some of the techniques and procedures
by which the particular &ldquo;language&rdquo; of late-Renaissance music was
able to convey meaning from composers to listeners (or, to use
Dr. Pike&rsquo;s terms, from an &ldquo;encoder&rdquo; to a &ldquo;decoder&rdquo; [p. 1]).  The
study is addressed to those modern readers/listeners who are
already trained in Renaissance music and wish to acquire a fuller
understanding of this repertory: &ldquo;The present-day listener has
lost touch with some of the important elements of the language of
late-Renaissance music: changing patterns of education and
changes in musical style have led to the disappearance of at
least two fundamental elements&mdash;rhetoric and the hexachord&mdash;which
are essential to a true understanding of this music.  The present
book is concerned with the second of these elements&rdquo; (p. 1).
<p>

[2] The book is articulated into five main chapters preceded by a
general introduction.  The first two chapters, &ldquo;Voces Musicales
I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Voces Musicales II,&rdquo; illustrate basic hexachordal
techniques, such as the <i>soggetto cavato</i>, the <i>inganno</i>, and
the practice of using different hexachords for expressive
purposes (&ldquo;hexachord color&rdquo;).  The two following chapters,
&ldquo;Emulation and Parody I&rdquo; and &ldquo;Emulation and Parody II,&rdquo; compare
different madrigals set to the same text, such as &ldquo;Mia benigna
fortuna&rdquo; (by Arcadelt, Lasso, Rore, Wert, and Marenzio) and
&ldquo;Cruda Amarilli&rdquo; (by Wert, Marenzio, Pallavicino, and
Monteverdi), in an attempt to understand how certain composers
utilized solmization for the purpose of &ldquo;emulating&rdquo; or &ldquo;outdoing&rdquo;
the works written by other composers before them.  The final
chapter, &ldquo;Sorrow and Secularism,&rdquo; contains analyses of vocal
music by Tallis (&ldquo;Lamentations&rdquo;) and keyboard music by John Bull,
Alfonso Ferrabosco II, Byrd, Sweelinck, and others.
<p>

[3] Dr. Pike is particularly concerned with describing what he
calls the &ldquo;More Abstruse Uses of the System&rdquo; (p. 67), namely
those advanced hexachordal techniques that composers invented for
the delight of restricted circles of aristocratic amateurs (the
<i>cognoscenti</i>), while also trying to appeal to less educated ears
(p. 12).  For example, the section &ldquo;Marian symbolism&rdquo; (in &ldquo;Voces
Musicales II&rdquo;) suggests that motivic procedures in the motet
&ldquo;Gaude Maria virgo&rdquo; by Peter Philips (1612) associate the Virgin
Mary with the moon (<i>luna</i>), a symbolism which is shown to have
theological and iconographical resonances (pp. 73&ndash;80).  A later
section discusses Gesualdo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moro lasso&rdquo; as an extreme example
of the use of &ldquo;The [Hexachordal] Circle of Fifths&rdquo; in order to
convey the dramatic intensity of the text (pp. 89&ndash;92).  Finally,
Dr. Pike interprets several instances of &ldquo;hexachordal inversion&rdquo;
in Marenzio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cruda Amarilli&rdquo; as a deliberate &ldquo;upsetting of the
hexachord system&rdquo; which would illustrate &ldquo;the topsy-turviness
occasioned by the suffering&rdquo; in the text (pp. 142&ndash;150).
<p>

[4] As these necessarily condensed notes indicate, musical
rhetoric actually figures prominently in <i>Hexachords in
Late-Renaissance Music</i>, in spite of the author&rsquo;s own statement
of intentions to the contrary.  To Dr. Pike&rsquo;s credit, he analyzes
musical structure as a way to appreciate the meaning(s) of
certain compositions and repertories (primarily, Italian secular
music and British keyboard music) viewed as historically situated
acts of communication.  Thus, Dr. Pike deals with music as
rhetoric often in an original and profound way.  For example, a
close analysis of the texts of Tallis&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lamentations&rdquo; leads him
to interpret these pieces as devotional music to be performed in
the privacy of English Catholic houses.  Focusing more
specifically on text/music relations, Dr. Pike captures the
rhetorical sense of the opening episode of the second
&ldquo;Lamentation&rdquo;, which begins on the word &ldquo;Gimel&rdquo; (a Hebrew
letter), by acutely observing that &ldquo;The letter becomes like an
illuminated capital in a manuscript, set off from the rest of the
text by its colourful treatment&rdquo; (p. 187).  In a similar manner,
Dr. Pike&rsquo;s discussion of various settings of &ldquo;Cruda Amarilli&rdquo;
reveals some of the subtle ways in which these settings dialogue
and &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with one another by reusing some of the same
melodic materials while experimenting with voice leading and
dissonance treatment.
<p>

[5] Paradoxically, Dr. Pike&rsquo;s claims are more problematic when he
deals with the subject that he intentionally sets out to explore
in his book, namely the relevance of hexachordal structures in
polyphonic music written around 1600, as the following discussion
will show.
<p>

[6] It is clear from the very title of this study that Dr. Pike
subscribes to a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; view of the Guidonian hexachord, thus
following a line of argument that has been proposed in the last
thirty years or so by scholars such as Gaston Allaire, Richard
Crocker, and Eric Chafe, among others.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  In brief, Dr. Pike
interprets the six syllables as a fundamental diatonic structure
with cognitive implications for Renaissance musicians and
listeners.  In the introduction to the book, for example, Dr.
Pike presents his study as &ldquo;dealing with the period just prior to
the disappearance of the hexachord as a force for the
organization of musical structure&rdquo; (p. 12); in several later
passages, the hexachord is presented as &ldquo;fundamental to the
learning of music&rdquo; (for instance, at pp. 13, 15, and 172).
Because of this, various hexachordal procedures such as mutation
and the <i>soggetto cavato</i> &ldquo;became second nature to any musician
of the time as the notes of the scale are to us today &rdquo; (p. 15).
<p>

[7] A dose of skepticism is in order here, because it is not
clear on what evidence some of these assertions rest.  Indeed one
wishes that Dr. Pike had examined the musical treatises with the
same attention that he dedicates to the lyrics of &ldquo;Cruda
Amarilli&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mia benigna fortuna.&rdquo;  The occasional references
to a handful of theorists, such as Vicentino, Zarlino, Galilei,
Artusi, and Morley, are painfully inadequate to support the
nature and the scope of Dr. Pike&rsquo;s hexachordal theories, which
call for detailed surveys of topics such as hexachordal mutation
and the relationship between the seven letters-names and the six
Guidonian syllables, as understood in the 16th century.
Ironically, Dr. Pike describes Karol Berger&rsquo;s <i>Theories of
Chromatic and Enharmonic Music in Late 16th-Century Italy</i> (Ann
Arbor: UMI, 1976 and 1980) as providing &ldquo;a splendid treatment of
the theorists of the period&rdquo; (p. 17, footnote 24), although
Berger&rsquo;s study is not concerned at all with the issue of
hexachordal solmization.
<p>

[8] More importantly, the role of the hexachord within the
musical systems described by Renaissance theorists&mdash;even those
mentioned by Dr. Pike&mdash;is a matter of debate: Zarlino, for
example, presents the gamut with the seven hexachords in Book II,
ch. 30, of his <i>Istitutioni harmoniche</i> (1558, 1573), but in the
same chapter he also praises Guido for introducing the seven
letter-names (A to G) that reflect octave equivalence.
Furthermore, Zarlino hardly refers to any Guidonian syllable at
all in the sections of the <i>Istitutioni harmoniche</i> dedicated to
counterpoint (book 3) and the modes (book 4), preferring instead
to refer to intervals species (such as <i>quarta, quinta, diapason,
diatessaron</i>) when dealing with counterpoint and to letters
alone&mdash;with occasional reference to Greek pitch terminology, such
as <i>trite synemmenon</i>&mdash;when dealing with mode (he writes, for
instance, that &ldquo;The eleventh mode comes into being from the third
species of diapason, C to c, mediated harmonically by the note
G&rdquo;).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  On the other hand, in his <i>Dimostrationi harmoniche</i>
(1571) Zarlino did renumber the modes beginning with those ending
on C, instead of D, in such a way as to mirror the order of the
Guidonian syllables within the hexachord.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  In a similarly
ambiguous way, in his <i>Dodecachordon</i> (1547) Glareanus
customarily refers to the diatonic species of fourths and fifths
with Guidonian syllables, but he also indicates the pitch
boundaries of the twelve modes using either the seven letters
only, or the Greek pitch terminology (particularly in book 2,
chapters 1&ndash;37).  Furthermore, Glareanus often refers to pitches
by means of single letters in his numerous commentaries of
monophonic and polyphonic pieces (respectively in the chapters
mentioned above and in book 3, chapters 13&ndash;24).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>  On the other
hand, Glareanus also documents the presumably common practice of
naming the modes only with the Guidonian syllables ut, re, and mi.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>Thomas Morley, in his <i>A Plaine and Easie Introduction to
Practicall Musicke</i> (1597), explains the nuts and bolts of
Guidonian solmization at the very beginning of &ldquo;The First Part&rdquo;
of the treatise, which is significantly titled &ldquo;Teaching to
Sing,&rdquo; although the hexachordal syllables once again play only a
minimal role in the lengthy &ldquo;Second&rdquo; and &ldquo;Third&rdquo; parts of the
treatise dedicated to the teaching of various compositional
techniques.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  Morley <i>does</i> refer to the hexachordal syllables
in these later sections too, but these syllables&mdash;in the context
of Morley&rsquo;s treatise&mdash;seem to function as conventional
attachments to letter-names, rather than as signposts of some
underlying hexachordal structures.  Furthermore, it is
interesting to notice that in the &ldquo;Annotations&rdquo; to the &ldquo;First
Part&rdquo; of his treatise Morley inserts a passage that is slightly
critical of the Guidonian system.  He writes that Guido &ldquo;added a
fifth tetrachord [to the Greater Perfect System], including in
the scale (but not with such art and reason as the Greeks did)
seven hexachords or deductions of his six notes.&rdquo;  According to
Alec Harman, what Morley dislikes about the Guidonian system is
the &ldquo;uneven overlap&rdquo; of the seven hexachords when compared with
the linear simplicity of the Greater Perfect System.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Finally,
it could be argued that the Guidonian hexachord plays an all but
marginal role in the writings of Vicentino and Artusi.
<p>

[9] But in spite of the unclear status of the hexachord in
Renaissance theory, one may still acknowledge the possibility
that the Guidonian syllables, as Dr. Pike argues, could have been
used by composers as &ldquo;a means of communication&rdquo; with the
performers, as well as with those listeners who were at least
minimally familiar with the system.
<p>

[10] A good example of the way in which such a communication
would take place is provided by the opening measures of
Marenzio&rsquo;s madrigal &ldquo;Mi fa lasso languire,&rdquo; where the textual
incipit is made to correspond to the Guidonian syllables
mi&ndash;fa&ndash;la&ndash;sol&ndash;la&ndash;mi&ndash;re:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>mi</td>
		<td>fa</td>    
		<td>la</td>    
		<td>sol</td>   
		<td>la</td>   
		<td>mi</td>   
		<td>re</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

<p>Upon singing (or simply hearing) the notes E&ndash;F&ndash;a&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;a&ndash;E&ndash;D,
performers and (expert) listeners would immediately think of
(thus somehow also &ldquo;hear&rdquo;) the syllables mi&ndash;fa&ndash;la&ndash;sol&ndash;la&ndash;mi&ndash;re
and appreciate the wit of the correspondence between these
syllables and the first verse of the madrigal.  In this way, the
Guidonian hexachord adds an extra layer of meaning to the musical
setting of a poetic text.  For Dr. Pike, this technique of text
setting by means of &ldquo;hexachord sounds&rdquo; was more common than
scholars thus far have suspected, and many of his examples are
dedicated to illustrating this point.
<p>

[11] It is of course true that Renaissance musicians enjoyed
&ldquo;extracting&rdquo; musical subjects from the syllables of the text, as
several compositions with <i>soggetti cavati</i> or <i>fatti sulle
vocali</i> demonstrate.  In these cases, however, the syllables of
the text are normally made to correspond with the most obvious
solmization of the passage, so as not to leave any doubt about
the composer&rsquo;s intentions.  Unfortunately, Dr. Pike extends this
kind of interpretation to cases in which the correspondences
between textual syllables and hexachordal sounds appear to be all
but accidental.  Even more problematic are those cases in which
Dr. Pike takes the textual syllables to be the primary indicator
of the hexachordal position of the corresponding notes.  For
example, Dr. Pike&rsquo;s solmization of the opening of Frescobaldi&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Se la doglia e&rsquo;l martire&rdquo; (1608) is as follows:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">CANTUS</td>

<p>
Here Dr. Pike is concerned with associating the article &ldquo;la&rdquo; of
the text with the &ldquo;la&rdquo; of the hexachord.  As a consequence, he
reads the first two notes of the Cantus as part of a D hexachord
(D&ndash;E&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;G&ndash;A&ndash;B), presumably followed by a mutation to the G
hexachord (G&ndash;A&ndash;B&ndash;C&ndash;D&ndash;E); in a similar way, he interprets the
first two notes of the Altus as part of an A hexachord
(A&ndash;B&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;D&ndash;E&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>) that soon mutates into the C hexachord
(C&ndash;D&ndash;E&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;A) on the first G.  Needless to say, this strategy
flies in the face of customary rules of solmization.  Singers
were taught to select the correct hexachord on the ground of the
intervals to sing, not of the syllables to pronounce; in other
words, reducing the number of mutations was no doubt preferable
to maximizing the concordances between the two kinds of
syllables&mdash;indeed the choice was not even an issue.  One of the
most common rules of solmization, for example, dictated that
singers choose the syllables ut, re, and mi for singing ascending
intervals and fa, sol, la for singing descending ones.  It is
simply not a good idea to solmize the first note of an ascending
scale on sol or la&mdash;no matter what the corresponding textual
syllable is&mdash;because doing so forces a singer to perform
unnecessary mutations.  By the same token, it is unlikely that
performers would start Marenzio&rsquo;s (or Monteverdi&rsquo;s) &ldquo;Cruda
Amarilli&rdquo; on ut simply because of the assonance with &ldquo;Cru-,&rdquo; as
Dr. Pike suggests (pp. 143; 163).  Instead, it seems plausible to
assume that these singers, having internalized the standard rules
of solmization, would instinctively select one of the descending
syllables, since all of their parts begin with a descending
interval.
<p>

[12] But the analysis of Frescobaldi&rsquo;s madrigal is problematic in
other ways.  Dr. Pike suggests that, by introducing &ldquo;hexachords
on the sharp side of durum&mdash;on D and A,&rdquo; Frescobaldi provides a
musical image of the &ldquo;harshness of &lsquo;martire&rsquo;.&rdquo; Dr. Pike also
speculates that &ldquo;The performers are unlikely to miss the point,
though it is doubtful if non-performing listeners (should there
be any) would be likely to understand.&rdquo; Indeed, the ability to
appreciate this musical image of &ldquo;harshness&rdquo; seems to rest on
some notion of absolute pitch, i.e., on the listeners&rsquo;
realization that the first two notes of the Cantus belong to the
hexachord on D and not, for example, to the one on C.  Even
acknowledging this possibility, I see no reason to believe that
the second syllable of the text would lead performers and
listeners to mentally process the first two notes of their parts
as belonging to a diatonic structure that begins a fifth below.
It seems plausible, for example, that an hexachordally trained
listener would understand the first two notes of the Altus (E&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>)
as the re and mi of the D hexachord established by the Cantus,
again following the principle of economy of mutation.
<p>

[13] To give Dr. Pike&rsquo;s solmization the benefit of the doubt also
raises the issue of the significance of the rather different
hexachordal changes that take place in the two parts after the
second note: whereas the Cantus mutates to the next adjacent
hexachord on the &ldquo;flat&rdquo; side, on G, the Altus mutates from the
three-times-durus A hexachord to the natural C hexachord (perhaps
a case of &ldquo;remote mutation?&rdquo;).  Thus, the theory that hexachords
possessed &ldquo;strong&rdquo; cognitive implications for Renaissance
performers and listeners soon forces us to reconsider the very
notion of polyphonic imitation: can we still maintain that the
segment E&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;G in the Altus imitates the segment A&ndash;B&ndash;C of the
Cantus at the fourth below, if it turns out that the two
head-motives mutate to different levels of the hexachordal circle
of fifths?
<p>

[14] Dr. Pike should have considered the possibility that
Frescobaldi used counterpoint, rather than the melodic shape of
the individual parts, in order to illustrate the &ldquo;harshness of
&lsquo;martiri&rsquo;.&rdquo;  This alternative may sound obvious, but it is hard
not to associate the double dissonance (seventh + dim. fifth) at
the incipit of measure 2 and the clash of second in the middle of
the same measure with the &ldquo;pain and torture&rdquo; of the text, just as
it is difficult not to believe that at least the educated
listeners of the Renaissance would have appreciated the musical
significance of such events.  Indeed, the repercussions of two
dissonant intervals on the slightly awkward syllable &ldquo;-glia e&rsquo;l&rdquo;
in measure 2&mdash;the tongue ever pushes on the aching tooth&mdash;make
Frescobaldi&rsquo;s strategy all the more clear.
<p>

[15] To emphasize the structural role of counterpoint, however,
means necessarily to downplay the cognitive significance of the
Guidonian hexachord.  Taken as basic diatonic structures, the two
systems can hardly have been equally relevant to Renaissance
listeners because they operate in two different kinds of musical
space and thus may have triggered different kinds of sound
processing.  On the one hand, the rules of counterpoint operate
in a cyclical space that stretches without seams from the lowest
to the highest pitch (and vice versa), and that is expressed by
the seven letter names.  From the point of view of this musical
space, the hexachord is an all but marginal element.  Indeed, the
labels customarily attached to it by medieval and Renaissance
theorists when dealing with intervals and counterpoint (<i>diapente
cum tono, diatessaron con ditono, exaden maior</i>) reflect its
status as a derivative segment, less perfect than the octave, the
fifth, and the fourth.
<p>

[16] On the other hand, the Guidonian system outlines primarily a
segmented musical space where each pitch is assigned to one or
more overlapping and discrete sets of six elements.  In this case
it is the octave that appears as a derivative segment because two
pitches an octave apart belong necessarily to two different
hexachords (though they may still correspond to the same
syllable).  Instead, as Dr. Pike points out, the determining
factor in the Guidonian system is the central position of the
semitone mi&ndash;fa within each segment.  It is true that the strong
presence of the Guidonian syllables in medieval and Renaissance
music treatises seems to indicate that the centrality of the
semitone within the hexachord must have had unequivocal
implications for contemporary listeners.  To use Dr. Pike&rsquo;s
words, &ldquo;The symmetry of the system, with each hexachord revolving
around its most characteristic interval, must have appealed
strongly to the Medieval and Renaissance mind&rdquo; (p. 13).  However,
the hexachordal space is also, in a way, cyclical, although each
cycle (say, from mi to mi) begins in one segment and ends in
another and encompasses only four or five <i>voces</i>.  Thus it remains
to be determined whether for Renaissance listeners the symmetry
and the <i>length</i> of the hexachord were cognitively more relevant
than the <i>position</i> of the hexachords within the system of
<i>musica recta</i> (a fourth, a fifth, or an octave from each other),
or rather the other way around.  In relation to this question, it
should be noted that Guidonian solmization was a practical
application of the medieval theory of <i>affinitas</i> at the fifth
between the pitches of the gamut.  As to the cognitive weight of
the theory of affinity at the fifth, it was probably not a heavy
one, to judge from chapter 9 of Guido&rsquo;s <i>Micrologus</i>, titled
&ldquo;Also on the resemblance of notes, which is perfect only at the
diapason.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup><p>

[17] Because one of Dr. Pike&rsquo;s primary interests is to show how
late-Renaissance composers used solmization to illustrate the
meaning (or the sound) of the text, his analyses tend to focus
on the horizontal, rather than the vertical, aspect of this
repertory.  Occasionally, he does take into account the
contrapuntal relations between the voices (for example, in his
discussion of various settings of &ldquo;Mia benigna fortuna&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Crudele acerba&rdquo; by Arcadelt, Rore, and Lasso)&mdash;again for the
main purpose of understanding the music as an image of the text.
In these pages, however, the presence of the hexachord as a
&ldquo;basic structure&rdquo; seems to fade away, substituted by a more
conventional focus on the dynamics of consonance and dissonance
or on mode.  A more detailed discussion of how counterpoint and
the modes relate to the hexachord, conceived as a basic diatonic
structure, would have clarified the ways in which the two
horizontal and vertical approaches pursued in the book support
each other.
<p>

[18] There are several points in the book at which such a
discussion would have been appropriate.  In the introduction, for
example, the reader will find frequent references to the
differences between modality and tonality and to the role of
chromaticism in the dissolution of the modal and the hexachordal
systems, but there is no treatment of the functional relation
between the modes and the Guidonian <i>voces</i> (p. 3).  In a similar
way, the later section on &ldquo;Hexachords&rdquo; seems to have no bearing
on the previous presentation of the modal system (pp. 13&ndash;16). Yet
the very nature of Dr. Pike&rsquo;s argument warrants a discussion of
these functional relations: does mode establish hexachord, or
does hexachord establish mode, and how?  Is one necessarily the
correlate of the other, and why?  How do hexachordal scale degrees
relate to modal scale degrees?  For example, how important is it
that in the cases of the Protus and Deuterus modes the <i>finalis</i>
does not fall on the first degree of the hexachord? How important
is it that it does in other modes? How significant was the fact
that at least one of the modal constituents, the second species
of fifth E&ndash;b, &ldquo;embodied&rdquo; an hexachordal mutation?  Finally, a
discussion is needed on the extent to which a melodic structure
such as hexachord can account for the polyphonic complex of a
piece&mdash;a problem that scholars have often raised about mode.
<p>

[19] To be sure, Dr. Pike does explore hexachord in the context
of mode in the section &ldquo;Hexachord Color,&rdquo; in the chapter &ldquo;Voces
Musicales I,&rdquo; where he argues that late-Renaissance composers
were able to broaden their tonal palette by transposing the
hexachord either to the &ldquo;mollis&rdquo; or to the &ldquo;durus&rdquo; side in an
attempt to make their music more suitable to express the
emotional colors of the text.  We are told that, because the
molle hexachord was &ldquo;colored&rdquo; by the B flat, &ldquo;it was thought of
as &lsquo;soft&rsquo; or &lsquo;sweet&rsquo;, and so it was particularly appropriate for
the illustration of sweetness or similar ideas&rdquo; (p. 32).  Later
in this section Dr. Pike explains that &ldquo;All transposition of
sixteenth-century polyphonic modes was by a fourth up (adding one
flat to the key signature) or by a seventh up (adding two flats):
this accurately reflects the fundamental notes of the three
hexachords&rdquo; (p. 33).
<p>

[20] The idea of &ldquo;hexachord color,&rdquo; though, is problematic.  It
is not clear which theorists Dr. Pike has in mind when he argues
that the flat hexachord &ldquo;was thought of&rdquo; as &ldquo;&lsquo;soft&rsquo; or &lsquo;sweet&rsquo;,&rdquo;
but the fact remains that theoretical discussions of musical
affects and the relationship between text and music in the
Renaissance are centered on mode, not on hexachord.  I am aware
of no music theorist who directly links the &ldquo;three properties of
singing&rdquo; (<i>per natura, per B quadro</i>, and <i>per B molle</i>, which
modern scholars&mdash;somewhat erroneously&mdash;are used to calling
natural, soft, and hard hexachords) to the expression of
&ldquo;softness,&rdquo; &ldquo;harshness,&rdquo; and the like.  Equally unsubstantiated
is the claim that common patterns of transposition in the
Renaissance follow a hexachordal scheme.  On the one hand, the
very notion of &ldquo;hexachordal transposition&rdquo; is
not easily found in musical treatises from the Renaissance,
if by &ldquo;hexachord&rdquo; one means a diatonic segment of six
pitches, rather than a series of six pitch names.  On the other
hand, theorists quite understandably presented
modal transposition and modal change as the result
of a swapping of the constituent diatonic species,
not&mdash;most emphatically&mdash;in hexachordal terms.  In some cases,
humanistically inclined theorists would discuss these issues in
reference to the Greek tetrachords.  Book IV, ch. 16, of
Zarlino&rsquo;s <i>Istitutioni harmoniche</i>, for example, carries the
following characteristically verbose title: &ldquo;Whether by removing
the tetrachord diezeugmenon [B&ndash;C&ndash;D&ndash;E] from any composition and
putting in its place the synemmenon [A&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;C&ndash;D] while the other
tetrachords remain immovable, one mode can be changed into
another.&rdquo;  It should be mentioned that not a single Guidonian
syllable appears either in this chapter or in the following one
on the &ldquo;Transposition of Modes.&rdquo;
<p>

[21] Dr. Pike neglects to mention that mode maintained its
character and affect regardless of transposition, although it is
also true that composers would introduce flat or sharp sonorities
for affective or rhetorical reasons&mdash;such as madrigalisms&mdash;as
illustrated in some of Dr. Pike&rsquo;s analyses.  Certain specific
notes, or chords, may have signalled a particular affect even
when considered in isolation; still, much of the affective flavor
of these notes or chords depends on the intervallic or harmonic
context in which they occur.  Once again, Zarlino is able to cast
some light on this issue.  In the famous chapter where he divides
the fifth to generate the &ldquo;major&rdquo; and the &ldquo;minor&rdquo; chords, he is
careful to point out that the different character of the two
combinations is given not by the nature of the intervals
involved, but rather by the <i>position</i> of the two thirds within
the fifth.  It is worth quoting Zarlino&rsquo;s passage in full: &ldquo;While
the extremes of the fifth are invariable and always in the same
ratio<nobr>, . . . </nobr>the extremes of the thirds are placed differently within
the fifth.  I do not mean that such thirds differ in proportion
but in location<nobr> . . . </nobr>when the major third is below, the harmony is
gay, and when it is above, the harmony is sad.  <i>So from these
diverse positions of the thirds placed in counterpoint between
the extremes of the fifth&mdash;or above the octave&mdash;comes harmonic
variety</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>  
It seems to me that Zarlino&rsquo;s argument can easily
be applied to Dr. Pike&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;hexachordal color.&rdquo; Granted
that the hexachord (read: major sixth) may contain pitches that
are &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; <i>per se</i>, it is also important to consider its
position within the octave.  In other words, it seems that the
affective connotations of the &ldquo;molle hexachord&rdquo; depend a great
deal on whether the mi&ndash;fa semitone (A&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) falls between the first
two pitches of the mode, or rather between the third and fourth
pitches&mdash;nor is it recommended to disregard the location of the
other semitone within the octave.
<p>

[22] Thus we are confronted with the same problem that I have
already discussed above, namely, how to accommodate Dr. Pike&rsquo;s
&ldquo;strong&rdquo; view of the hexachord as a basic cognitive structure
with other normative systems that took the octave as their ruler,
such as mode.  One cannot emphasize the latter without relegating
the former to a marginal role.  Yet too often Dr. Pike gives the
impression that he is trying to have it both ways.  In his
analysis of J.P. Sweelinck&rsquo;s keyboard fantasy on the theme <i>Ut,
re, mi, fa, sol, la a 4 voci</i>, for example, he claims that the
piece is based &ldquo;around the F hexachord (F major), though a number
of statements move to naturale&rdquo; (p. 208).  But the concepts of &ldquo;F
hexachord&rdquo; and &ldquo;F major&rdquo; seem mutually exclusive, rather than
interchangeable: to argue that the piece is based &ldquo;around the F
hexachord&rdquo; implies that the pitch E is somehow outside the main
structural element, whereas this is obviously not the case from
the perspective of a reading of the piece in &ldquo;F major,&rdquo;
&ldquo;transposed Ionian,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fifth mode.&rdquo;  In the ensuing discussion,
Dr. Pike highlights Sweelinck&rsquo;s ability in creating a sense of
climax by carefully balancing ascending and descending statements
of the hexachords on C, F, and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> with frequent overlaps.  From a
tonal point of view, however, it is also interesting to observe
that these statements of the subject occur in ever changing
contrapuntal contexts, sometimes starting from the fifth of the
mode, sometimes on the finalis.  Furthermore, the subject in its
various expositions may be articulated sometimes as a <i>diapente
cum tono</i>, sometimes as a <i>tonus cum diapente</i>, and sometimes
even as a <i>diatessaron con ditono</i>.  Again, the structural weight
of the hexachordal subject cannot be considered independently of
the <i>position</i> of that subject within the octave.  Whereas
contemporary listeners would certainly understand each
presentation of the subject as beginning on some ut or la, it is
difficult not to imagine that they would also hear those subjects
as modally located on, say, the final or the confinal.  Dr. Pike
seems to believe that a Renaissance listener, upon hearing ut on
the fifth of the mode, would still process that sound as the
first scale degree of the corresponding hexachord.  However, we
cannot rule out the possibility that some listeners would assign
cognitive priority to that pitch heard as the fifth of the mode,
while realizing that it also coincides with the lowest note of
the subject.
<p>

[23] In conclusion, Dr. Pike&rsquo;s study&mdash;in spite of the valuable
insights into the repertory that it offers&mdash;is problematic not
only because the hypothesis of a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; hexachord creates more
problems than it resolves, but also because of a more general
methodological weakness: in his attempt to capture what is
&ldquo;hidden,&rdquo; &ldquo;abstruse,&rdquo; and &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; in late-Renaissance
music by relying almost exclusively on unmediated analyses of
musical scores, Dr. Pike reaches conclusions that too often seem
self-confirming.  On the one hand, the subtleties of musical
structure that he brings to light through musical analysis are to
account for the experience of listening of the Renaissance
<i>cognoscenti</i>; on the other hand, unconfirmed hypotheses about
the listening skills and mental musical processes of the
<i>cognoscenti</i> are supposed to justify the validity of the
analyses.  But the historical question of the relevance of
Guidonian solmization for Renaissance composers cannot be
answered satisfactorily through music analysis alone; instead, a
much wider perspective is required, in which a variety of
historical, theoretical, and cognitive issues about the origin,
transmission, and function of the Guidonian system are brought to
bear on one another.  In particular, the often made facile
equation of hexachord as a pedagogical tool and hexachord as a
cognitive structure needs to be placed under intense critical
scrutiny.  It may turn out that hexachord, far from being the key
element of a distinct musical language, was little more than a
local inflection within the long history of Western diatonic
music.</p>
