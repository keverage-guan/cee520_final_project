<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1]   The 1996 spring threads on the smt-list  
included an extensive
discussion of appropriate texts for twentieth-century
analysis. Consensus emerged that the recent books of Lester, Kostka,
Straus, and Morgan represent the most-used texts in the area. The
first three are reviewed by Wennerstrom, who references Morgan with
Simms and Watkins, as books that &ldquo;attempt[s] the complete
stylistic/historical coverage<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  My writing below details my
findings of the first four authors&rsquo; exclusion of women&rsquo;s compositions,
some postulations for women&rsquo;s exclusion, and closes with a
supplementary list of compositions by women, with associated
readings.  As coordinator of spring 1996 
fourth-semester theory (the
time period during which we introduce twentieth-century techniques) I
reexamined these books to decide which one to recommend as a text for
this coming fall. In a recently published review,<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> I stated my reservations to a music fundamentals package because of its exclusion
of works by women and composers of ethnicities, so I paid particular
attention to women&rsquo;s compositions presented for study in the
twentieth-century texts. This area is disappointingly incomplete, as
detailed below through summary of the books in chronological order of
publication.  None of these four books presents a score written by a
woman during the twentieth century, at least none that I could find. <p>


[2]  In Lester&rsquo;s <i>Analytic Approaches to 
Twentieth-Century Music</i>,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> I can find only one reference to a woman composer: On page 234, he makes
reference to an article by Elaine Barkin. Lester&rsquo;s omission of women&rsquo;s
scores is particularly puzzling, in light of his supportive invited
presentation to a 1995 session organized by the Society for Music
Theory Committee on the Status of Women at the New York conference.

<p>



[3]  Stefan Kostka, previous to his 1990 book 
discussed here, has
coauthored with Dorothy Payne, a well-known woman theorist.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Kostka
references Laurie Anderson (page 317), Robin Mortimore (page 308), Pauline
Oliveros (page  308), and Joan Tower (page 171), but provides no scores by
any of these composers. In the bibliography, he references writings by
Gail de Stwolinsky, Robert Cogan and Pozzi Escot (a well-known woman
composer), Louise and Jeane Gareipy, Sarah Reid, Janet Schmalfeldt,
and Ludmila Ulehla.<p>

[4]  Joseph Straus&rsquo; <i>Introduction to Post-Tonal 
Theory</i><sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> is a book
we have used previously for our twentieth-century segment of fourth
semester.  It provided no references to women composers, although
Professor Straus has been remarkably supportive of women composers
through his research, publications, and activities, such as editing of
a collection of musical examples by women initiated by the Society for
Music Theory Committee on the Status of Women and in collaboration
with a number of other scholars (please see list of references for
full citation).
<p>


[5]  <i>Twentieth-Century Music</i>, by Robert 
Morgan,<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> contains the most
extensive references to women composers, but no scores. On page xvii,
he mentions talking with Shulamit Ran and Ellen Harris. He references
Tailleferre (page 162), and illustrates and discusses Laurie Anderson
(pages 418&ndash;419), Berberian (pages 444 and 447), and Boulanger
(pages 283&ndash;284, 286, 287, and 397). In addition, he mentions Carolyn
Brown (page 363), Trisha Brown (page 418), Rene Char (page 384), poet Alice
Goodman (page 450), Agnes de Mille and Martha Graham (page 290), has an
illustration showing women performers on page 451, and one on page 335
identifying Yvonne Loriod as pianist and wife of Messiaen. Oliveros is
referenced on pages 444, 456, and 483; her composition <i>Sonic
Meditations</i> is referenced on page 454; <i>Sound Patterns</i> is 
referenced
on page 444. On page 486, Morgan wrote: &ldquo;Many gifted women are also
contributing significantly to the contemporary musical scene. Zwilich,
Tower, Musgrave, Jolas, and Gubaidulina might be mentioned as
representative of a group that, at least in the younger generation,
approaches parity in size and importance with its male counterpart.&rdquo;
<p>


[6]  I know all four of these theorists, and admire their professional
accomplishments. To confirm my research, I sent a preliminary draft of
this manuscript to all of them, and have received
detailed replies from each of them.  They seemed as surprised as I,
pointing out their attention to women&rsquo;s compositions in other areas of
their published work.<p>

[7]  Morgan&rsquo;s email contains this excerpt: &ldquo;I was 
appalled to discover
that I did not even mention Ruth Crawford, who was such a wonderful
composer!  I can&rsquo;t imagine how that happened. I have even written
about her elsewhere.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><p>


[8]  Joel Lester&rsquo;s email reads in part: &ldquo;My memory tells me that your
survey of my index is accurate.  The criteria I used in assembling
pieces to analyze in my twentieth-century book included the following:
that the pieces were widely available in scores and recordings, and
that there was a tradition of analyzing them (so that I as teacher had
access to numerous theorists&rsquo; ideas about them). The first criterion
was, of course, the most important to me, as it would have been silly
to have published a text aimed at a wide audience if the music being
analyzed were not available in many colleges/schools of music,
etc<nobr>. . .</nobr> My other activities in 
twentieth-century music included 22
years as a member of Da Capo Chamber Players&mdash;a group that performed
the works of hundreds of twentieth century (mostly, but far from
exclusively, American) composers<nobr>. . .</nobr> A very substantial percentage
of those works were by women composers; indeed, one recurring theme in
Da Capo programs was works by women composers&mdash;including concerts
entirely dedicated to the works of single women composers.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup><p>


[9]  Something inexplicable had occurred, considering the work of the
Committee on the Status of Women of the Society for Music Theory,
whose first meeting was held at the 1986 conference at Indiana
University before the publication of these books. The meeting was
attended by a number of men theorists. Women composers and their music
constitute a large and expanding segment of twentieth-century
literature. Omission of this group calls for examination of the
cultural climate in which the omission occurred and consideration of
additional causes.<p>

[10]  Those who have read my previous writings on feminist music
theories know that I try to avoid simplistic binary oppositions,
recognizing their inevitable referentiality in such words as &ldquo;binary,&rdquo;
&ldquo;opposition,&rdquo; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; and &ldquo;or.&rdquo; I attempt to relate theoretical
concepts along multidimensional continua of completion, rather than to
make judgments of right or wrong.  This construction allows me to
retain a shred of previous objectivist research methodologies, which
posit that facts are true only until proved false and that hypotheses
can be tested for applicability and generalizability.<p>

[11]  I propose three possible causes of the omission of women&rsquo;s
compositions from the books of these four authors. The first centers
on Margolis&rsquo; <i>Patterns, Thinking, and Cognition</i>, the second on 
some
of Foucault&rsquo;s concepts in <i>Madness and Civilization</i> and 
<i>Discipline
and Punish</i>, and the third on recent history of U.S. music theory and
composition.  Although a number of women philosophers, such as Daly
and de Lauretis&rsquo; work could be used, my examination of the problem
through the prism of significant male philosophers&rsquo; views offers a
more balanced approach.<p>

[12]  Definitions of music and theories are multiple but generally
include concepts of music as patterned sound and theory as a method of
seeking to determine these patterns.  Margolis detailed his analysis
of pattern cognition within cultural contexts.  His analysis is useful
for pattern cognition implicit in music&rsquo;s composition and analysis.
Margolis argued for a pattern-seeking, pattern-dominated cognition,
which he defined as &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> all of cognition consists of being cued
(not consciously of course) to whatever pattern we first find that
satisfies the situation&rdquo; (page 40). In addition, he 
proposed a continuum
of cognitive entrenchment, as exemplified by the Copernican
revolution: &ldquo;[I]t was only after a complete turning of generations
.. that we reach people free enough of the older habits of mind for
the [Copernican] contagion to reach the stage of social knowledge.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> The book ended with a close reading of Galileo&rsquo;s trial and conviction by the Inquisition during the reign of Pope Urban VIII,
taking into account that Galileo and Urban were good friends.  Although
others of his time privately supported Galileo&rsquo;s stance that the earth
moved around the sun, the political climate of ideas and perceptions
was such that Galileo had to make public recantation of what most
serious scholars believed privately.  Margolis summarized that,
&ldquo;Political polarization stimulates cognitive polarization,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> and that the intensity of the polarization will depend on the degree of balance of the various points of view: if the balance is one-sided,
supporters of the dominant view will have little incentive to see
things in a balanced way.  Margolis concluded that cognitive
perception is intrinsic to cultural parameters and to human political
behavior.  Although his concepts can be applied to contemporary music
theorists&rsquo; need to ignore works by women composers, his reasoning
assumes that all of his protagonists are equally committed to
defending their cognitive and political concepts. All of his examples
are males. His description of the societal angst caused by the
Copernican revolution may have even greater applications to
controversies arising from the inclusion of women and minorities in
college textbooks. Minorities, by simple definition, have fewer
advocates than the majority. Culturally, women have been less inclined
to insist on representation equivalent to men in texts, as evidenced
by the exclusion of women&rsquo;s compositions from the texts described
here.
<p>

[13]  Margolis&rsquo; theories need additions to 
account for acculturated
differences in groups. Research by Gilligan, Ruddick and others has
shown that U.S. women are culturally conditioned to avoid conflict and
to seek conflict resolution.  For example, Gilligan advocated that &ldquo;an
ethic of care rests on the premise of nonviolence&mdash;that no one should
be hurt.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup>  Ruddick summarized, &ldquo;All participants resist others&rsquo;
violence and their own temptations to abandon or assault, persisting
in relationships that include anger, disappointment, difference,
conflict, and nonviolent battle.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>  Women may be reluctant to
participate in the heated verbal and printed exchanges that have
occurred in the dialectics defining compositional practices and their
appropriate theoretical approaches. Many women composers and theorists
display these characteristics. The verbal violence of some of these
exchanges is relished by some of the participants, but may be
frightening to others.  In addition, when women 
composers and
theorists do attempt to participate in these exchanges, our colleagues
may perceive us as operating outside the traditional cultural roles of
women and discount our opinions.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>  Although trained through androcentric university traditions in the musical and intellectual
crossdressing of defending our cognitive concepts, some of our primary
acculturation remains and is reinforced by the popular culture in
which we participate.

<p>


[14]  These cultural patterns of conflict resolution may restrain us
from being advocates of equal strength for our music and theories. We
are culturally predisposed to seek resolution of verbal conflicts and
are not our own best advocates for our music. This complicates
consideration of women&rsquo;s music. Men theorists and composers are
culturally trained to compete, to make their best cases for their own
compositions and theories.  They can become impatient with women who
retain conflict-averting cognitive patterns. On the other hand, both
men and women can be startled by women who have adapted their
cognitive styles to those more expected of men, or by men who have
chosen to adopt conflict-avoidance styles. Cognitive styles which lack
cultural recognition, when used in group communication, whether the
communication is musical, verbal, or written, complicate group
consideration of these different cognitive paradigms.  Groups and
their individual members may be left in a state of confusion and
unease by unfamiliar perceptual and communicative modes.  This can
complicate the communication and cooperation between women and men
members of the same profession, through political polarization within
our discipline. We work in a continuum of cultural sites and
perceptions; not all women consider themselves feminists and not all
feminists are women.<p>

[15]  Margolis&rsquo; description of Galileo&rsquo;s conviction and silencing by
the Inquisition provides an extreme example of political polarization
around a conceptual paradigm change.  There are musical analogues: as
undergraduates, we learn to include Germaine Tailleferre as one of
&ldquo;Les Six.&rdquo; Yet well over half of her compositions are still
unpublished and unavailable for any analytical judgment.  Her
compositional relationship to &ldquo;Les Six&rdquo; thus remains analytically
undeterminable.  The absence of women&rsquo;s compositions from
twentieth-century theory texts does not require that we round up for a
contemporary Inquisition &ldquo;the usual suspects&rdquo; (to paraphrase one of
the last scenes in the movie &ldquo;Casablanca&rdquo;) of women composers excluded
and demand their credentials for inclusion: perhaps alphabetically
from Laurie Anderson to Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. However, their erasure
from our analytical literature makes theories of another
twentieth-century analyst, Foucault, relevant to our reflection.<p>

[16]  My previous description of the text 
authors&rsquo; surprise at their
omission of women&rsquo;s compositions can be related to Foucault&rsquo;s
explication of the purpose of punishment: &ldquo;the 
penalty should be
carried out in secret; the public was to intervene neither as a
witness, nor as a guarantor of punishment&rdquo;;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> &ldquo;the perfect image of prison labour was the women&rsquo;s workshop at Clairvaus; the silent
precision of the human machinery is reminiscent of the regulated
rigour of the convent&rdquo;;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> and &ldquo;a 
certain significant generality
moved between the least irregularity and the greatest crime; it was no
longer the offence, the attack on the common interest, it was the
departure from the norm, the anomaly.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Foucault&rsquo;s writings
defined a culture&rsquo;s need to disguise and hide the mechanics of
punishment from the cultural world at large. What better cultural
punishment with its secret precision as defined by Foucault, can be
devised (however unintentional) for women composers, than to ignore
their work in the books which the theoretical community designates as
central to learning twentieth-century compositional and theoretical
techniques?

<p>

[17]  The historical relegation of women to a private sphere and many
women&rsquo;s consideration of such relegation to punishment has been
documented by Spacks<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> and by 
Armstrong,<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> among others.  Music
plays a central cultural role in religious ritual; silencing of women
continues as a doctrine among a number of religions.  Women composers,
who have chosen to break these traditions with creation of organized
sound performed in public, are so deeply criminalized by the
centralities of our culture as to make the quotation of their music in
a theory text nearly a crime in itself. How can we be surprised at the
exclusion of women&rsquo;s compositions from textbooks?

<p>

[18]  Additional reasons for exclusion of women&rsquo;s compositions from
20th-century analytical texts can be deduced from Foucault&rsquo;s <i>Madness
and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</i>, where
he stipulates: &ldquo;Long after the diseases of the poor had again become
an affair of state, the asylum would keep the insane in the imperative
fiction of the family&rdquo;;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> and 
&ldquo;Confinement, prisons, dungeons, even
tortures, engaged in a mute dialogue between reason and unreason are
the dialogue of struggle. This dialogue itself 
was now disengaged;
silence was absolute; there was no longer any common language between
madness and reason.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup>  Silence, 
culturally accepted for a group of
some of its members (as is the case for women in many subcultures),
militates against strong support of what that group might say. Does
acceptance of such silencing advance the presence of women&rsquo;s
compositions in contemporary culture?  The question of why there are
no great women composers is still heard occasionally and is provided
with radically incomplete answers. Women&rsquo;s compositions are omitted
from our field&rsquo;s most popular texts on twentieth-century music.  Does
their authors being men increase the probability of women&rsquo;s exclusion
from subsequent editions?

<p>

[19]  The last half century&rsquo;s importance of reason and mathematics to
analytical systems centered on twelve-tone and set theory may provide
an implicit basis for ignoring women&rsquo;s compositions which might be
well served through use of such analysis.  Do we exclude analyses of
women&rsquo;s compositions because culturally we do not relate them to such
objective analytical contexts?  Even Lewin (a strong supporter of
women) has written an analysis of Babbitt&rsquo;s <i>Philomel</i> in which he
describes the actions of the raped and mutilated woman: &ldquo;Nothing lies
<i>closer</i> to her than the laborious work of composing her piece,
through Babbitt as a medium. In that manner alone can she portray her
being, and make known her sufferings. To sing Babbitt&rsquo;s piece is to
weave her tapestry.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Does the 
metaphor of tapestry weaving show us a
woman giving public reasoned testimony of her wrongs, or of a woman
confined to reveal her agonies in a culturally-approved private space
through the repetitive physical actions required to make a tapestry?
What roles of equivalent independence and joy have been recognized in
women&rsquo;s composition and analyzed by men theorists?  What analyses by
men theorists celebrate strength, logic and happiness in the music of
women?

<p>


[20]  Could exemplifying analysis through 
compositions by women, who
are defined by our culture to embody illogic, constitute an implicitly
inappropriate pedagogical approach?  Wennerstrom&rsquo;s review previously
cited notes that the books she reviewed concentrated on twelve-tone
and set theory. Are women composers still faced with Gilman&rsquo;s
situation as recounted in her short story, &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper&rdquo;&mdash;a
disguised autobiographical account&mdash;of a woman writer driven to
madness by her &ldquo;rest cure&rdquo; that required that she never write again?<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Has the explicit cultural imperative of Gilman&rsquo;s time become
implicit for today&rsquo;s women composers&mdash;that they should cease writing
music and dismiss any possibilities of their music being included in
analysis?  What analyses have been published in music theory journals,
written by men theorists about compositions by women, utilizing
twelve-tone and set theory?  There are multiple examples of the
converse: women theorists, in their published analyses, have dutifully
and skillfully applied current analytical techniques to men&rsquo;s
compositions.  Would there have been such outrage against McClary&rsquo;s
analyses if she had centered on women&rsquo;s compositions, instead of the
&ldquo;canonized&rdquo; men&rsquo;s compositions which she frequently analyses?
Omission of women composers from twentieth-century texts is likely to
be attributable to multiple causes arising within the field.  Adrienne
Rich&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;the dream of a common language,&rdquo; still holds
attraction for women musicians as did its choice as the theme of the
first conference on Feminist Theory and Music, held in 1991.  We still
hope for the possibility of musical creations of both women and men
being considered by us all.
 <p>


[21]  After World War II and the Korean War, many young men composers
went to college on the GI Bill.  Their subsequent return to academic
institutions as composers brought them back to places where they had
experienced freedom and growth. Babbitt strengthened their desire to
return, by calling for contemporary composition to center in academic
institutions: &ldquo;I dare suggest that the composer would do himself and
his music an immediate and eventual service by total, resolute and
voluntary withdrawal from this public world to one of private
performance and electronic media.  By so doing, the separation between
the domains would be defined beyond any possibility of confusion of
categories, and the composer would be free to pursue a private life of
professional achievement.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>  Men 
composers&rsquo; seeking private
academic lives coincided with decreases in the percentage of women as
members of university faculties, documented by Jessie Barnard.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> In
recent years, there is an increasing number of women and men
composers in comparison to the number of university positions
available.  Competition for these positions has become fierce.  What
effect does this competition have on men composer/theorists?  Does it
decrease their professional and cultural security, their likelihood
(however unintentional) of promoting and analyzing the works of women
composers?
<p>

[22]  The reduction in percentage of women on university faculties may
have had unintended consequences on the education of younger
contemporary composers and theorists, who may have had minimal
opportunities to study theory or composition with women
composers/theorists. For many current theorists, women composers have
not been available as teachers or as role models. Although these
theorists are aware of women as composers, their choice of
compositions to illustrate twentieth-century techniques would more
likely be drawn from their early role models and mentors. Theodore
noted the continuation of this reduced influence: &ldquo;The status of
academic women had remained virtually unchanged from 1970 to 1983
<nobr>. . .</nobr> and they barely were visible in the male-dominated academic
departments and professional schools, both public and private, large
and small.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>  This is quite a 
change from the late nineteenth
century belief that music was a womanly occupation, as documented by
Ives&rsquo; continual railing against effeminacy he thought that he detected
in compositions or performances.
<p>


[23]  Women have been displaced from their former musical centrality,
in which they were maintained by the millions of U.S. women of
multiple ethnicities who supported women composers through women&rsquo;s
organizations.  The organizations&rsquo; memberships decreased once the vote
had been won and women started working outside the home in larger
numbers, leaving less time for participation in women&rsquo;s organizations.
Ives was certainly not the only man to object to what he perceived as
feminine musical values and aesthetics. Freudian concepts of women&rsquo;s
innate indecisiveness (his question: &ldquo;What do women want?&rdquo; became a
mantra for much of the twentieth century). Similarly, women&rsquo;s
culturally-approved passivity as a sign of their mental health
oriented a large segment of the culture to perceptual cognition of men
as artistic creators and arbitors of musical analytic values.  The
cultural pattern is self-replicative through our university
educational system, and can be exemplified by the paucity of works by
twentieth-century women composers in commonly-used anthologies such as
Burkhart<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> (the 5th edition now 
includes one example by Crawford
Seeger).  Anthologies are 
so expensive that few undergraduate classes
require students to buy more than one. Anthologies of women composers&rsquo;
works, such as those by Briscoe<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> and by Straus,<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> are rarely
required as texts in undergraduate analysis courses. The works of
women composers well known by students from their performance
repertoire, written by composers such as Musgrave, Zwilich, Larsen,
Tower, and many others, are not used in theory classes. Students
develop an increased sense of alienation of the relationship of music
theory and music through omission of women&rsquo;s compositions from their
theoretical studies.

<p>
[24]  Based on the foregoing and on my previous 
writings,<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> I
consider twentieth-century texts providing compositions written
exclusively by men, to be radically incomplete. I acknowledge the
cultural basis of such a selection, but question whether it represents
the conscious decision of the majority of music theorists.  There is
considerable feminist theory in other fields that advocates a somewhat
different position within analytic traditions, such as Battersby&rsquo;s
<i>Gender and Genius</i>:<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> &ldquo;Men 
would not have insisted that creativity
is a male prerogative unless men were afraid that women&rsquo;s creations
would be taken seriously.&rdquo;

<p>

[25]  My summary invokes concepts of Korsyn, Ginsberg, and Christensen,
as well as aspects of poststructural feminism, which provide an
effective way to formulate relationships of women and music as the
site of multiple truths without acceding to a total relativity of
truths.  In 1987, Weedon wrote of this multiplicity: &ldquo;The meaning of
the signifier &lsquo;woman&rsquo; varies from ideal to victim to object of sexual
desire, according to its context.  Consequently, it is always open to
challenge and redefinition with shifts in its discursive
context<nobr>. . .</nobr>  However, a feminist 
poststructuralism must pay full
attention to the social and institutional context of textuality in
order to address the power relations of everyday life<nobr>. . .</nobr> Social
meanings are produced within social institutions and practices in
which individuals, who are shaped by these institutions, are agents of
change.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup>  Women musicians, in 
their multiply-overlapping roles of
composers, theorists, performers, and listeners, are change agents who
are shaped by cultural institutions and contexts.

<p>

[26]  Segments of poststructural theories, particularly those which
propose a multiplicity of truths, are useful in determining a place
for women&rsquo;s works, both musical and literary. The central truths
abstracted from the canon of men&rsquo;s works are not about to be replaced
by some &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; revision. I am not advocating
substitution of Bacewicz for Berg, Clarke for Cage, Shulamit Ran for
Stravinsky; I ask that our cognitive perception be extended to include
the former as well as the latter. If we can expand historically
accepted sources of musical concepts to include women&rsquo;s work as having
equal valence, we will have accomplished a great deal.  As Ginsberg
concluded: &ldquo;But one of the projects of American feminists has been to
claim our right to participate in the making of meaning.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup>  More
complete musical analytic truths (no matter how partial they remain)
will emerge from our inclusion of women&rsquo;s compositions in the music
that we analyze and help our students learn to analyze.

<p>
[27]  Both music theory and I as a theorist are expanding and changing
our methodologies.  In 1989, I first had the temerity to discuss with
a graduate student the question with which I had been concerned for
some time: What might constitute feminist music theories? His response
was, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what feminism and music theory might have in
common.&rdquo;  As Christensen wrote in 1993: &ldquo;Every 
composition exists
along a plurality of continuums: the composer&rsquo;s own artistic
development, the historical unfolding of a given genre or style,
evolving social and aesthetic forces, and so on.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> The pluralities of cognitive perceptions of music will continue to
increase.

<p>
[28]  Our students are ahead of their teachers now, and we might well
run to catch up with them. In this spirit, I propose one of many
possible supplementary study lists for an undergraduate one-semester
course on twentieth-century music analysis. This in no way proposes a
new canon. If I articulate a problem, feminist theories advocate that I
present a possible solution: I believe that the lack of women&rsquo;s
compositions used in our analysis texts is a significant problem. The
music and articles are a compilation relying on many with greater
expertise than I; most of my research and teaching have been in
sixteenth- and eighteenth-century music.  In responses to my email for
help, members of the International Alliance of Women Musicians&rsquo;
electronic discussion list produced far more music and references than
I can include here. Works included in the assignment list were chosen,
in large part, because I was able to find secondary literature to
assist in their analysis. A number of significant women composers,
including some of my personal favorites, are omitted because I could
find no secondary resources. I hope this will bring outcries of, &ldquo;How
could you have missed the article/book on X?&rdquo; The assignment list
needs expansion.<p>

[29]  Change in our professional endeavors is 
likely to be both
exhilarating and unsettling.  Korsyn has written of possible changes;
&ldquo;If analysis is to capture the rhetorical relationship between speaker
and audience <nobr>. . .</nobr> we may need to find new styles of writing about
music.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> Some will question 
whether my writing is an appropriate
method of framing the problem.  Nearly a decade 
ago, Anderson
discussed phases of curriculum change; my proposal here is both
partial and conservative, the sort often referred to as, &ldquo;add women
and stir.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> <p>


[30]  In the future, I hope that the amount of 
music by women composers
in our curricula more accurately mirrors the percentage of women who
study with us and go on to become professional musicians, frequently
including in their repertory a great deal of music written by women.
Curricula changes of this magnitude will discomfit many theorists in
the field today.  I take comfort in the words of bell hooks: &ldquo;If women
always seek to avoid confrontation, to always be &lsquo;safe,&rsquo; we may never
experience any revolutionary change, any transformation, individually
or collectively.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> Can her words 
be extended to women&rsquo;s
compositions and to feminist music theories as well? Music theory
needs to develop cognitive patterns past a silencing of women
composers.  Addition of women&rsquo;s compositions to twentieth-century
analytical texts can aid us all. <p>
<p>
<h3>SUPPLEMENTAL TWENTIETH-CENTURY ASSIGNMENT LIST</h3><p>

<p><b>1-SEMESTER UNDERGRADUATE ANALYSIS COURSE</b><p>
The proposal below is problematic in several ways: the list assumes
standard categorization of historical styles and periods, without
reexamining them.  Many of the women composers whose works are listed
have composed in a number of styles and may not be well served by my
categorization. My reasons for utilizing current twentieth-century
categories are that both texts and course structures often use such an
approach.  Thus, instructors can &ldquo;plug in&rdquo; a segment of the list with
minimal restructuring of their current syllabi.  I hope that this
article engenders significant discussion and revision proposals, both
of my approach and of those approaches I have implied as &ldquo;standards.&rdquo;
Resources on women&rsquo;s compositions and on the composers themselves are
being developed so quickly that even an electronic journal listing of
this sort is incomplete.  I recommend that those who want additional
information start with the electronic data bases maintained by the
International Alliance of Women Musicians, the American Musicology
Society, and the Society for Music Theory Committee on the Status of
Women.<p><p><p>
