<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Something funny happened to contemporary American music theory on its way to the new millenium. That something was a
collision with history, in the form of the so-called New Musicology, cultural theory, or what Lawrence Kramer has called
postmodern hermeneutics. The collision was unexpected, and was neither universally welcomed nor universally considered funny.
For what has always distinguished us as theorists, what has enabled us to separate
ourselves from musicology and to institute music theory as a discipline in its own right in conservatories,
colleges, and universities, was precisely our ability to do without history: to deal with music synchronically rather than
diachronically, to deal with it as structure rather than style, to approach it more as an object of
an analysis than one of criticism. The music-theoretical enterprise has been driven by
analysis based on theory: Schenkerian theory, pitch-class set theory, twelve-tone theory, and later contour theory,
transformational theory, network theory, neo-Riemannian theory, even theories of music cognition. The payoffs
have been impressive indeed: the theoretical models adopted, invented, and developed in American theory have provided an extraordinary array
of tools, unavailable and unimaginable just thirty years ago, for gaining a musical understanding of a broad range of repertoires,
across all historical periods and across the Western/non-Western and art-music/popular-music divides. Many would argue as well
that American theory has made possible an intelligent and musical pedagogy of both tonal and post-tonal music that was lacking in
previous generations. Yet there have been drawbacks to the new theoretical regime. It
is easy to get into the habit of hearing&mdash;and <i>seeing</i>, for many of our analytical methodologies,
however much they preach about hearing, rely heavily on seeing&mdash;music only as system and structure. To thus limit our
discourse about music leaves us, as theorists, open to the charge, as recent historians have been all
too happy to point out, of ignoring the historical, social, and cultural contexts of
music, of being oblivious to all musical meaning but structural meaning, or in the
memorable words of Leo Treitler, of <nobr>&ldquo;. . . </nobr>drawing the blinds before music&rsquo;s expressive force.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2] Now it may seem, speaking of collisions, that I am on a collision course with an all too obvious moral trope, one that
you already see coming: that theorists should get their heads out of their structures and systems and consider works in their
historical and cultural contexts, as a number of our theorists have done&mdash;and here I might mention, out of many admirable
examples, the work of Kofi Agawu, Robert Hatten, and Gregory Karl.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>If you expect to hear that tired trope from me, you are right; I really do think that theorists should be attentive to musical
meaning, and also that they should be historically aware and should keep abreast of how the best historians, musical or
otherwise, are doing history. So far, so good. But surely this moral injunction is not all I have to say;
if it is, my paper is over now. No, what I propose to do here is not to preach, but to
take a step back and look at the disciplines of music theory and musicology, and to show that, despite their divergence
twenty-five years ago or so in the American academy, they have recently become more closely linked
together, even though they remain, and will surely continue to remain, separate disciplines.</p>
<p>[3] What originally separated music theory and music history is both a matter of repertoire and a matter of approach. With
respect to the former, in the early days of American music theory, theorists competed with musicologists primarily for the
music of the twelve Schenker-approved tonal composers, plus the twentieth-century music of the Second Viennese School, Stravinsky
and Bart&oacute;k, and perhaps a few others. Theorists were generally happy to cede to the
historians the music before that of Bach and Handel, that of innumerable Kleinmeister that the musicologists
had unearthed, the music of Liszt and Wagner (which even the musicologists were not all that interested in), all French music
before and after Debussy and all music in the twentieth century that Benjamin Boretz, in his &ldquo;Metavariations,&rdquo; widely read by
theorists at the time, didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;care about.&rdquo; But until the 1980s radical differences in approach between the two
disciplines regulated competition for repertoire and militated against turf wars. Theorists mined the great tonal and post-tonal works as
fodder for their favored theories, and musicologists mined the same works for style history, composer biography, work reception,
and manuscript study. To be sure, there were crossovers: some theorists maintained an interest in style, work reception, and
manuscript study, and some musicologists appropriated the methods of theory and analysis. But for the most part, it was the case
that theorists and historical musicologists shared only a relatively small repertoire, and within that shared
repertoire, differences in approach kept the disciplines separate.</p>
<p>[4] This disciplinary stability, however, was short-lived. Like an isotope that can maintain its existence only when a number of
independent conditions are exactly right, the disciplinary configuration of the late
1970s and the early 1980s remained in
a steady state only so long as theorists were content to do theory, and historians to do history, and for neither to bother
the other. Yet in the mid- to late 1980s, on both sides of the theory/musicology divide, scholars began to
grow restless with the intellectual limitations that were imposed, or that seemed to be
imposed, upon them by their respective disciplines: positivistic history on the musicology side, Schenkerian and post-tonal
theories on the theory side. Thus was born the so-called New Musicology, which, driven by a
post-structuralist, postmodern critical spirit, soon launched an attack on American music
theory. But at the same time, some theorists were already expanding their own discipline&rsquo;s horizons and were trying to
come to grips with critical theory and to develop a sense of interpretive and historical perspective in their work. The
ensuing disciplinary shakedown has seen an extraordinary expansion of the repertories in which both disciplines have an interest: virtually
all polyphonic Western art music, and much popular and vernacular music as well, are now fair game for both theorists and
musicologists. The past decade and a half or so has also witnessed an explosion of methodologies, to the point that there
is now considerable overlap; both those who call themselves theorists and those who
call themselves musicologists have appropriated semiotics, rhetoric, narrative theory,
deconstruction, feminist theory, postcolonial theory and a variety of other critical approaches to music. Accordingly,
although the old disciplinary lines are still strong, there is more and more work being produced that cuts across these
lines and is more difficult to classify as either music theory or musicology.</p>
<p>[<a name="5">5</a>] Now where is it that the two disciplines most clearly merge? Surely there are firm disciplinary boundaries still in place. No
one is going to mistake a study of repertory in a sixteenth-century chapel as music theory, nor will anyone be
tempted to classify an essay on neo-Riemannian theory or diatonic scale theory as
musicology. But the disciplines do often meet, and where they meet is in repertories of interest to both, at the
joint where analysis shades into interpretation, where structure shades into hermeneutics. This is where the disciplines cross,
simply because, at the site that is the musical work, a plurality of methodologies
naturally leads to a merging of analytical, critical, and historical thinking. It is in fact at this juncture
of analysis and interpretation that historical awareness can best deepen and enrich the analyses that we do as theorists, and that
analysis can best deepen and enrich the critical interpretations that we do as historians.</p>

<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Shostakovich, String Quartet No. 1 in C Major, Op. 49, mm.1-36</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="mccreless_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="mccreless_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>


<p>[6] I shall offer one example of how the two can interact: the opening theme and transitional area of the first movement of
Shostakovich&rsquo;s First String Quartet (see <b> Example 1</b>). Of the many relationships that one could point out, what
interests me most are the interrelations among the melodic phrase-initiating figure of the repeated C&rsquo;s in the first violin,
the ascending scale figure starting on C in the cello, and the phrase rhythm of the entire excerpt. The repeated-C melodic
figure occurs three times: once at the beginning of the antecedent phrase, once at the
beginning of the consequent phrase (2 measures before R. 1), and once at R. 1/5&ndash;6, a pair of measures
that articulates an elision which functions both as the cadence of the opening period and the beginning of the transition. The
ascending scale in the cello occurs four times: once at the beginning, in conjunction with
the melodic repeated figure; once at R. 1/2, where the cello&rsquo;s scale is not coordinated with the
melodic C&rsquo;s; once at R. 1/5, where the two are again coordinated as the transition begins; and once at R. 3, at a slower and more
measured pace, at the final approach to the dominant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[7] What is most striking about the violin figure and cello figure involves less the figures themselves than the ways in
which they are or are not coordinated rhythmically. At the beginning we associate both the repeated-note melodic figure and
the ascending scale with the initiation of a hypermeasure. In the consequent phrase,
however, the repeated-note figure
begins the hypermeasure (at 2 measures before R. 1), but the cello goes its own way, now generating a sharp
dissonance underneath the repeated C&rsquo;s, and delaying its ascending scale a few measures. Now the ascending scale occurs later
in the hypermeasure,
in straight quarter notes, which give the effect of its trying to catch up with the melody. At R. 1/4 the end of the cello&rsquo;s scale
is swept together with ascending motion in the other instruments to bring blatant parallel motion into R. 1/5&ndash;6&mdash;the measures that
constitute the elision, noted above, in which the last two measures of the consequent phrase of the opening period are
simultaneously the opening measures of the transition. The strength of the new beginning is articulated by the
coordination once more of the first violin&rsquo;s repeated-note figure and the cello&rsquo;s ascending scale; but almost humorously, the cello, having
just finished the scale, has to do a double-take and begin it again at the onset of the new hypermeasure. The energy of the
beginning of the transition now generates an almost two-octave ascending scale in the cello, as well as two irregular
hypermeasures, of nine and five measures, respectively. Only at R. 3, where the cello for the
first time asserts its lowest register and begins its slow scalar ascent from C and G in
parallel fifths, does hypermetric regularity return, as the music leads to a half cadence in preparation for the second theme. As
at the beginning, the cello&rsquo;s ascending scale and the repeated-note figure begin a hypermeasure, but this
time the repeated-note figure is not on C, but on A, as the first violin descends from its high point at two measures before R. 3, thus
lending a tonal instability to the hypermetric downbeat that contrasts it with the opening downbeats of the opening theme and of
the transition.</p>
<p>[8] Now all the above is for the most part straightforward analysis, although I resorted briefly to personification and the
attribution of agency to the music toward the end. But suppose we move beyond analysis and see if our historical
sense&mdash;or at least,
my historical sense&mdash;can elucidate the passage even further. I believe that it can, although my historical interpretation can
never assume the level of intersubjectivity that my analysis has. The relevant historical context of the
passage is that the First Quartet, composed in 1938, was the first instrumental work that
Shostakovich wrote after the devastating experience of the condemnation of his opera
<i>Lady Macbeth</i> in early 1936 and his subsequent return to favor with the Fifth Symphony of 1937. I
have always heard the opening measures of the quartet as both placid and yet, in a word, blanched&mdash;outwardly optimistic,
perhaps, but pale and a bit tentative. Shostakovich himself wrote of the quartet, before its premiere, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect to find any
special depth in this, my first quartet opus. In mood it is joyful, merry, lyrical. I would call it
&lsquo;spring-like.&rsquo;&rdquo; And years later he wrote, &ldquo;I tried to convey in it images of childhood,
somewhat na&iuml;ve, springlike moods.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>[9] Yet it seems to me that the grim context of the composition of the First Quartet is at least hinted at obliquely in its
opening measures, peaceful though they be. The nature of the musical materials, I think, supports my hearing: the choice of C
major, as pale a key as one can get; the choice of only repeated notes and scale figures for melodic content&mdash;nothing with any
sharply etched character at all; and the fact that the inner voices have no courage to do anything but to move
together almost exclusively in parallel thirds throughout the whole passage, 36 measures in all. Hearing thus with historical ears, I hear
Shostakovich beginning his cycle of quartets&mdash;works that involve no text, and that avoid the public rhetoric of the
symphony&mdash;pleasantly enough, to be sure, but also in as cautious a fashion as possible: in C, with nothing to rock the boat. The
only assertiveness is in the cleverness of the rhythmic structure, which might be heard as a claim of
strength that hardly anyone, perhaps only the composer himself, would understand.</p>
<p>[10] You may or may not agree with my hearing of the passage: your historical ears may not be the same as mine, you may
consider my historical ears irrelevant, or you may fault my hearing for not being intersubjective. You might also suggest
that such an exercise is more viable&mdash;perhaps all too tempting, you might claim&mdash;with the music of Shostakovich than, say, with
that of Bach or Brahms. Such reservations are well taken, and the analysis does indeed stand on its
own, without any further interpretation. But it is precisely this kind of hearing, this
kind of willingness to step beyond structure, beyond what is rigorously demonstrable, that characterizes the space in which
theorists and historians are meeting these days. It is my contention that, whatever one&rsquo;s disciplinary
allegiances, we should both encourage this sort of historical hearing, since it ties our listening more closely, and more imaginatively, to human
experience, and that we should at the same time insist even more vigorously on the highest standards of structural hearing and
close analysis, since such hearing and such analysis ground us in the music, and curb the willfulness of our historical
speculations. In this way we as theorists can take advantage of our analytical skills and
yet show that we can be historically insightful and sensitive; and we as historians can show that we
understand the cultural context of music while simultaneously demonstrating that we understand in rich detail, and with the
backing of theory, how the music goes, as music.</p>

<h3>SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In the selective bibliography given below, I have endeavored to include some important recent writings about historiography, as
well as essays and books in music theory and musicology, both recent and not-so-recent, that deal significantly with historical
and interpretive issues, both philosophically and analytically. My thanks to my colleague James Hepokoski for some of the
historiographical references.</p>
