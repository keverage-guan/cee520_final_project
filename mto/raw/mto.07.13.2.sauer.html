<p style="text-align: center"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p> 

[1] At SMT&#8217;s November, 2005 meeting in Cambridge, one of the Friday evening 
sessions was titled &#8220;Interacting Interpretive Roles&#8212;Performer and Theorist.&#8221; In 
the third and final presentation of the night, Robert Hatten worked with a 
bright, young string quartet of graduate students from New England Conservatory 
on the third movement (&#8220;Cavatina&#8221;) of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 130 quartet.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>At the start of the session, Hatten told the audience that in fact we would not 
witness a formal presentation in the traditional sense, but would rather act as 
spectators for a coaching session. Hatten mentioned that he had practiced this 
same sort of coaching at his home institution of Indiana University as a guest 
in the chamber music class of violist Atar Arad. It was unclear from his opening 
remarks to what degree he believes his coachings differ from those of applied 
performance faculty. </p>

<p> 

[2] For the session, Hatten and the quartet worked on the first 27 measures of 
the movement, putting theory into practice by focusing on the &#8220;concept of 
plentitude&#8221; and other semiotic insights laid out in the in the eighth chapter of 
his book <i>Musical Meaning in Beethoven</i>.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>His wish was a) to guide the quartet to play the passage in a way which 
reflected what was happening theoretically and rhetorically in the music, i.e. 
to demonstrate an early (measure 8) sense of fulfillment which, after this point, is 
not immediately achieved again, though the music actively searches for it, and 
b) to accomplish this by speaking to the performers in &#8220;plain language.&#8221; Hatten 
made it clear not only that had he never worked with the quartet of players, but 
that the players themselves, while seasoned as an ensemble, had only begun 
working on the piece ten days earlier. In the context of a &#8220;before and after&#8221; 
format (the quartet was asked to play the 27-measure passage at the outset, and 
then at the conclusion of the session), Hatten asked leading questions of the 
players. The quartet&#8217;s answers to these questions ultimately generated a 
considerable amount of interpretive growth, reflected in the more logical, 
committed, and convincing &#8220;after&#8221; performance which ended the session. </p>
<p> 

[3] The first question asked after Hatten&#8217;s coaching was directed towards the 
performers: &#8220;What was it like to have<i> this kind</i> of coaching?&#8221; The question could 
have implied that &#8220;this kind&#8221; of coaching was worlds apart from what actually 
happens when professional performers (as opposed to theorists) lead this sort of 
educational experience, and though it might be argued that Hatten&#8217;s 
presentation, in fact, was <i>very much</i> like what happens when practicing musicians 
engage in ensemble coaching,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
a more provocative question might have been, &#8220;What was it like to interpret 
<i>those kinds of musical gestures</i>?&#8221; A movement full of finicky articulative, 
gestural, and expressive markings cannot be interpretively easy to understand or 
physically easy to execute. Indeed, much of Beethoven&#8217;s music&#8212;especially that of 
the late period&#8212;demands a certain amount of &#8220;reprogramming&#8221; for the performer. 
This reprogramming is necessary because of the seemingly counterintuitive 
interpretive demands it makes upon the performer. In music of the 
common-practice era, the thwarting of expectation (and the concomitant 
building-up of tension) is a fundamental rhetorical and dramatic procedure, but 
rarely does it create a psychological conflict <i>in the performer</i> to the extent 
that it does in the late music of Beethoven. The competing desires to follow 
one&#8217;s own musical intuition and to obey Beethoven&#8217;s performance instructions are 
responsible for this psychological conflict. </p>
<p> 

[4] Most performers would agree that the psychological dissonance created 
by these conflicting desires is ultimately transferred to the body; like any 
stress, it is felt physically. Indeed, the idea that mental stress and other 
cognitive processes manifest themselves in the physical has been explored by 
medical researchers, social scientists, and musicians alike.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></span> 
Because of this phenomenon, there is much more to the art of interpretation than 
some theorists recognize or are willing to address. While the reading of Op. 130 
Hatten shared in his SMT presentation and the research of <i>Musical Meaning in 
Beethoven</i> are undoubtedly some of the most insightful to date, they do not take 
into account the performer&#8217;s mental and physical experience of &#8220;naturalizing&#8221; 
the music<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
(and how this experience affects the interpretation that is then relayed to the 
listener). But doing so might influence, if not change, the meaning of a piece. </p>
<p> 

[5] With this in mind, the following discussion of the first movement of the Op. 
101 piano sonata will use Hatten&#8217;s work as a means by which to raise the 
question of what Beethoven&#8217;s music achieves, both on the sensual and 
intellectual level, by creating in the performer a sense of unease that 
psychologists call &#8220;cognitive dissonance.&#8221; Before moving into a discussion of 
cognitive dissonance, however, we will recall and reexamine Hatten&#8217;s 
interpretation of the movement, and will propose that current theories of 
embodiment and image schema provide a way of understanding musical 
norms/expectation. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Hatten&#8217;s Reading: Op. 101 as a Pastoral Topic</b></p>

<p> 

[6] In <i>Musical Meaning</i>, Hatten devotes an entire chapter to discussing the 
&#8220;pastoral as fundamental topical premise&#8221; in Op. 101.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  
In the sonata, the first movement acts as a frame, governing the expressive 
genre of the entire sonata.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
Typical pastoral features apparent in the movement are six-eight meter, pedal 
points (heard even in the first gesture), slow harmonic motion, simple melodic 
contour, contrary motion, rocking accompaniment, parallel thirds, consonant 
appoggiatura, elaborated resolution of dissonance, major mode, and quiet 
dynamics.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
More interesting, though, as Hatten points out, is the way Beethoven contrasts 
the pastoral with &#8220;tragic irruptions [that] create dramatic moments of crisis.&#8221; 
The primary tragic climaxes occur in the middle of the development (measures 5&ndash;1) 
and in the transition to the coda (measures 85&#8211;87), and are characterized by great 
dynamic surges that are undercut by <i>subito piano</i> (measure 52) and decaying dynamics 
(measures 8&ndash;8) before attaining their climactic goals.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>

 
<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Beethoven, Op. 101 (i), measures 1&#8211;35</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="sauer_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="sauer_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[7] Examples of these undercuttings can be heard even in the short exposition of the movement (measures 1&#8211;33; 
			see <b>Example 1</b>).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>Indeed, they are one of the most salient features of the piece.</p>

<p>
[8] We should notice first the avoidance of an authentic cadence until measure 25. 
The opening phrase of the movement (measures 1&#8211;4) sits on a dominant harmony that in 
the second, parallel phrase leads to a deceptive cadence (measures 5&#8211;6), and a second 
deceptive cadence is found at measure 16. Also notable are the struggle involved in 
reaching the cadence at measure 25&#8212;three stalled attempts between measures 19 to 
24&#8212;and the way Beethoven never allows his pianist to gain any footing in this 
struggle: with respect to dynamics, each attempt begins where it started, at 
<i>piano</i>. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that once achieved, this 
hard-earned resolution is unconsummated, for the arrival on the dominant harmony 
(measure 25) is marked <i>subito piano</i>. </p>

<p> 
[9] Hatten also identifies what he calls &#8220;yearning&#8221; in the passage, 
conveyed by the stepwise ascent of measures 7&#8211;9 (highlighted by a bass moving in 
contrary motion), which results not in resolution but deception (the weak-beat 
resolution of the leading tone, followed by an immediate leap downwards). Hatten 
claims that yearnings such as these should not climax, for their doing so &#8220;might 
either upset the self-established propriety of the movement or too decisively 
break its continuity.&#8221; Thus, these &#8220;yearnings&#8221; give way to &#8220;resignation,&#8221; and 
ultimately &#8220;the pastoral exerts its control . . . and the movement ends with a 
serenity that, in its registral extremes, invokes transcendence or spiritual grace.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>
<p> 



[10] Much of Hatten&#8217;s analysis of Op. 130 offers a kind of insight into this 
difficult and elusive movement that could inspire marked musical growth among 
pianists, just as his on-site remarks did for the quartet members who 
participated in his SMT presentation.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></span> 
Having said that, I believe that there are problems with Hatten&#8217;s analysis that 
stem from his failure to address the performer&#8217;s physical and mental experience 
with the music. Indeed, were he to acknowledge this important perspective in his 
analysis, he would find that the cognitive complexities of the sonata&#8217;s first 
movement suggest a different outcome than &#8220;resignation&#8221; or &#8220;spiritual grace,&#8221; 
for they create a psychological dissonance in the performer that is both 
disconcerting <i>and</i> meaningful. Specifically&#8212;and most importantly&#8212;the undercuttings that manifest themselves in 
<i>subito piano </i>markings at important 
cadential arrival points (the dominant harmonies at measure 24 and measure 76) are, in 
effect, instructions to the performer to fight musical convention or to do that 
which is seemingly counterintuitive. Ultimately, the interpretive difficulties 
of this movement, the struggle it wages against the performer&#8217;s expectation and 
instinct, generates for the pianist not a feeling of resignation, but rather one 
of dissatisfaction and even frustration. In other words, the struggles involved 
in interpreting the movement create physical as well as cognitive discomfort in 
the performer. These are not elements of &#8220;spiritual grace.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>The Roles of Convention and Metaphor in Creating Musical Expectation </b></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><i>Musical Convention: Expectation and Norms</i></p>

<p> 

[11] Before moving into a discussion of dissonance theory as it applies to the 
first movement of Op. 101, one must ask the rather difficult question &#8220;What, for 
the performer, constitutes &#8216;counterintuitive&#8217; in musical gesture and 
expression?&#8221; The issue raised by this question is separate from other problems 
the performer faces: virtuosic technical demands and/or the &#8220;unplayable&#8221; 
sometimes found in music. Technical passages, while presenting both physical 
and, on some level, cognitive problems, do not necessarily require the performer 
to grapple with issues of interpretation; a so-called &#8220;unplayable passage&#8221; on 
the other hand, presents <i>only</i> a problem of interpretation, as when composers 
deliberately write contradictory performance instructions. (An example is the 
third movement of Shostakovich&#8217;s eighth string quartet, where the violist is 
asked to play <i>con sordino</i> at a <i>ff</i> dynamic). 
<p> 

[12] Certainly the logical and aurally satisfying (i.e. expected) musical 
gesture is bound to the norms of any given style period, which are, in turn, 
defined in part by what happened in the preceding style period(s). Beethoven&#8217;s 
sonatas are no exception. Mozart&#8217;s and Haydn&#8217;s pieces of the same genre defined 
the expected modes of musical expression for these works (as has been catalogued 
masterfully by Ratner, Rosen, Rosenblum, and others).<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></span> 
That Haydn and Mozart, compared to Beethoven, wrote a fractional number of 
instructions for the performer does not negate the fact that a pianist in 1816 
would have expected certain musical truths to be self-evident. 

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[13] The pastoral topic as variously 
			embodied by Beethoven&#8217;s precursors helps to define what would have 
			constituted &#8220;musical truth&#8221; for a pianist of his time. For example, 
			the theme (and all but one of the subsequent variations) of the 
			first movement of Mozart&#8217;s well-known piano sonata in A, K. 331 
			(see <b>Example 2</b>), 
			instructs the keyboardist to play the final cadence (which ends the 
			codetta) at a <i>forte</i> dynamic, strengthening the sense of closure.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></span> 
			There is also a stepwise ascent in the soprano in the penultimate

			<nobr>101.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></nobr> 
			Unlike Beethoven, Mozart allows this yearning to be satisfied. It 
			should be noted that here, though the perfect authentic cadence in 
			measure 8 is marked <i>piano</i> and directly follows a chord marked <i>sf</i>, it 
			differs from Beethoven&#8217;s instructions in Op. 101 (i) in that it does 
			not require the performer to suddenly back off of the final dominant 
			harmony of the cadential figure.</p><p> 

[14] It is also instructive to consider, again, the exposition of Beethoven&#8217;s 
Op. 101 (i), and compare it to the previous example of Mozart. As many pianists 
have noted, none of the older composer&#8217;s piano sonatas demand that Vienna&#8217;s 
amateurs execute something as outrageously complicated as this passage of 
Beethoven&#8217;s. In addition to the &#8220;undercuttings,&#8221; an overwhelming number of 
musical instructions are indicated (see Example 1): six <i>p</i> markings, seven indications 
to either <i>crescendo</i> or <i>diminuendo</i>, a <i>sforzando</i> in measure 24, complicated 
articulations in abundance, and Beethoven&#8217;s dual indications &#8216;<i>Etwas lebhaft und 
mit der innigsten Empfindung</i>&#8217; and &#8216;<i>espressivo e semplice</i>.&#8217;</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[15] By contrast, in his own, 
			earlier exploration of the pastoral topic at the keyboard, Beethoven 
			complies with the musical expectations passed down to him. Though 
			the texture of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 28 (i) is richer than the texture of 
			the theme of Mozart&#8217;s K. 331 (i), leading to a less modest treatment 
			of accent (<i>sforzando</i>) and syncopation, like Mozart he treats the 
			important sectional cadences as goals, firmly marking them as 
			arrival points 
			(see <b>Example 3</b>). </p>
<p> 

[16] The three attempts to reach the section&#8217;s goal&#8212;measures 21&#8211;27, measures 29&#8211;35, and 
measures 35&#8211;39&#8212;foreshadow the parallel structure of measures 18&#8211;25 in the exposition of 
Op. 101 (i), though here these attempts are &#8220;rewarded&#8221; with a <i>crescendo</i> 
beginning in measure 36 that, rather than suddenly (and surprisingly) backing off of 
the harmonic aim (the final V7 chord on beat 3 of measure 38) and creating a sense of 
frustrated expectation (as in Op. 101 (i)), sails through to a satisfactory 
conclusion.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup><p>[17] <i>The major disparity between Beethoven&#8217;s late sonata movement and the 
earlier ones lies not so much in their relative degrees of technical difficulty 
as in their respective degrees of cognitive complexity</i>. This complexity, 
moreover, created in large part by the composer&#8217;s extensive overlay of 
performance instructions, presented the musicians of Beethoven&#8217;s day with 
something new to their experience. What must it have taken for pianists of the 
time to internalize these performance instructions? And, once cognitive control 
was attained, how was their musical intuition challenged?</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[18] Ultimately the significance of 
			the multitudinous interpretive instructions Beethoven assigns in Op. 
			101 (i) lies not in their number, but in the fact that they ask 
			performers of the movement to eschew musical convention. Time and 
			time again, the feeling of forward motion and the progress toward 
			harmonic goals are thwarted in the passage, and thus an &#8220;easy&#8221; sense 
			of fulfillment is never granted the performer. The &#8220;undercuttings&#8221; 
			and &#8220;yearnings&#8221; so perceptively identified by Hatten must be taken 
			to heart by the pianist, and their execution requires a disciplined 
			approach to this delicate and intricate music. The instinct of most 
			pianists would be to mark the goal of closure in measures 24&#8211;25 with a 
			strong, <i>forte</i> dynamic, with special emphasis on the dissonant V<sup>7</sup> 
			triad of measure 24 (see <b>Example 4</b>), and I challenge Hatten&#8217;s assessment that &#8220;with the 
			third arpeggiation [measures 23&#8211;24], the gesture of yearning is permitted 
			to climax and achieve completion, as confirmed by the first perfect 
			authentic cadence of the movement.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></span> 
			On the contrary, from the performer&#8217;s perspective the cadence of measures 
			24&#8211;25 does not &#8220;confirm&#8221; a sense of climax and completion but rather 
			<i>undermines</i> it. Hatten downplays the dynamic undercutting of the 
			passage on grounds that it is &#8220;consistent with the thematic strategy 
			of undercutting,&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></span> 
			a strategy he has previously called appropriate because it works to 
			preserve &#8220;the self-established propriety&#8221; and &#8220;continuity&#8221; of the 
			movement. What propriety would be upset with the following 
			interpretation of the movement?</p>

<p>[19] One might even argue that 
			this alternate interpretation <i>maintains</i> continuity rather than 
			<i>breaks</i> it, and indeed, it is certainly easier for the pianist to 
			execute, interpretively speaking, than what Beethoven wrote. 
			Similarly, Beethoven demands complete physical control in the 
			&#8220;yearning&#8221; stepwise ascent in measures 7&#8211;9, allowing the <i>crescendo</i> to 
			reach only <i>mezzo f.</i><span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></span> 
			On top of these denials, Beethoven adds all of the interpretive 
			details mentioned earlier, a bombardment of information which 
			produces anything but pastoral peace.</p>

[20] Interestingly, in 1816, the same year Op. 101 was composed, Hummel wrote 
about the need for performers to experience their music deeply:<blockquote>
	<p>Expression relates immediately to the feelings and denotes in the player 
	a capacity and facility of displaying by his performance, and urging to the 
	heart of his audience, whatever the composer had addressed to the feelings 
	in his production, and which the performer must feel after him. . . 
	Expression may be awakened indeed but. . . it can neither be taught nor 
	acquired; it dwells within the soul itself and must be transfused directly 
	from it into the performance.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></span>
</blockquote>
<p> 

<p>To honor 
			this dictum must have engendered some level of cognitive dissonance 
			for 19th century interpreters of Beethoven. They are asked to feel 
			&#8220;whatever the composer had addressed to the feelings&#8221; and thus fully 
			engage the senses, though to do so in Op. 101 (i) would be to engage 
			in conflict because the music requires, on some levels, a revamping 
			of what it means to play instinctively. This need to revamp, in 
			turn, creates a conceptual and physical challenge for the performer, 
			raising questions about Beethoven&#8217;s formal and psychological intent. 
			<p>[21] Thus one wonders whether Beethoven meant for his pianists to 
			feel this sense of incompleteness, longing, and frustrated desire. 
			Could he have predicted that the challenge of understanding and 
			internalizing his seemingly counterintuitive gestures would create 
			cognitive discomfort in future students of Op. 101 (i)?</p>

<p>[22] 
			Turning to pastoral-style piano writing by later 19th century 
			composers, we see some of the varied ways that expectation can be 
			fulfilled by dynamic climax. While these examples possess the richly 
			detailed expressive markings typical of the period, they still 
			usually allow thematic material to consummate in climaxes. Chopin&#8217;s 
			treatment of cadence in the first eighteen bars of his <i>Barcarolle</i>, 
			Op. 60, is an example (see <b>Example 5</b>).<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>


<p>[23] The <i>crescendo</i> to the dominant harmony in measure 14 is a climactic moment, 
and waves of dissipation over eight long beats slowly release the tension 
generated by it. The next four bars (measures 17&#8211;20) constitute a sequential, 
transitional passage that tonicizes first B Major (measures 17&#8211;18) and then D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> Minor 
(measures 19&#8211;20). In both of these 2-bar units, the dominant-to-tonic harmonic motion 
is intensified by <i>crescendo</i> markings. While these cadential arrivals are treated 
differently&#8212;in the cadence of measures 14&#8211;15 the tonic resolution is part of a 
decaying dynamic, and in the cadences of measures 17&#8211;18 and measures 19&#8211;20 the tonic 
resolution is part of an increasing one&#8212;both differ from Beethoven&#8217;s cadential 
arrivals in Op. 101 (i). It is Beethoven&#8217;s marking of <i>subito piano</i> on the 
			<u>arrival</u> at the dominant (measure 24, measure 26) that the pianist finds particularly 
difficult to implement. Generally speaking, the pianist&#8217;s instinct is to &#8220;lean&#8221; 
on the dissonant dominant chord of a perfect authentic cadence; when this is 
disallowed, musical instinct is frustrated.</p>


<p> 
[24] Schubert chooses the key of B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"> Major for his pastoral topic, and though he 
doesn&#8217;t specifically target cadence as a vehicle of psychological manipulation, 
he does create, for the pianist/listener, a desire for dynamic climax that 
parallels the one Beethoven creates in Op. 101 (i). The primary theme of the 
first movement of Schubert&#8217;s sonata, D. 960, is conspicuously marked <i>pp</i> at its 
first three appearances (measures 1&#8211;9, measures 10&#8211;18, and measures 20&#8211;27 [in the key of
<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop">VI]), 
and these delicate, hushed (even suppressed) statements demand a physical and 
mental control that is similar to that demanded of the pianist in playing 
Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 101 (i). Unlike Beethoven, however, Schubert provides a release 
for this dynamic control at the fourth appearance of the primary theme (measures 
36&#8211;48), where the pianist is allowed to play the passage full-throttle. The 
<i>crescendo</i> leading to the cadence is marked <i>ff</i> as the music modulates to <nobr>F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"></nobr> Minor 
(measures 46&#8211;48) (see <b>Example 6</b>). 
			<p> 

[25] These passages help explain why, even post-1816, the pianist interpreting 
Op. 101 (i) might experience a struggle in reconciling musical intuition with 
Beethoven&#8217;s demands. The common treatment of cadence (and, in the case of 
Schubert, the music enveloping the cadence) establishes&#8212;whether consciously or 
not&#8212;the expectation that in pastoral-genre keyboard music structurally important 
authentic cadences will be treated as arrivals. Moreover, in an otherwise 
tonally elusive work, the cadences of Op. 101 (i) play a crucial role in 
establishing tonic,<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></span> 
so when they are undercut the effect is emotionally intensified. When 
performers&#8217; musical expectations are challenged in this way, the physical (i.e. 
technical) and conceptual become conflated&#8212;interpretation becomes an issue of 
both body and mind. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"> <b>Schema Theory </b>
<p> 

[26] An explanation for why these musical expectations exist in the first place 
and how these expectations are connected to the body may be found in theories of 
embodiment and image schema. First presented by linguist George Lakoff and 
philosopher Mark Johnson in <i>Metaphors We Live By</i>, schema theory posits that 
cognition itself (our ordinary conceptual system) is fundamentally metaphorical 
and that metaphor is a &#8220;fundamental mode of understanding and meaning by which 
we project patterns from one domain of experience in order to structure a domain 
of a different kind.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup></span> 
More specifically, through metaphor we conceptualize a typically unfamiliar or 
abstract domain&#8212;called a &#8220;target&#8221; domain&#8212;in terms of another, more familiar, 
concrete domain&#8212;a &#8220;source&#8221; domain.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></span> 
<p> 

[27] After <i>Metaphors</i>, Johnson expanded the theory of embodiment in 
<i>The Body in 
the Mind</i> to account for how humans conceive of source domains. He explained that 
this is possible because source domains spring from repeated patterns of bodily 
experience called <i>image schemata</i>. To clarify, Johnson&#8217;s <i>kinesthetic image 
schemata</i>, those &#8220;recurring dynamic patterns of our perceptual interactions and 
motor programs that give coherence and structure to our experience,&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></span> 
are <i>preconceptual</i> structures which function beneath the conceptual level and 
originate in the body. 
<p> 

[28] One can get a good sense of Johnson&#8217;s argument by reading the Preface to 
<i>The Body in the Mind</i>, where he directly challenges what he calls traditional 
&#8220;Objectivist&#8221; accounts of meaning and rationality&#8212;those which disregard the 
&#8220;<i>humanness</i> (the human embodiment) of understanding&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></span>&#8212;and instead champions an account that focuses on the 
<i>human body</i>, and especially those structures of imagination and understanding that emerge from our embodied experience.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></span>
He writes: 
<blockquote>
	<p>The body has been ignored by Objectivism because it has been thought to 
	introduce subjective elements alleged to be irrelevant to the objective 
	nature of meaning. The body has been ignored because reason has been thought 
	to be abstract and transcendent, that is, not tied to any bodily aspects of 
	human understanding. The body has been ignored because it seems to have no 
	role in our reasoning about abstract subject matters. 
	<p>Yet . . . the embodiment of human meaning and understanding manifests 
	itself over and over, in ways intimately connected to forms of imaginative 
	structuring and experience. The kind of imaginative structuring uncovered in 
	[empirical studies that focus on phenomena where human understanding is 
	required for an account of meaning and reason] does not involve romantic 
	flights of fancy unfettered by, and transcending, our bodies; rather, they 
	are forms of imagination that grow out of bodily experience, as it 
	contributes to our understanding and guides our <nobr>reasoning.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup></span></nobr>
</blockquote>
<p> 

He continues:

<blockquote>
	<p>The centrality of human embodiment directly influences what and how 
	things can be meaningful to us, the ways in which these meanings can be 
	developed and articulated, the ways we are able to comprehend and reason 
	about our experience, and the actions we take. Our reality is shaped by the 
	patterns of our bodily movement, the contours of our spatial and temporal 
	orientation, and the forms of our interaction with objects. It is never 
	merely a matter of abstract conceptualizations and propositional judgments.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup></span>
</blockquote>
<p> 

[29] Music theorists have become particularly interested in how kinesthetic 
image schemata make it metaphorically possible to project a target domain onto a 
source domain, a cognitive pursuit called <i>cross-domain mapping</i>. Cross-domain 
mapping allows us to conceptualize aspects of musical experience in terms of 
concepts borrowed from other domains and, as Lawrence Zbikowski explains, allows 
us to &#8220;ground our descriptions of elusive musical phenonmena in concepts derived 
from everyday experience&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup></span> 
(image schemata). Indeed, much of the application of schema theory to music 
explores how metaphorical conceptualization illuminates theories of music and 
helps &#8220;interpret recurrent tropes of musical understanding.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup></span> 
<p> 

[30]
To understand our attitudes and cognitions about the role of cadence in 
Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 101, therefore, we might first consider the metaphor PURPOSES 
ARE PHYSICAL GOALS, a source domain as identified by Johnson.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></span> 
The metaphor derives from the PATH image schema. Johnson explains that &#8220;our 
lives are filled with paths that connect up our spatial world,&#8221; whether they be 
physical or imagined, and that every path has a source (or starting point), a 
goal (or ending point), and a sequence of contiguous locations connecting the 
source with the goal.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup></span> 
Because human beings have purposes in traversing paths, they tend to experience 
them as directional; therefore, the PATH schema grounds the metaphor PURPOSES 
ARE PHYSICAL GOALS. 
<p> 

[31] Diane Urista has shown how the PATH schema gives rise to a related 
conceptual metaphor in music: TONAL MUSIC IS GOAL-DIRECTED MOTION.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup></span>
Indeed, it takes little effort to think of the many ways music theorists have 
mapped the musical concepts of &#8220;phrase&#8221; and &#8220;cadence&#8221; (not to mention larger 
tonal structures) onto the PATH schema. In discussing music of the 
common-practice era, we often speak of cadences in terms of &#8220;goals,&#8221; &#8220;arrivals,&#8221; 
&#8220;resting points,&#8221; and so on. Cadences occur at <i>completion</i> of the phrase and are 
the harmonic <i>goals</i> of phrases.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup></span> 
Furthermore, Urista explains, &#8220;one of the most pervasive entailments associated 
with the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL [PATH] schema is tension and release.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup></span> 
Lerdahl and Jackendoff have shown that musical phrase is a goal-directed motion 
in which tension is increased as the event progresses towards its goal and that 
there is a sense of relaxation when the goal is attained,<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup></span> 
and Urista posits that &#8220;when involved in attaining a purpose of some sort, we 
experience a wide range of psychological and emotional patterns of tension and 
release, such as a sense of unfulfillment-fulfillment, 
expectation-accomplishment, [and] desire-gratification. Psychological patterns 
of tension and release are embedded in numerous musical structures.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup></span> 
<p> 

[32]
These theories help explain why performers of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 101 (i) find 
themselves psychologically conflicted at certain points of the movement, namely 
those points where cadences are undercut (measures 24&#8211;25 and measures 76&#8211;77). Experience 
and image schemata account for what, to musicians, feel like ingrained 
expectations (or musical conventions)&#8212;specifically the sense that cadences, 
especially those that are hard-earned and set up as distinct arrivals, will be 
fulfilled through dynamic climax. When this expectation is frustrated, 
psychological dissonance sets in. 
<p> 

[33] More specifically, in the learning stages of the work&#8212;in grappling with 
interpretive issues&#8212;different desires pull at the pianist: one to satisfy 
expectations so deeply ingrained that the performer experiences them as 
instinctive, the other to honor Beethoven&#8217;s intention. Therefore Op. 101 (i) 
challenges straightforward notions of musical intuition and norms. The process 
of recognizing its interpretive difficulties, understanding their purpose in 
defining the meaning of the work, and naturalizing the language and syntax they 
employ creates a mental and physical challenge which is uncomfortable (and 
difficult) for the performer. 

<p style="text-align: center"><b>The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance and Its Application to Op. 101</b></p>

<p> 

[34] Leon Festinger&#8217;s theory of cognitive dissonance, first published in 1957, 
helped define the human need to achieve consistency among cognitions. A 
dissonance between two cognitions might exist because of what a person has 
learned or come to expect, or because of what is considered appropriate or 
usual, and this dissonance is psychologically unpleasant or aversive.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup></span> 
For instance, if musical intuition&#8212;governed by musical convention&#8212;instructs us 
to <i>crescendo</i> through a structurally important cadence, thus highlighting the 
arrival, and the music prescribes the opposite (as in measures 24&#8211;25 of Op. 101, i), 
we are faced with dissonant cognitions. Festinger describes his theory of 
dissonance in the following way: 
<blockquote>
	<p>The terms &#8220;dissonance&#8221; and &#8220;consonance&#8221; refer to relations that exist 
	between pairs of &#8220;elements.&#8221; These elements refer to what has been called 
	cognition, that is, the things a person knows about himself, about his 
	behavior, and about his surroundings. These elements, then, are &#8220;knowledges,&#8221; 
	if I may coin the plural form of the word. Some of these elements represent 
	knowledges about oneself: what one does, what one feels, what one wants or 
	desires, what one is, and the like. Other elements of knowledge concern the 
	world in which one lives: what is where, what leads to what, what things are 
	satisfying or painful or inconsequential or important, etc.
	     <p>It is clear that the term &#8220;knowledge&#8221; has been used to include 
			things to which the word does not ordinarily refer&#8212;for example, 
			opinions. A person does not hold an opinion unless he thinks it is 
			correct, and so, psychologically, it is not different from 
			&#8220;knowledge.&#8221; The same is true of beliefs, values, or attitudes, 
			which function as &#8220;knowledges.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup></span>
	</blockquote>
	<p> 

He explains cognitive dissonance itself as follows: 
<blockquote>
	<p>For one reason or another, attempts to achieve consistency [among 
	knowledges] may fail. The inconsistency then simply continues to exist. 
	Under such circumstances&#8212;that is, in the presence of an inconsistency&#8212;there 
	is psychological discomfort.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup></span>
</blockquote>
<p> 

[35] In Festinger&#8217;s theory, dissonant cognitions such as those experienced when 
working on Op. 10 (i) would possibly motivate an attitude change.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup></span> 
Attitude changes may involve reducing the importance of the conflicting beliefs, 
acquiring new beliefs that change the formula of dissonance, or removing the 
conflicting attitude or behavior. The &#8220;acquiring [of] new beliefs that change 
the formula of dissonance&#8221; is precisely what happens when performers study, 
analyze and contextualize those gestures of Op. 101 (i) that initially seem 
counterintuitive. Specifically, this process of discovery eventually leads one 
to understand that the dynamic undercutting of cadences ultimately works in 
service to a higher goal of the piece&#8212;namely that of delayed gratification. It 
is my belief that Beethoven purposefully undercuts climaxes in the movement as a 
psychological ploy; he wishes his performers and listeners to sense the 
frustration of unconsummated climax. This phenomenon, therefore, is signposted 
as an issue to be dealt with later in the sonata as a whole.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p> 

[36] It is for this reason, finally, that I disagree with Hatten&#8217;s reading of 
the first movement, which claims that musical yearning ultimately &#8220;gives way to 
resignation.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup></span>
In addition to the marked moments of crisis heard in the development of the 
movement (measures 50&#8211;52) and at the end of the recapitulation (measures 85&#8211;87),<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup></span> 
and the repeated undercuttings and yearnings of the expository material in the 
recapitulation, the last phrase of the movement reinforces the psychological 
frustration that pervades the movement in its entirety 
(see <b>Example 7</b>). 

 
<p>[37] Here Beethoven combines the two elements of yearning and undercutting: a 
stepwise ascent highlighted, as in measures 7&#8211;9, by the bass moving in contrary 
motion arrives at a cadence marked <i>piano</i>. Even in the final moments of the 
movement, pianists must back off of the cadential arrival and are forced to 
refrain from leaning (ever-so-slightly, of course, in deference to the unusually 
high register) on the dissonant dominant harmony. While aurally there may be a 
sense that the &#8220;pastoral exerts its control . . . and the movement ends with [a] 
serenity,&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup></span> 
this psychologically and thus physically frustrating manifestation of the 
pastoral topic leaves the performer not with a sense of serenity, but rather a 
sense of longing. 
</p>

<p> 

[38] A look at the subsequent movements of Op. 101 confirms that Beethoven 
purposely sought to challenge musical expectation and convention in the elusive 
opening one. Though we may never know whether the composer consciously 
recognized the psychological frustration performers would meet in learning the 
piece, one thing seems certain: the issue of dynamically undercut cadences is 
ultimately one of delayed gratification, not of &#8220;resignation&#8221; and &#8220;spiritual 
grace&#8221; as Hatten posits. Both the second movement March and the return of the 
first movement&#8217;s pastoral opening measures before the finale resolve the 
&#8220;problem&#8221; of undercut climaxes presented in the first movement. 

 <div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 8</b>.

<p>[39] For the performer, the formally and musically straightforward second 
movement is more <i>cognitively consonant</i> and more physically satisfying than the 
first. The reason for this is twofold: first, Beethoven casts the movement as a 
march, one of the most overtly physical of all genres. Indeed, as Solomon has 
written, Beethoven &#8220;[captures] the expressiveness of the human body by a 
magnified use of dance and march forms . . . (what Cooper calls a &#8216;transfigured 
play&#8217; element) in [his] late works.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup></span> 
This shift in focus from the pastoral/spiritual to the physical comes as an 
interpretive respite for the performer. Second, this straightforward march ends 
unequivocally on a perfect authentic cadence, written in resounding octaves and 
marked <i>forte</i> (see <b>Example 8</b>). Beethoven allows the performer to unleash all 
inhibition, playing with the freedom and abandon denied in the first movement. 
Because of the second movement&#8217;s interpretive accessibility, the performer 
immediately experiences a degree of comfort&#8212;a sense of <i>satisfaction</i>&#8212;in playing 
the movement that is not allowed in the first.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup></span> 
<p>[40] An even more important resolution comes, however, when the music of the 
work&#8217;s opening pastoral-style theme returns before the finale. Here, the 
psychological frustrations and longing of the first movement&#8212;caused by the 
dynamic undercutting of cadence&#8212;is finally dealt with head-on 
(see <b>Example 9</b>). 
<p>[41] When the pastoral theme returns, &#8220;[restoring] the topical field that 
governs the expressive genre as a whole,&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup></span>
it behaves like a transition by connecting the third, <i>adagio</i> movement to the 
<i>allegro</i> finale. More significantly, though, there is a crucial point of 
resolution as a &#8220;cadential flourish on the dominant&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup></span>
marked with a <i>crescendo</i> moves to the tonic A major chord, heralding the arrival 
of the finale. At this moment, the musical expectations thwarted throughout the 
first movement and suspended in the second are finally met, and we 
retrospectively understand at least one of Beethoven&#8217;s reasons for creating 
psychological frustration through the constant undercutting of climax.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup></span> 
For the performer, the gratification that accompanies this consummation is 
conceptual, psychological, and physical. Recognizing and understanding this 
sense of fulfillment affects greatly one&#8217;s interpretation and reading of the 
first movement.</p>
			<p> 

[42] The central thesis of this article is that the most comprehensive reading 
of a piece takes into account not only the theorist&#8217;s (and listener&#8217;s) 
experience of the music, but also the performer&#8217;s, and this argument finds 
support in Zbikowski&#8217;s claim that &#8220;theories are the cognitive tools that guide 
the way we reason about the things we experience.&#8221;<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup></span> 
Listeners, of course, whether they be academicians versed in theory or audience 
members whose only understanding of music is intuitive, experience music without 
having to consider the physical demands of performance.<span lang="en-us"><sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup></span> 
Performers, however, necessarily cultivate a unique psychological and thus 
physical relationship with each piece of music they learn and play, and this 
relationship ultimately bears upon their understanding and interpretation, even 
after they have internalized every aspect of the music and have become 
co-conspirators with the composer. It is for this reason that I offer a reading 
of the first movement of Op. 101 that goes beyond Hatten&#8217;s exploration of the 
pastoral topic and in doing so underscores the importance of symbiosis between 
theorist and performer.</p>

Therefore, his semiotic approach is enhanced by way of metaphor and word choice, which he uses to convey not only the meaning of but also the 
<i>tone</i> of a work.  I believe that this, in part, accounts for the interpretive growth he is able to inspire in performers.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> See Leonard Ratner, <i>Classic Music: Expression, Form, and Style

<i>subito p</i> markings at cadential arrivals (as he does in Op. 101), while in the highly stylized&#8212;and therefore more objective&#8212;pastoral music of movements i and iv he does not.  Interestingly, the earlier sonata uses undercutting as a specific and even extreme expressive device that stands in contrast to the pastoral topos, while Op. 101 
<i>combines</i> undercutting and the Pastoral to create the interpretive difficulties discussed in this paper.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> Ibid.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> Ibid., 101.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> Another important example of this &#8220;control&#8221; demanded of the pianist can be seen in m. 52 of the development (one of Hatten&#8217;s &#8220;tragic irruptions&#8221;).  Here Beethoven disallows the performer to &#8220;emotionally conclude&#8221; the angry outburst from mm. 50&#8211;52, writing a 
<i>subito piano</i> on the final chord of the gesture.  While this sort of &#8220;suppressed&#8221; gesture is commonplace in Beethoven, it is significant that here it occurs on the

Urista discusses how the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema underlies much of Schenker&#8217;s theory, including the concept of linear progression (<i>Zug</i>) as a path that can be taken (<i>Weg</i>), or a motion along a path (<i>Durchgehen</i>); the 
<i>Ursatz</i> as goal-directed motion and one that should evoke a sense of <i>Spannung</i> and 
<i>Erf&uuml;llung</i> (striving and fulfillment/tension and release); the idea that 
<i>Urlinie-Zug</i> must always descend to tonic and come to a <i>complete rest</i>; and the idea that the
<i>Bassbrechung</i> must rise to the fifth and <i>fall</i> to the root, reinforcing the effects of striving and fulfillment.  Similarly, in the following passage from 
<i>Der freie Satz</i>, we witness the abstract metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY, also derived from the SOURCE-PATH GOAL schema: &#8220;Every linear progression shows the eternal shape of life&#8212;birth to death.

Therefore, his semiotic approach is enhanced by way of metaphor and word choice, which he uses to convey not only the meaning of but also the 
<i>tone</i> of a work.  I believe that this, in part, accounts for the interpretive growth he is able to inspire in performers.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">See Leonard Ratner, <i>Classic Music: Expression, Form, and Style

<i>subito p</i> markings at cadential arrivals (as he does in Op. 101), while in the highly stylized&#8212;and therefore more objective&#8212;pastoral music of movements i and iv he does not.  Interestingly, the earlier sonata uses undercutting as a specific and even extreme expressive device that stands in contrast to the pastoral topos, while Op. 101 
<i>combines</i> undercutting and the Pastoral to create the interpretive difficulties discussed in this paper.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid., 101.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">Another important example of this &#8220;control&#8221; demanded of the pianist can be seen in m. 52 of the development (one of Hatten&#8217;s &#8220;tragic irruptions&#8221;).  Here Beethoven disallows the performer to &#8220;emotionally conclude&#8221; the angry outburst from mm. 50&#8211;52, writing a 
<i>subito piano</i> on the final chord of the gesture.  While this sort of &#8220;suppressed&#8221; gesture is commonplace in Beethoven, it is significant that here it occurs on the

Urista discusses how the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema underlies much of Schenker&#8217;s theory, including the concept of linear progression (<i>Zug</i>) as a path that can be taken (<i>Weg</i>), or a motion along a path (<i>Durchgehen</i>); the 
<i>Ursatz</i> as goal-directed motion and one that should evoke a sense of <i>Spannung</i> and 
<i>Erf&uuml;llung</i> (striving and fulfillment/tension and release); the idea that 
<i>Urlinie-Zug</i> must always descend to tonic and come to a <i>complete rest</i>; and the idea that the
<i>Bassbrechung</i> must rise to the fifth and <i>fall</i> to the root, reinforcing the effects of striving and fulfillment.  Similarly, in the following passage from 
<i>Der freie Satz</i>, we witness the abstract metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY, also derived from the SOURCE-PATH GOAL schema: &#8220;Every linear progression shows the eternal shape of life&#8212;birth to death.  The linear progression begins, lives its own existence in the passing tones, ceases when it has reached its goal&#8212;all as organic life itself.&#8221;  (See Urista, &#8220;Embodying,&#8221; pp. 70&#8211;79.)</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid., 37.</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, <i>A Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i> (Cambridge: MIT Press,
