<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The last time I spoke at a meeting of our Society, there was trouble.
That was in New York in 1995, where several colleagues and I responded to the
challenge of the then so-called New Musicology. A vigorous discussion followed
for a few weeks after the meeting, but as often happens with these things,
interest soon waned and many went back to business as usual.</p>
<p>[2] But not all of us went back to business as usual. The challenge posed by
the new musicology was to formalism. This challenge hit a raw nerve among
theorists, for our field thrives not on unanchored observations but on aural and
visual observations that, however heterogeneously motivated, are gathered into
coherent form. Some left New York still unable to imagine life as
post-formalists. For others, however, the intellectual force of the new
musicological challenge to music theory was such that, even if they remained
deeply skeptical, they were compelled to begin thinking about fresh ways of
practicing music theory that would escape the limitations of formalism.</p>
<p>[3] Contemporary American music theory is best thought of as a constellation
of practices. Indeed, music theory has always been a pluralistic discipline even
though certain institutional representations of it have come to suggest that
Schenker, sets, and a dose of the history of theory are the things that a
well-trained theorist should command. But pluralism does not eschew hierarchies.
The pluralist profile speaks to intellectual freedom and ensures that no matter
what they are or how they are conceived, our ideas will find an audience of at
least one. In practice, however, effective pedagogy demands that one approach or
another predominate at a given historical moment. And what predominates in turn
is determined not necessarily by intellectual cogency but by practical or
pragmatic factors, including a given theory&rsquo;s &ldquo;pedagogability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[4] It was a wise move on the part of the Society of Music Theory to seek to
involve theorists who operate outside the United States. Such a move may in
principle lead to the rejuvenation of theory by bringing us into contact with
other methodologies. It may also reassure us that we are not doing badly after
all, that the capitalist machine has in fact made it possible for us to be the
pacesetters. Those among us with imperial ambitions will find the prospect of
internationalizing music theory welcome, an inevitable byproduct of broader
processes of globalization. Those of us alert to the negative consequences of
other peoples&rsquo; imperial ambitions will look upon these developments with some
trepidation.</p>
<p>[5] It is a matter for debate whether our guests represent radically
different intellectual orientations, or whether the only difference between us
and them is that they had to obtain visas in order to enter the U.S., or that
they speak with accents. (Does anyone not speak with an accent?) But the topic
of otherness is both complex and dangerous, and is perhaps best left to those
who have appropriated the right to construct their own and&mdash;especially&mdash;others&rsquo;
subjectivities. Still, the stated intent of this plenary session, which is to
expand the purview of music-theoretical thinking in the United States by
incorporating international perspectives, seems to me to be entirely
worthwhile.</p>
<p>[6] The four papers in this session are of course different from one another,
although there are points of resonance among them. Jose Luis Martinez draws on
Peircean semiotics to develop a comprehensive framework for the analysis of
Indian art music. Danuta Mirka, departing from within the proto-semiotic field
of structuralism, explores logical relations among the constituent parameters of
texture in order to illuminate the sonoristic style of Polish composer
Penderecki. Nicolas Meeus seeks an efficient way of explaining harmonic
progression in European music of both the tonal and pretonal periods. And Willie
Anku writes about rhythmic procedure in traditional African music using an
analytical methodology influenced by notions of rhythmic sets and their
compositional manipulation.</p>
<p>[7] Although American theory is not overwhelmingly preoccupied with these
topics, it is by no means unsympathetic to the issues raised. Thanks, for
example, to the contributions of people like Nattiez, Monelle, Lidov, Tarasti,
Dunsby, and Hatten the semiotic gospel can be read in French- and
English-speaking communities. And although fundamental questions remain as to
what semiotics finally achieves (is it a way of framing what we know already, or
can it release first-order musical insights?) the force of certain prominent
demonstrations of semiotic rationale has been decisive in helping some American
theorists to overcome the urge to resist semiotics. In this respect, the papers
of Martinez and Mirka could play a role in heightening semiotic awareness.</p>
<p>[8] Similarly, the field of harmonic theory to which Dr. Meeus&rsquo;s paper
belongs, is of course one of the backbones of American theory. In this, our
largely Schenkerian age, non-Schenkerian approaches to harmony are encountered
by students in courses that are historical&mdash;occasionally antiquarian&mdash;in
orientation. And yet, the growing attempts to rehabilitate certain ideas of
under the banner of neo-Riemannian theory serve as a salutary reminder that
harmonic and even voice-leading life may well exist outside Schenker&rsquo;s
intellectual purview. Finally, Anku&rsquo;s paper, although it deals with a repertoire
that is largely unfamiliar to American theorists, invests in a
quantitatively-oriented descriptive approach that is very familiar to theorists.
By urging us to study African repertoires not as repositories of certain
mystical essences but as structure, temporal projections of considered musical
behaviors aiming to make an aesthetic impact, Anku performs a service with which
theorists are deeply sympathetic.</p>
<p>[9] Obviously, then, the intellectual orientations of our visitors from
abroad pose no serious threat to the profile of American music theory (on the
surface, at least). This state of affairs must be comforting to some and
worrying to others. It would be especially worrying to those who had hoped to
use this occasion to court difference and now find themselves deprived of that
opportunity.</p>
<p>[10] Let me turn now to the individual papers and comment on each
briefly.</p>
<p>[11] Dr. Meeus is concerned with efficient and comprehensive ways of
understanding chordal succession and tonal progression. Starting with the
corrective remark that Rameau&rsquo;s <i>basse fondamentale</i> is not about chord
inversion but about chord progression, Meeus reviews competing interpretations
of relative strength in harmonic progression. Opposing the view that tonality is
precompositional (that is, prior to any specific usage), he elaborates a concept
of harmonic substitution, explaining progressions of a 2nd, for example, in
terms of substitution. Then he takes a paradigmatic or well-formed tonal phrase
I-IV-V-I and shows how it is made up of so-called &ldquo;dominant
progressions&rdquo; (Rameau&rsquo;s term). He ends by applying this conception of
phrase to a comparative statistical analysis of tonal and pre-tonal music. The
results are perhaps not entirely surprising. Whereas the proportion of dominant
progression to subdominant progression in tonal music is 75% to 25% (or 80-20),
that in pre-tonal progression is roughly 50-50. And where tonal progressions,
according to Meeus [13], can be fully construed on four roots only, pretonal
musics need six or seven roots, sometimes more. And where tonal progressions are usually based
on sequences of dominant progressions, pretonal musics have sequences of
subdominant progressions. (Incidentally, there are strong resonances between
this work and that of American theorist Allen Irvine McHose, whose <i> Contrapuntal
Harmonic Technique of the 18th Century</i> of 1947 remains obscure).</p>
<p>[12] Dr. Meeus attempts to pack a great deal into a short paper, the result
being that some points are not fully elaborated. It would be helpful to learn,
for example, which repertories might be surveyed by one who wishes to test the
applicability of his theory. In what sense is the recuperation of Rameau&rsquo;s <i>basse
fondamentale</i> as a theory of chord progression a radical interpretation? How
does this square with Schenker&rsquo;s verdict that with the Traite &ldquo;the seeds of
death already had penetrated into music theory and indirectly into
composition&rdquo; (Das Meisterwerk III, essay &ldquo;Rameau or Beethoven&rdquo;)?
Finally, in view of the recent growth of interest in sub-surface voice leading
focused on adjacencies, how might one begin to reconcile explanations that take
the periodic phrase as point of departure with those premised on arhythmic and
abstract harmonic progression?</p>
<p>[13] Willie Anku&rsquo;s paper is a contribution to the theory of rhythm of African
music. Rhythm is, of course, the hotly contested issue in writing about African
music, and although there is a certain amount of hot air in such writing, there
are genuine and fundamental disagreements among authors. Anku takes ensemble
musics of Ghana, specifically Adowa and Bawa dance drumming, as the site for
developing his theory. His aim, in part, is to explain as precisely as possible
the ways in which the master drummer&rsquo;s ostensibly improvised patterns, which are
also the most elaborate of the entire ensemble, are organized. But before he
can get to the master drummer, he needs to explain how a typical drum ensemble
works, how the individual rhythms are structured and coordinated. This in turn
entails the development of an appropriate vocabulary for naming various
procedures.</p>
<p>[14] One striking thing about Dr. Anku&rsquo;s paper is the extent to which it
manages to integrate insider and outsider views, indeed to render the
distinction between insider and outsider deeply problematic. He stresses the
importance of &ldquo;ethnically perceived norms of beat perception&rdquo; in order
to give priority, at the compositional level, to those who actually carry these
musical traditions. (He might have added that the dance or choreographic
supplement provides the strongest clue to metrical orientation in West African
music.) On the other hand, he does not hold back from adopting apparently
foreign&rsquo; tools, tools from atonal theory that allow him to express certain
structural properties concisely.</p>
<p>[15] Three issues that we might discuss are, first, the claim that the three
types of set have specific extra-musical connotations in the culture: 12-set is
associated with serious social and festive music, 16-set with recreational or
light music, and the cross set with ritual worship. As far as I know, no one has
previously made this correlation, even though other writers (such as Gerhard
Kubik) have often emphasized the historical depth of so-called time lines.
Second is the very conception of rhythmic sets in African music as well as the
corollary tendency to understand progression in terms of circles as distinct
from lines. Is this so different from European music based on cycles? Third, is
the demonstration of a high level of compositional planning in the master
drummer&rsquo;s part, planning based on the interpolation of sets, the use of
successive sets, the shifting of set orientations, the introduction of bridges
and waiting patterns, and so on. Is this planning structural? In other words, do
different performances of a given dance use the same procedures?</p>
<p>[16] Several questions also come to mind about Dr. Anku&rsquo;s paper. One of them
concerns the notion of time points. Is there any evidence from carriers of the
tradition that they are aware of the significance of the number of attack points
in a given set&mdash;say 7 in the standard pattern? In other words, is the morphology
of the set a western invention? A second and related question is whether the
additive conception of rhythm built into the matrixes of set structures 1 2 2 1
2 actually derives from indigenous conception.</p>
<p>[17] The cross-cultural approach developed by Dr. Anku holds the greatest
promise for our understanding of African musical procedures. By now we should
put away the aggressively nativist postures that seek to envelop African music
in mysticism even while refusing technical investigation. It may well be that
African music is more like European music than we have been willing to
grant.</p>
<p>[18] With Dr. Martinez we move from Africa to India, and from the narrowly
technical to a global framework for musical interpretation. Dr. Martinez is
concerned with developing a comprehensive framework for the analysis of Indian
art music. For this task, he has found some natural allies among the
semioticians, for the latter&rsquo;s totalizing schemes and promise of complete
control on all variables prove enticing to young people. An advocate for
Peircean semiotics, Martinez begins by proposing an analytical model comprising
three interrelated fields of inquiry dealing with intrinsic musical semiosis,
musical reference and musical interpretation. He then uses an Indian <i>raga
malkauns</i> composed by D. C. Vedi to explore each of the three fields of
inquiry.</p>
<p>[19] This is a wide-ranging inquiry that cannot be adequately summarized
here. Suffice it to say that Martinez&rsquo; model provides a home for internalist
analysis, externalist analysis (when music is construed as a set of symbols),
and various aspects of musical interpretation, ranging from historical through
the systematic. By its breath, Mr. Martinez&rsquo;s model is readily applicable to
other repertoires. Indeed, readers of Jean-Jacques Nattiez will recognize
similarities between his Molino-inspired tripartition and Martinez&rsquo;s
model.</p>
<p>[20] A model that attempts to cover all the bases, to file away all the
possible thoughts and utterances elicited by a musical work can leave you either
impressed with the range of its explanatory power or unmoved by its relatively
modest attention to purely musical relationships. Perhaps it is the idea of the
&ldquo;purely musical&rdquo; that is under siege here. And yet, despite the range
of information from various sources (systematic as well
as&mdash;especially&mdash;historical), the performative dimension of note-by-note
analysis, the semiosis of musical materiality, is given less prominence in this
paper than some might wish. It would be interesting to inquire into the
priorities enshrined in Dr. Martinez&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p>[21] Danuta Mirka&rsquo;s paper shows what can be gained from a narrower focus if
not on the music at least on sound. The specifically technical focus is only a
point of departure for her, however. For by the end of the paper, we have moved
from essentialized modes of dimensional behavior through a field of
combinatorial possibilities to larger questions of musical narration. The
advantage of deliberately setting limits at the start of an investigation are
thus made clear, rendering possible accusations of theoretical myopia thoroughly
impotent.</p>
<p>[22] The repertoire that Dr. Mirka analyzes is Penderecki&rsquo;s so-called
sonoristic style of the 1960s. If you approach this music armed with uninflected
notions of pitch or pitch class, your life may well be made greatly complicated.
But if proceed in terms of notions of sound masses, you will be on the right
track. Mirka begins by establishing the basic system of Penderecki&rsquo;s style by
positing certain oppositions in the three fundamental &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; of
pitch, loudness, and time. But classifying features neatly into discrete sets is
not always possible, for our ways of perceiving require mediative terms as well.
Mirka takes us then into the land of syntax, understood here to mean &ldquo;the
temporal order of segments in the course of a musical narration,&rdquo; and
explores competing arrangements of segments under the aegis of narrative. Just
when we thought structuralism was pass&eacute;, we find a fresh invocation of it that
helps to ground an analysis of style.</p>
<p>[23] From the foregoing summary it should be evident that framing a
discussion of all four papers together presents a formidable challenge. A check
list of issues raised reveals a network of affiliation. Elements of that network
include historical matters, including the status of music-theoretical treatises
(Meeus, Martinez), questions of style and relations between repertoires (Meeus,
Mirka and Anku), musical syntax (Anku, Mirka, Meeus and indirectly Martinez),
narrative (Mirka, but also, implicitly, Anku in what he says about the master
drum), non-Western music (Anku [Africa], Martinez [India]), structuralism and
semiology (Martinez and Mirka explicitly, Meeus implicitly) and notions of pitch
and rhythm sets (Anku [rhythm] and Mirka [sound masses]).</p>
<p>[24] What does a respondent do in the face of such heterogeneity?</p>
<p>[25] Although I was asked to draw lessons for American Theory from the
perspectives exposed by our four guests, I find myself at a loss as to what to
say. For, as I mentioned earlier, the familiarity of their approaches eliminates
any need for pontification on how Others can help us lead our theoretical lives
better. But I would like to conclude with two brief observations. The first
concerns foundations. Music theory is a foundationalist discipline. Indeed, it
is an aggressively foundationalist discipline. One reason for our attachment to
foundations stems from the pedagogical imperative that has been entrusted to us
in the American Academy. Yet the news from elsewhere in the Academy is of a skepticism
about foundations, a rethinking of what they enshrine or exclude, what they
enable or disable. In some extreme formulations, we are in a post-foundational
phase. Can we begin to imagine a post-foundational music theory? I am not sure
whether our guests can help us here, since each of their papers is concerned
either with laying down foundations or drawing upon existing ones. Still, it
seems to me that a radical questioning of the descriptive and procedural protocol
that we have long taken for granted is in order.</p>
<p>[26] Second and related, when foundations are enshrined in Theory and
deployed in something called Theory-based analysis, they do nothing but
reproduce themselves. It would be wise, then, in seeking to escape the
circularity of theory-based analysis, to return to an issue that exercised
several minds as far back as the 1960s, and to consider detaching theory from
analysis. Theory is closed, analysis open. A theory-based analysis does not push
at frontiers in the way that a non-theory-based one does. Theory is
foundational, analysis non-foundational. But analysis is also performance, and
its claims are to a different order of knowledge than, say, historical or
archival knowledge. Analytical knowledge is non-cumulative whereas theoretical
knowledge is cumulative. So it is possible that we would be doing analysis a
favor by detaching it from theory in order to pursue both with equal commitment.
I would not dare to suggest that the SMT become the SMAT [Society for Music
Analysis and Theory]&mdash;who knows what some mischievous graduate students will do
with that acronym? Nor do I mean to imply that analysis has not always been an
essential part of what we do. It has, of course. I mean rather to urge the
continuing cultivation of the more speculative kinds of analysis, that we can
more decisively call into question the foundations of our discipline,
foundations that may well prove ultimately unshakeable. In an ironic way, then,
the contributors of our guests serve as valuable pointers to roads not to be
taken if the aim is not to return to business as usual.</p>
