<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Less than a year after a conference covering the work of that
other icon of the 50&rsquo;s <i>avant garde</i>, John Cage,<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> the Institute
for New Music in Berlin hosted a series of lectures and concerts
with the stated goal of discussing the &ldquo;beginnings of serial
music.&rdquo; This year&rsquo;s event was obviously intended to be a bit
different from a more conventional conference or symposium. Only
four papers were presented, although their length (one-and-a-half
hours apiece) compensated for the small number. Each paper was to
focus on one particular composition taken from the serial
repertoire, and each composition thus discussed would also be
performed in concert, together with other works chosen to round
out the program. The compositions chosen as points of focus (and
the four composers represented) were apparently intended to
provide, in some way, an insight into &ldquo;what serialism was all
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[2] Attractive as this idea may be in theory, two problems arose
in practice. The first problem was clear before the series began:
the planned performance of Goeyvaert&rsquo;s <i>Composition No. 2</i> had to
be canceled because the instrumentalists required to perform the
piece could not be found among the students of the Berlin
<i>Hochschule der K&uuml;nste</i> (HdK). Similarly, a closing concert that
would have included Webern&rsquo;s <i>Concerto for Nine Instruments</i>,
Nono&rsquo;s <i>Polifonica-Monodia-Ritmica</i>, and Stockhausen&rsquo;s
<i>Kreuzspiel</i> was canceled. This is a disturbing state of affairs,
particularly since there are doubtless students at the HdK
technically capable of playing the music, and comparable programs
have been executed successfully in the past.</p>

<p>[3] A second problem relates more directly to the central idea of
the series: is it possible to adequately represent the
&ldquo;beginnings of serial music&rdquo; (or, for that matter, anything about
serial music) through four compositions, or even through four
composers? The question at hand, of course, is the extent to
which the following four presentations succeeded in this
enterprise.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Pascal Decroupet on Karlheinz Stockhausen&rsquo;s <i>Klavierst&uuml;ck VI</i></b></p>

<p>[4] Decroupet reiterated several points about Stockhausen&rsquo;s
approach to serial composition that ought to be well-known:
Stockhausen&rsquo;s liberties with &ldquo;pure&rdquo; serial technique (perhaps
best-documented in <i>Gruppen</i>, but also to be found in the
<i>Klavierst&uuml;cke</i>); his departure from a pointillist approach to
more &ldquo;statistical&rdquo; methods (although study of his writings in
<i>Texte</i> leave some doubt as to how well he understood
Meyer-Eppler&rsquo;s lectures on information theory at Bonn
University); and that his studies of Webern, which he cites as
the prime source of his own serialist ideas, postdate his first
contacts with Boulez, which were crucial for the development of
Stockhausen&rsquo;s serial composition. Decroupet&rsquo;s suggestion that
Stockhausen may have been aware of Cage&rsquo;s <i>Music of Changes</i>
immediately after its first performance, and that this may have
influenced his ideas on group form, is perhaps less well-known.</p>

<p>[5] A discussion of <i>Klavierst&uuml;ck VI</i> played only a small part
of Decroupet&rsquo;s presentation, which provided a rambling summary of
a variety of Stockhausenian compositional techniques,
occasionally showing how one or another may have found use in the
cycle of <i>Klavierst&uuml;cke V&ndash;X</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Marc Delaere on Karel Goeyvaerts&rsquo; <i>Composition No. 2</i></b></p>

<p>[6] Delaere adds Goeyvaerts to the list of composers who
influenced Stockhausen, citing Stockhausen&rsquo;s correspondence with
both Goeyvaerts and Nono, to the latter of whom Stockhausen
confided great admiration for Goeyvaerts&rsquo; work. It is thus
somewhat surprising (at least to the naive) that Goeyvaerts&rsquo;
letters to Stockhausen are no longer available and that
Stockhausen may have played some role (albeit a minor one) in the
program scheduling at the &lsquo;52 Darmstadt summer courses, which
resulted in a performance of Goeyvaerts relatively conventional
2nd Violin Concerto instead of his more radically serial
<i>Composition No. 2</i> (arguably the first &ldquo;serial&rdquo; composition,
predating <i>Kreuzspiel</i> by several months).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p>[7] The discussion of the composition in question was coupled with a
presentation of Goeyvaerts&rsquo; <i>Composition No. 1,</i> a sonata for two
pianos. Comparison of the techniques used in these two works is
enlightening. The earlier piece shows clear influences from <i>Mode de
valeur et d&rsquo;intensit&eacute;</i>. (Goeyvaerts, like many of his contemporaries,
took part in Messiaen&rsquo;s analysis class.) It uses two unordered
representatives of set class 7-22 as the basis for his harmonic and
registral ordering of pitch class material. Values for duration,
articulation, and dynamics for every note are determined by a set of
arithmetic dependencies between the various parameters.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Composition
No. 2 uses a similar but more complex strategy, involving the
parameters pitch, duration, dynamic, timbre, and articulation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Heribert Henrich on Jean Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s <i>Sonate pour piano</i></b></p>

<p>[8] Barraqu&eacute; is considered by many to be an unjustly neglected
composer. The reasons for neglect include his untimely death in
1973, a relatively small oeuvre, and a publication list
consisting of one essay (compare this with Stockhausen&rsquo;s <i>Texte</i>
or Boulez&rsquo; collections of essays and <i>Penser</i> monographs).
Henrich notes a certain ambivalence in Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s approach to
serialism as well as an awareness of contradictions in the
technique, describing his attitude as &ldquo;distanced&rdquo; (quoting
Barraqu&eacute; as saying that to all serial rules there are
exceptions). This manifests itself in the <i>Sonate pour piano</i>
(dated 1950&ndash;52) through an alternation of &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; and more
freely composed sections. Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s serialism extends from the
use of a twelve-tone row to related structures determining tempo,
dynamics, and register.</p>

<p>[9] Henrich pointed out a striking contradiction between the
voice leading intended by the serial composition and that which
is perceived.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> As was pointed out in the discussion after the paper, Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s counterpoint could extend to immediate
juxtapositions of the same pitch in two different voices, giving
the impression of a single voice with a repeated tone.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Thomas B&ouml;sche on Pierre Boulez&rsquo; <i>Deuxieme Sonate pour piano</i></b></p>

<p>[10] B&ouml;sche&rsquo;s presentation focused more on clearing up some
perennial misconceptions surrounding serial technique than on
Boulez&rsquo; piano sonata <i>per se</i>. One source of these misconceptions
may well have been Ligeti&rsquo;s famous analysis of Boulez&rsquo; <i>Structures
Ia</i>, which B&ouml;sche credited with &ldquo;devastating effects&rdquo; on the
reception of serial music. Indeed, any claim (as suggested by
Ligeti&rsquo;s essay) that there were a single, coherent, serial
aesthetic is belied by the minute sample of serial music covered
in these four lectures. The myth that serial music (and, as a
special case, twelve-tone music) literally requires the
performance of all the other eleven pitch classes between
occurrences of any given pitch class was discredited yet again;
to counter the claim that serial music is mechanistic or lacks
emotion and feeling, B&ouml;sche proceeded to read a list of
performance directions from Boulez&rsquo; 2nd Sonata: <i>extr&ecirc;ment
rapide</i>; <i>tr&egrave;s marqu&eacute;</i>, <i>sec percut&eacute;</i>, <i>bien donner une
impression de groupe</i>; <i>cedez</i>; <i>tr&egrave;s sec et tr&egrave;s arrach&eacute;</i> ...
(a complete enumeration continues considerably longer).</p>

<p>[11] B&ouml;sche did point out one difficulty of serial music, which
he referred to as the dichotomy (not to say discrepancy) between
the aesthetics of production and reception. In light of the
previous discussion of Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s counterpoint, Boulez is hardly
a solitary case, but the 2nd Sonata is certainly a case in
point.<p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Concerts</b></p>

<p>[12] As mentioned in the introduction, the ensemble performances
had been canceled, leaving a series of piano recitals performed
by Pi-Hsien Chen, Frank Gutschmidt, Herbert Henck, Jens Kaiser,
and Catherine Vickers, with one concert dedicated to each of the
composers whose works had been discussed.</p>

<p>[13] The opening concert presented Stockhausen&rsquo;s <i>Klavierst&uuml;cke
I&ndash;V</i> (Gutschmidt) followed by <i>Klavierst&uuml;ck VI</i> (Chen). This
grouping of the piano pieces (which, on the surface, runs counter
to Stockhausen&rsquo;s grouping into <i>Werknummern</i>) is justified
historically (the premier performances occurred in the same
grouping) and, in light of the length of the sixth piano piece
(well over twenty minutes, whereas the other five pieces together
are not quite as long), makes sense. Both performers played
excellently, although the pieces seemed (to this auditor) in some
way less fresh, less exciting, less <i>radical</i> than the first time
they were heard. Boulez&rsquo; criticism of the first four, that the
pieces were in themselves too uniform (and which Stockhausen
seems to have taken to heart through his three revisions of
<i>Klavierst&uuml;ck VI</i>), seemed apt.</p>

<p>[14] The Goeyvaerts concert, a matinee, featured the Composition
No. 2 (Chen and Vickers) and, as a substitute for the canceled
<i>Composition No. 1</i>, his 1974 composition <i>Litanei 1</i> (Vickers). The
performance of the 1952 piano duo confirmed several hypotheses
made during the morning&rsquo;s discussion of the work: the large-scale
structuring of the piece through sections of slower and faster
tempi (an important compositional principle for Goeyvaerts in
this work) seemed less apparent than a small-scale additive
concatenation of individual sections and gestures. The later
composition was refreshing, partially simply because it was so
very different from the rest of the music played. It had been
remarked that Goeyvaerts had been influenced by minimalism in
this work, which, indeed, is built from the overlapping of
repeated rhythmically distinct phrases. Nevertheless, the
language used is clearly different from that of <i>Reich and Riley</i>;
the repetition and rhythmic clarity still retain a certain
affinity with Goeyvaerts earlier music.</p>

<p>[15] Herbert Henck played Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s Sonata for piano the evening
of the same day. Oddly enough, it was in this piece that the
rather harsh bass of the Kawai grand used in all the concerts was
most evident and less than complimentary towards Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s use
of sforzandi in the lowest octave. Another, somewhat odd point,
is that the &ldquo;dichotomy between aesthetics of production and
reception&rdquo; discussed in the context of Boulez, were, if anything,
more in evidence in the performance of Barraqu&eacute;&rsquo;s music. Some
sections may be more rigorously serially composed than others,
but which ones are which escaped this listener. This is not to
deny that the music carries considerable beauty, but it is
disappointing not to be able to audibly follow the intended
formal disposition of the piece.</p>

<p>[16] In contrast, the formal structure of Boulez&rsquo; 2nd Piano
Sonata (Kaiser, final concert) seemed readily apparent.
The first movement, with its exposition (of two contrasting
sections), repeat of the exposition, development section, and
recapitulation, is practically a textbook Sonata Allegro, albeit
with Boulez&rsquo; characteristic manipulation of small rhythmic
cells and his uncompromisingly atonal harmonic language. The
overall structure of the four movements (Extr&ecirc;ment
rapide&mdash;Lent&mdash;mod&eacute;r&eacute;, presque vif&mdash;Vif) also follows a familiar
model, with the second and third movements each capturing a
certain atmosphere unmistakably reminiscent of Beethovenesque
archetypes. The final movement cannot be so readily classified,
although studies of the work also turn up an historical model.
Kaiser&rsquo;s performance gave the piece a patently expressive, almost
romantic, quality, without abating the aggressiveness of the
acoustic tone intended by the composer.</p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>Closing Discussion</b></p>

<p>[17] Diether Schnebel commenced the closing discussion by
thanking the participants for helping &ldquo;make the music of the 50&rsquo;s
come to life.&rdquo; One cannot help but wonder at the irony of an
Institute for New Music that seems more concerned with music
written nearly half a century ago than with the music of the
current decade. (In fairness, it should be added that the
Institute does host other, more contemporaneous events.)</p>

<p>[18] What is even more surprising to this correspondent is that
the focus of these three days should be so exceedingly narrow. It
was as if the only serial music ever written was within an
imaginary Franco-Germanic border, with Darmstadt its official
capital and Cologne and Paris the effective sites of business.
Nono was mentioned but once in passing, other Italian serialists
not at all. That Blacher was not mentioned is perhaps excusable
(his serial metrics are relatively primitive and more peripheral
to serial thought); that no mention was made of Babbitt or other
American serialists is simply incomprehensible. In reviewing
serial music at the end of the 20th century, it should be
possible to present a broader historical context.</p>
