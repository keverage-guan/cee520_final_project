<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Seize the Dance is an ethnographic study of performance (viewed as a
complex of expressive forms including music, dance, and text) among the BaAka
people, one of the many groups of the African equatorial rainforest zone that
are awkwardly referred to by outsiders as &ldquo;pygmies.&rdquo; Reviews of this
sort of study probably appear infrequently in this journal, and I must confess
at the outset some trepidation in presenting this monograph to music theorists.
Kisliuk simply does not emphasize BaAka musical structure (she describes and
transcribes musical performances or parts thereof, but this is done in a
fragmented fashion throughout much of the book), nor does she attempt (and for
good reason) to articulate norms or rules of performance practice that would
help a newcomer to this music conceptualize the generative processes in play
during performance. Rather, she treats music as one form of expressive culture
that is combined with others in performance events, of which there are many
types. The author focuses primarily on &ldquo;reading&rdquo; these performance
events, i.e., interpreting community dynamics within these events and also
interpreting BaAka adaptations/responses to their changing world. Kisliuk thus
is a &ldquo;music theorist,&rdquo; if one is willing to define the term broadly.
She &ldquo;beholds&rdquo; the BaAka and their music, and relates to us the
experience of seeking understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[2] Perhaps the most striking feature of this ethnography is the manner in
which it is conceived and written. The author describes her work as an example
of &ldquo;socioesthetics&rdquo; in which she emphasizes &ldquo;the elements of
experience and interaction, leaving room for choice, irony, contradiction, and
surprise&rdquo; (page 12). She contrasts her approach to that of &ldquo;ethnoesthetics,&rdquo;
which seeks to articulate underlying coherence systems of a circumscribed
&ldquo;people&rdquo; often by conveniently underestimating &ldquo;the particulars
of time and place, the variability of social situations, the possibility of
internal contradictions, and the immediate, multiplex consequences of power
politics&rdquo; (page 12). Largely, this study boils down to a narrative
presentation that takes the reader through the writer&rsquo;s own experiencing of her
encounters with her subjects and her ongoing attempts to interpret and
understand those experiences. As a result, the reader reads about the writer&rsquo;s
experiences in roughly the diachronic order in which they took place, and learns
much personal detail about the author&rsquo;s confrontations with the challenges of
fieldwork (health, bureaucratic, interpersonal, logistical) on someone else&rsquo;s
turf. Perhaps nowhere is the nature of this approach more dramatically
illustrated than when the author shares with her readers poems she wrote in
response to her experiences&mdash;one to express the complexity of what she was
encountering in the field (pages 44&ndash;45), the other in response to the murder of an
anonymous fellow cab passenger during a bandit attack (pages 171&ndash;172). Thus, one
should not expect while reading this book to be presented with reductive
representations of BaAka culture (&ldquo;the pygmies do this,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
dance represents that,&rdquo; &ldquo;the performance is structured thus&rdquo;).
Rather, one is carried along by the author as she grapples with the perplexing
events she encounters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[3] The centrality of experience in the author&rsquo;s approach is reflected in the
structure of the book itself. Topics (be they types of dances or issues such as
modernization and missionization) are introduced not within an overriding
taxonomic logic, but in the order in which they came to occupy the author&rsquo;s
attention while in the field. Chapter titles allude to issues (life in an
African forest; the politics of gender; missionaries and modernity) or to
specific categories of performance (elamba; mabo; women&rsquo;s dances) as these
issues and forms came to the fore of the author&rsquo;s unfolding experience. Thus, a
reader carrying into their reading of this book the expectation of finding
chapters focusing on instruments, tonal organization, vocal technique, drumming,
compositional practice, contexts of performance, musicians, and so forth will
most certainly be frustrated with this work in large part because the author
does not set out to describe BaAka musical performance in such terms. She is
much more interested in introducing the reader to real life individuals and
communities, and explaining how she came to understand THEM in large part
through their interactions during performance events. Understanding the MUSIC as
a logical system in itself is not, in my opinion, a major priority of the author
in this work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[4] That said, I hasten to add that the author does deal with musical
structure and performance practice to a small degree. Sprinkled throughout the
text are nearly two dozen notated musical examples of performances that are
included on two accompanying compact discs. But these notations are not full
transcriptions of performances or even segments of performances. Rather, they
typically serve as mini-inventories of some, but not all, of the basic rhythmic
and melodic ideas that appear in a performance. This approach to musical
representation selected by the author makes sense given the nature of the music
itself; performances of &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; are unbelievably organic and anything
but predetermined. Individuals phase in and out of a performance and repeat,
vary, or abandon a given melodic idea seemingly at will. There appears to be no
definitive musical essence for a given piece that will always be present in at
least part of every performance of it. Thus, for me, this work provides little
in the way of elucidating how a BaAka or other pygmy community can come together
and create, in a remarkably spontaneous and sustained fashion, very elaborate
polyphonic structures. If anyone could explain the workings of this music to me,
it is probably Kisliuk. However, as I have already mentioned, the thrust of her
study is in other directions and I and others will have to continue to enjoy our
disembodied encounters with this fascinating music without much of a clue as to
what makes it tick musically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[5] The music captured on the two accompanying compact discs is presented, I
feel, mainly to allow the reader to share in some small and mono-dimensional way
the performances experienced live by the author. References to the recordings in
the text are numerous, but the author does not expend much space and energy
describing the recordings. In regard to their content, the recordings are
fascinating and include many remarkable moments of music making. With the
exception of two commercially recorded selections of non-pygmy popular music,
the recordings are in situ documents of performance events that start and stop
unexpectedly and that include some extraneous sounds. They are meant to capture
the ambiance of the performance events themselves, not to produce well balanced,
carefully controlled recordings that are technically clean and commercially
viable. The author, on occasion, even carried her recorder and microphone into
the dance line, capturing what she heard from her perspective as a
participant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[6] So what is it that one learns from this book? Perhaps most importantly,
one can gain a more realistic understanding of the complexity of BaAka
existence. The book helps one challenge the romanticized image of pygmies as
forest dwellers leading a seemingly idealistic existence in egalitarian
communities, singing as they hunt and gather the rainforest&rsquo;s bounty. The true
picture is far more complicated. Most pygmies have extensive and complex
relationships with Bantu-speaking peoples (who they call milo) who live on the
edge of the rainforests. Many pygmies spend part of the year outside the forest
practicing sedentary agriculture or working wage-earning jobs. National
governments place varying degrees of pressure on their pygmy population to
integrate into mainstream national culture. Several missionary organizations
have aggressive programs to convert pygmies to Christianity. These forces, and
others, contribute to a continuously evolving BaAka identity. And one way of
grasping this evolving identity is to study and contemplate BaAka expressive/performative
culture. Kisliuk, rather than finding evidence to support the romantic
stereotypes of pygmy culture held by Westerners, reveals through her study of
and initiation into particular BaAka performance forms &ldquo;the particulars of time
and place, the variability of social situations, the possibility of internal
contradictions, and the immediate, multiplex consequences of power
politics&rdquo; (page 12) that are part of contemporary BaAka existence. I came
away from this book with a considerably more informed understanding of BaAka
performance as a revealing mode of social interaction through which to grasp the
realities of pygmy culture at this point in time.</p>
