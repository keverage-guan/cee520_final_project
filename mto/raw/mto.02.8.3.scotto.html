This characterization could divert attention away from investigating pitch structures in his compositions. Although some theoretical works have begun focusing attention on pitch, the scope of these investigations has been limited to the procedures associated with a limited number of symmetrical sets. Focusing solely on symmetrical sets could overshadow other methods of organizing pitch. Through an analysis of the solo piano work <i>Processional</i> (1983), I will demonstrate that Crumb&rsquo;s procedures include techniques that link the compositional opportunities symmetrical sets offer to the procedures associated with aggregate-based atonal composition. The analysis will reveal that symmetrical and non-symmetrical set structures in <i>Processional</i> are part of a larger group of relations that include techniques such as aggregate partitions, transpositional combination, and transformational networks. My analysis will also demonstrate how these techniques and the techniques associated with symmetrical sets blend to create a larger compositional universe. Finally, I will suggest a more general model for the various networks that appear in <i>Processional.</i></font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The propensity of some composers to gravitate towards a select group of 
  set classes as the source of musical structure in their works has become a type 
  of equivalence relation in recent theoretical writings that tends to group some 
  composers into two large classes. Richard Bass has noted that this bifurcated 
  view of pitch structure essentially places Schoenberg and his followers on one 
  side of the divide and on the other side are composers, such as Bartok, Stravinsky, 
  and Messiaen, whose compositional procedures are inextricably linked to symmetrical 
  set classes.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Another factor contributing 
  to this bifurcated view is the tendency to raise the status of symmetrical set 
  classes to be on par with but independent of the diatonic collection. That is, 
  symmetrical set classes are seen as functionally equivalent to their diatonic 
  counterparts in their capacity to function as referential collections that generate 
  musical structure. They are emancipated from the diatonic, because the structures 
  and procedures they produce do not need to be legitimized as originating with 
  the diatonic. The simultaneous functional association of symmetrical set classes 
  with the diatonic and functional emancipation of symmetrical set classes from 
  the diatonic widens the gap between the classes of composers, since the compositional 
  procedures of Schoenberg and his followers tend not to be seen through the same 
  referential filter. A passage from the conclusion of Bass&rsquo;s article implicitly 
  suggests that this might be the case:<br>
</p>
<blockquote> The octatonic and whole-tone elements in &ldquo;Music of Shadows,&rdquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>are 
  distinctive in their emancipation from any enlarged diatonic context. At the 
  same time, labels such as &ldquo;chromatic&rdquo; or &ldquo;atonal&rdquo; are too 
  general to account for the pitch-structural orientation of the piece. The interpenetration 
  of these referential collections is not without precedent, but Crumb&rsquo;s 
  specific approach is unique in its elevation of existing techniques to the level 
  of independent procedures capable of generating motivically unified, complete 
  musical structures<nobr>. . .</nobr> The ascendancy of aggregate-based atonal and serial 
  methods during the mid-twentieth century may have temporarily relegated these 
  symmetrical referential collections to a subordinate role, but recent works 
  by a number of composers provide evidence that the compositional opportunities 
  offered through interaction between octatonic, whole-tone, and related sonorities<nobr>. . .</nobr>were 
  not exhausted in the early part of the century. Crumb in particular has developed 
  clear and aurally accessible models for the integration of two, and sometimes 
  more, non-diatonic reference sets that stand on a par with diatonic and chromatic 
  writing within the broader spectrum of his eclectic harmonic language.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[2] Richard Cohn expounds a similar but more general view of symmetrical set 
  classes in his article &ldquo;Properties and Generability of Transpositionally 
  Invariant Sets.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> As Cohn&rsquo;s 
  article clearly states and Bass&rsquo; article implicitly states, the select 
  group of set classes that composers gravitate towards is the collection of transpositionally 
  invariant or transpositionally symmetrical set classes (see <b>Example 1a</b>). Cohn claims the gravitational pull of this collection of set classes 
  for a composer lies in their modes of generability. This means each member of 
  this select group is capable of being generated by a multitude of transformations 
  of its transpositionally related subsets, and conversely, each member of this 
  group can be disunited into a multitude of transpositionally related subsets. 
  <b>Example 1b</b>, adapted from Cohn&rsquo;s 
  article, illustrates that members from each of the set classes 2-2, 2-4, 3-8, 
  and 4-25, which are all members of Cohn&rsquo;s cyclic homomorphic equivalence 
  class [02] mod 6, generate a member of set class 4-25 under the operation of 
  transpositional combination with T<sub>6</sub> as the operand. Conversely, members 
  of set class 4-25 can be disunited into T<sub>6</sub> related members of the 
  generating set classes.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Modes of generability is the fundamental transformational process that, 
  according to Cohn, reduces the power of diatonic interaction as an explanation 
  for the popularity of the TINV family of sets. One might suppose that if the 
  ability to interact with the diatonic generated the utility of TINV sets classes, 
  then both collections would share some essential structural features. For example, 
  besides transpositional invariance, TINV set classes are also inversionally invariant, 
  a property TINV set classes share with the diatonic hexachord 6-32 [024579]. 
  Cohn notes, however, that TINV and diatonic collections rate below average on 
  any number of similarity scales. He goes on to say that dissimilarity is not, 
  of course, a prophylactic against TINV and diatonic interactions, nor is it 
  a preventative against raising those interactions to the level of forming a 
  compositional syntax, but the dissimilarity of the collections suggests that 
  a special relationship between the collections is not the source of their interaction. 
  Cohn cites historical/semantic reasons for why TINV collections might want to 
  legitimize themselves by associating with the more established member of the 
  diatonic, but &ldquo;given a diatonic collection as a compositional premise, 
  it is not yet clear why TINV collections should be chosen as playmates.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup><br>
</p>
<p>[4] One aim of this study is to build a little more of one particular bridge 
  across the canyon separating the two views of pitch structure. Cohn laid this 
  bridge&rsquo;s foundation by noting how modes of generability are related to 
  research in combinatoriality. The material for our bridge&rsquo;s roadway will 
  come from the diatonic collection of sets. Consequently, another aim of this 
  paper is to explore syntactic connections that make the diatonic and TINV collections 
  good playmates. We will explore these issues by means of an analysis of Crumb&rsquo;s 
  solo piano work <i>Processional</i> (1983). I will demonstrate that the work&rsquo;s 
  compositional procedures include techniques that link the opportunities TINV 
  collections offer to procedures associated with aggregate-based composition. 
  The analysis will also reveal that TINV and non-TINV set structures in <i>Processional</i> 
  are part of a larger group of relations that include techniques such as aggregate 
  partitions, transpositional combination, inversional symmetry, generalized CUP 
  relations, K-nets, and other transformational networks.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><br>
</p>
<p>[5] Before we begin, however, we need to establish a rule of the game. &ldquo;Aggregate-based 
  composition&rdquo; is a loaded expression that means many things to many people. 
  One association I would like to avoid is that aggregate-based composition implies 
  perceiving aggregate completion as a necessary foundation for comparing aggregates 
  and their contents. I don&rsquo;t want to avoid the sense of aggregate completion 
  requiring the presence of all twelve tones, but I would like to avoid the implication 
  of the aggregate as a perceptual unit that once perceived signals a change from 
  one aggregate to another. This form of aggregate completion is most often associated 
  with some forms of serial composition. In some serial contexts, we know we have 
  moved from one row form to another or from one aggregate to another, because 
  hearing the completion of an aggregate marks the boundary between aggregates. 
  We can discover the transformational relationship between two row forms or compare 
  the configuration of transformationally related subsets within each aggregate, 
  once the aggregate boundary has been perceived. Most often, the non-immediate 
  repetition of a pitch-class determines or can act as a signal that the aggregate 
  boundary has been reached. Since <i>Processional</i> uses unordered or non-serially 
  ordered collections, pitch-class repetition is an ineffective marker of aggregate 
  boundaries, because the repetition of a pitch-class does not signify aggregate 
  completion. Furthermore, any number of events can signal or be the impetus for 
  the change from one aggregate to the next. Aggregates in the present discussion 
  are, to use Robert Morris&rsquo; term, compositional spaces that are contained 
  within the larger compositional space produced by the transformational networks 
  that link aggregates. In <i>Processional,</i> the completion of one process 
  and the initiation of a new process often determine the change from one aggregate 
  to the next. In the former view, aggregate perception is necessary and it forms 
  the basis of local comparison, while in the latter view local comparison does 
  not depend on perceiving aggregates. I would also like to extend the concept 
  of an aggregate compositional space to include transformations as well pitch 
  classes. Object and process are inextricably intertwined in <i>Processional,</i> 
  so aggregate transformational structures often mirror aggregate pitch-class 
  structures. Furthermore, the concept of an aggregate transformational space 
  is one source of the work&rsquo;s coherence, since the space is closed with regard 
  to the particular transformation. Partitioning the aggregate transformational 
  space generates many of the work&rsquo;s formal divisions. As I will demonstrate, 
  these surface formations are the result of deeper or hidden processes.</p>

<p>[6] <i>Processional,</i> as a score and composition, has several features that 
  are worth noting. The score does not contain any barlines, except for double 
  bars that mark the work&rsquo;s large divisions. In many ways, the absence of barlines 
  is a visual indicator that underscores viewing the piece as a single unfolding 
  process, such as the process that takes a fertilized egg from single cell to 
  a multi-celled functioning organism. The score also lacks any of the usual timbral 
  devices, such a plucking the strings inside the piano, which are associated 
  with Crumb&rsquo;s music. The lack of extended timbral techniques focuses attention 
  on the work&rsquo;s pitch-class structures. Crumb does include a one page appendix 
  containing six <i>Ossia</i> passages with, in the composer&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;a 
  few extended piano effects,&rdquo; perhaps for players who may miss this aspect 
  of his music. Although the work lacks barlines and it is a single unfolding 
  process, it does divide up into several sub-processes (see <b>Example 2</b>). The work contains three large sections at the global level in the familiar 
  pattern A-B-A. The presence or absence of key signatures and the double bars 
  distinguish the A and B sections. The A sections each contain four sub-sections 
  that are distinguished by changing key signatures. Although the B section lacks 
  divisions marked by change of key, it also contains four sub-sections marked 
  by change of texture. Sections one and four are homophonic, section two is contrapuntal, 
  and section 3 is a hybrid homophonic/contrapuntal texture. <br>
</p>

<p>[7] <i>Processional</i> begins with a descending six-note motive that is a 
  member of the set-class 6-32[024579] commonly known as the diatonic hexachord 
  (<b>Example 3a</b>). Moving quickly to a 
  high level of generalization, however, bypasses many of the hexachord&rsquo;s 
  more important features and implications generated by its pitch realization. 
  The three semitone or interval class (hereafter ic) 3 &ldquo;gap&rdquo; at the 
  hexachord&rsquo;s center splits it into two trichordal subsets that are members 
  of set class 3-6[024]. Although many other pitch realizations, such as transposing 
  the lower trichord up an octave (<b>Example 3b</b>), produce similar results, the ic 3 gap at the hexachord&rsquo;s center 
  perhaps emphasizes both the independence of the 3-6[024] trichords and their 
  role in generating the larger set. The &ldquo;octave up&rdquo; pitch realization, 
  for example, may at a higher level of abstraction contain the same information, 
  but it is not quite set into the same relief, since it perhaps emphasizes the 
  hexachord and de-emphasizes the trichords. While the pitch realization of the 
  motive emphasizes the generative role 3-6[024] trichords may play in producing 
  the hexachord, it does not say anything definitive about the chosen generative 
  path. Perhaps the simplest transformational route would be by means of transpositional 
  combination (hereafter referred to as TC) of the lower trichord at T<sub>7</sub> 
  (see <b>Example 3c</b>). However, the arrangement 
  of the pitches around the gap also strongly suggests inversional symmetry at 
  T<sub>e</sub>I or inversional symmetry around the pitch dyad B3/C4, or more 
  generally IC/B, as alternate transformational routes.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup><br>

<p>[8] The inversional dyadic center plays another important role with regard 
  to another ambiguity created by this motive&rsquo;s pitch realization. The subset-superset 
  relation created by the trichord partitioning of the hexachord suggests inclusion 
  relations may play an important role in this work (<b>Example 4</b>). For example, including either member of the dual axis of symmetry around 
  which the 6-32 [024579] hexachord is constructed generates two different members 
  of the set class 7-35[013568t]. While the &ldquo;key signature&rdquo; of the piece 
  implies a 7-35[013568t] superset with a pitch class content of {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, F, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, C} for the 6-32[024579] hexachord, the pitch realization of the motive 
  and the choice of either pitch class B or C to fill the gap strongly suggests 
  the pitch class content of the member of the 7-35[013568t] set class could also 
  be {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, F}. We will return to the role the ambiguity plays 
  in the opening section of the work shortly. Combining both members of the dual 
  axis of symmetry with the 6-32[024579] hexachord constructed around the axis 
  produces a member of set class 8-23 [0123578t] whose complement is 4-23[0257], 
  a tetrachord important to the B section of the work.<br>
</p>


<p>[9] The trichord partitioning of the hexachord also suggests hexachords may 
  be part of a larger partitioning scheme. Each of the outlined transformational 
  routes, for example, determines a different partitional path that the motive 
  may travel in its development (<b>Example 5a</b>). Continuing on the TC path produces a series of T<sub>7</sub> related 3-6[024] 
  trichords. The T<sub>7</sub> path that generates trichords is suggestive, because 
  T<sub>7</sub> cycles of pitch classes generate the collections 6-32[024579], 
  7-35[013568t], and 8-23 [0123578t]. Of course, the new trichords maintain all 
  the structural features of the generating pair, but some of those features are 
  lost at the level of the hexachord. For example, unlike the trichords, the hexachords 
  do not maintain the non-intersecting pitch-class content feature of the trichords. 
  Continuing on the path of inversional symmetry, however, produces a new pair 
  of trichords that maintain the structural features of the generating pair, and 
  it produces a new hexachord that maintains the non-intersecting pitch-class 
  content feature of the trichords with the original hexachord (see <b>Example 5b</b>). The two diatonic hexachords, of course, produce the aggregate, since 
  their pitch-class content is non-intersecting or complementary with regard to 
  the total chromatic. If, however, the inversional center partitions the aggregate 
  rather than the diatonic hexachord, then the two hexachords generated by the 
  transformational schema are members of set class 6-35[02468T] or the whole tone 
  collection. As we shall see shortly, other combinations or partitions of this 
  aggregate&rsquo;s components produce other hexachordal profiles. Therefore, perhaps 
  rather than viewing any particular hexachord as being fundamental, the 3-6[024] 
  trichord and its transformational stance should be thought of as fundamental, 
  in the same way that plate tectonics is responsible for the surface formations 
  of the earth. That is, surface formations are the result of deeper or hidden 
  processes. <br>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>. Complementary Hexachord in Section 1</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="scotto_examples.php?id=9&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 6 thumbnail" src="scotto_ex06_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[10] The question now, of course, is how does this transformational model play 
  out in the music (see <b>Example 6</b>). While the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32 hexachord 
  settles into an ostinato, the pitch classes, 11, 7, 4, 9, 2, and 0 gradually 
  enter in the registers surrounding the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32 hexachord producing its complement 
  at T<sub>6</sub>. If, for the moment, we view the pitches outside the range of the model, 
  which is C3 through <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4 through B4, as a third registral stream, we 
  see that the new pitch material with one very important exception completes 
  the inversional transformational schema begun by the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32 hexachord.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
  The C3 of the model is the exception, since it always appears as C4, one of 
  the pitches from the inversional center. The deviation from the model is the 
  result of two special functions pitch class 0 performs in this section. It is 
  one of two pitch classes that can deny or confirm the implied seven-note collection 
  of the key signature. It is also the pitch class that completes the aggregate. 
  Both of these functions come into play at the end of the first section.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Although the C4 completes the pitch-class aggregate in the third system 
  of Example 6, 
  the action within this aggregate compositional space continues, because the 
  process behind the procession in this section of <i>Processional</i> has not 
  reached its completion. Prior to this point, the ostinato hexachord has not 
  remained unaffected by the procession of notes around it. It constantly reinvents 
  its set-class profile by losing its own members, acquiring members from its 
  complement, or both losing and acquiring new members. Although the full implications 
  of how these changes contribute to the structure of the work are beyond the 
  scope of this paper, we can examine one or two key relationships. For example, 
  with the first appearance of B2 in the outer stream, the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 disappears from 
  the center stream (see Example 6). The pitch-class exchange produces a new hexachordal 
  set class, 6-33 [023579]. Assuming for a moment a more tonally oriented hearing, 
  the change of hexachord could be heard as a &ldquo;shift&rdquo; from a major to 
  minor sound. The G4 entrance following the appearance of B2 replaces B2, but 
  it maintains the hexachordal set class 6-33 [023579]. The appearance of E3 two 
  eighth notes later is marked by the reappearance of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 generating the work&rsquo;s 
  first seven-note collection, a member of set class 7-23 [0234579]. The appearance 
  of 7-23 marks the end of the work&rsquo;s first sub-process, since it fuses or 
  unites the 6-32 and 6-33 hexachords into a single seven-note collection that 
  subsumes both hexachords. The music needs to continue, however, because the 
  larger process, which is related to the appearance of 7-23, has not reached 
  it conclusion. That is, the appearance of 7-23 does nothing to disambiguate 
  which member of the 7-35 set class the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-35 hexachord will become, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 7-35 
  or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 7-35.<br>

<p>[12] When the aggregate is finally completed with the entrance of the C4, the 
  process of hexachordal reinvention continues. For example, the C4 entrance produces 
   
  a 6-Z28 [013569] with four members of the opening 6-32 hexachord {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  F, and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>} along with A4 from the opening hexachord&rsquo;s complement.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
  Once C4 is introduced, it remains, for the most part, a member of the pitch 
  sets formed by the ostinato (<b>Example 7</b>). Although the ostinato process 
  continues to produce members of various set classes, it eventually settles on 
  the member of 7-35 that confirms the key signature, {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, F, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  C}. C4 is the only pitch from the complementary hexachord that is allowed to 
  invade the registral space of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32 hexachord, and the union of C4 with 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32, not the completion of the aggregate, is the event that brings the section 
  to its end. The completion of the aggregate does, however, play the role of 
  triggering the event that does bring the section to its close.<br>

<p>[13] Although the inversional transformational schema models the pitch realization 
  of the 3-6[024] trichords, a more general pitch-class transpositional network 
  based on TC relations produces another model of the four 3-6[024] trichords 
  that better explains their relationship to other structural features of the 
  composition. Taking the pc set {024} as the point of origin or T<sub>0</sub>, 
  the remaining trichords relate to it by T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>6</sub>, and T<sub>7</sub> 
  (<b>Example 8a</b>). In this model, combinations 
  of interval cycle 6 or C6, following Perle and Cohn, generate the four trichords.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
  An interesting consequence of this generative process is that it has two faces 
  that are revealed by exchanging object and process in the matrix. If the transformational 
  process, T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>6</sub>, T<sub>7</sub> becomes 
  the pitch class set {0167}, and the pitch class set {024} becomes the transformational 
  process T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>4</sub>, the new process generates 
  a differently partitioned aggregate from members of set class 4-9[0167]. Applying 
  the T<sub>(024)</sub> process to the original matrix produces an interesting 
  and related result. <b>Example 8b</b> illustrates, 
  that the three matrices produce all twelve transpositions of the 3-6[024] trichord, 
  which represents another level of saturation. The exchange of process and object 
  in this aggregate generating context creates a bond between two set classes 
  that do not rate very highly on any of the conventional similarity scales, and 
  it bonds a member of the TINV collection with a set class from outside its world. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[14] The T<sub>(0167)</sub> transformation is not the only cyclic generator 
  of the aggregate bonded to the 3-6[024] trichord. When the pitch C4 completed 
  the aggregate, it did so against a 6-Z28 [013569] hexachordal backdrop. This 
  hexachord weaves together the {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, F} 3-6 trichord together with a member 
  of set class 4-28[0369], a set class whose interval structure links it to the 
  interval class 3 that separates the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32&rsquo;s 3-6 trichords and the T<sub>(0167)</sub> 
  transformation that generates the 3-6[024] trichords of the first section. As 
  <b>Example 9</b> illustrates, translating 
  4-28 from object to process and applying the process to the pitch class set 
  {024} produces another partitioning of the aggregate using 3-6[024] trichords. 
  The T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix pairs two trichords from the T<sub>(0167)</sub> 
  with a new pair. Applying T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> to the T<sub>(0369)</sub> 
  matrix produces two new matrices that in combination with the first matrix produce 
  all twelve members of set class 3-6[024] (Example 
  9b). All of the trichordal relationships can be extended to the hexachordal 
  level by applying the same TC operation that produced the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32 hexachord 
  from the 3-6 trichords to each of the T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrices. For example, 
  combining the T<sub>1</sub> matrix with T<sub>5</sub> of itself produces a hexachordal 
  matrix containing the T<sub>6</sub> related 6-32[024579] hexachords from the 
  first section (see <b>Example 10a</b>). 
  Applying the same process to the T<sub>0</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> matrices produces 
  two new matrices that in combination with the first matrix produce all twelve 
  members of set class 6-32[024579] (see <b>Example 10b</b>). As Example 10b illustrates the columns containing identical trichords 
  can function as bridges facilitating movement from one matrix to another. The 
  type of saturation exemplified by the complex of matrices plays a critical role 
  in the architecture of <i>Processional.</i><br>
</p>
<p>[15] The work&rsquo;s second section, demarcated in the score by the change 
  of key signature from five flats to four sharps and demarcated in the processional 
  by another process, continues the homophonic texture from the end of the previous 
  section (see <b>Example 11</b>). Although the new section 
  continues the previous section&rsquo;s texture, the processes generating musical 
  development begin all over again. The first chord of section two, E 6-32[024579], 
  repeats the generative role played by the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] hexachord in section 
  one. Its two constituent 3-6[024] trichords are arranged in pitch space to produce 
  the 3 semitone or ic 3 gap, for example. In fact, the entire structural complex 
  of relationships attributed to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] apply to E 6-32[024579], since 
  they are T<sub>3</sub> transformations of each other in both pitch class and 
  pitch. The transpositional relationships shared by the generative hexachords 
  in both sections imply that the inversional transformational model of section 
  one might likewise be transposed and at work in section two. As example 11 illustrates, 
  the notes of the complementary hexachord, {G, D, F, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, C, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>}, quickly enter 
  and complete the aggregate space. If, for the moment, we ignore the pitches 
  outside the center stream range of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 through <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 and E4 through D5, we see 
  that the new pitch material with one very important exception produces a T<sub>3</sub> 
  transposition of the model in pitch class and pitch.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The one exception is <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, and once again it is one of a pair of pitch 
  classes that can confirm or deny the 7-35[013568t] collection implied by the 
  key signature. Pitch class 3&rsquo;s special status is once again confirmed by 
  one of its representatives, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, since <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 is the only pitch allowed to invade 
  the registral space of the E 6-32[024579] hexachord. In section two, however, 
  the collection confirming pitch class takes on a more subversive role by revealing 
  that its allegiance may actually be with the other hexachordal set class of 
  the model, the whole tone collection or 6-35[02468t]. Section one ended with 
  a stabilization of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 7-35 produced by C4 forming a union with <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32. Section 
  two ends with a rising whole tone collection beginning on G3 and ending on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 
  that undermines any attempt of the chords to establish an E 7-35[013568t] collection 
  (see Example 11). 
  The significance of this development will shortly become evident.<br>
</p>


<p>[17] Sections one and two present several musical streams, the homophonic texture 
  of the middle register and the single note events that unfold around the center 
  form two streams.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Each stream 
  unfolds complementary related hexachords. Focusing on the center stream for 
  a moment reveals that its transpositional process is directly related to the 
  T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix of Example 
  10b, since the first two hexachords of the matrix are the hexachords unfolded 
  in the center stream. The outer registral stream simply follows a rotated version 
  of the matrix related to the original matrix by T<sub>6</sub>. These relationships 
  are more easily graphed by collapsing each hexachord into its first pitch class 
  and taking that pitch class as a representative of the hexachord and as a representative 
  of the member of the cycle generating the matrix (see <b>Example 12</b>). In the example, the number 1 represents the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 7-32[024579] hexachord 
  and the 1 of the 1-4-7-t (0369) cycle that generates the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> 
  matrix. While Example 12 is a graph 
  of the actual streams of sections one and two, it is also a projection of how 
  the streams might continue. Both the T<sub>1</sub> matrix and each stream of 
  the graph contain a natural partition that divides each object into two parts. 
  The hexachords <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] and E 6-32[024579] each share three common tones 
  and are on one side of the divide, while their complements, G 6-32[024579] and 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] also share three common tones and are on the other side of the 
divide. The graph of Example 12 reveals another perspective on the 
  relationship of complementary hexachords. In the second half of the graph, the 
  hexachords from the outside stream move inside and vice versa. <br>
</p>

<p>[18] While each half of the T<sub>1</sub> T(0369) matrix and each 
  half the graph contain complementary hexachords, adjacent hexachords in the 
  T<sub>1</sub> T(0369) matrix and in the individual streams of the 
  graph share three common tones. Furthermore, the non-common tones are all adjacent 
  pitch classes. As the joint between sections one and two illustrates, these 
  pitch class properties translate into extremely smooth or parsimonious voice 
  leading in the pitch dimension (see <b>Example 13</b>). The pitches of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] 
  hexachord connect to the pitches of the E 6-32[024579] hexachord by common tone 
  or half step motion. Common tones link the outer stream as well, but in a different 
  manner. In section one, two pitches, B2 and A2, that are members of a third 
  registral stream but were in essence temporarily relegated to the role of octave 
  duplications of the inversional transformational model&rsquo;s G 6-32[024579] 
  hexachord, play an important role in linking sections one and two. These pitches 
  are members of the {G, A, B} 3-6[024] trichord that forms the upper trichord 
  of the model in Example 5. Although 
  pitch G2 does not appear in section one, it is a common tone shared by G 6-32[024579] 
  and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] hexachord in the outer registral stream, and it is the 
  first pitch to appear in the outer stream in section two creating a long range 
  {G, A, B} 3-6[024] trichord connecting sections one and two and shedding new 
  light on the generative set class of the work. <br>
</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 14</b>. Section 3</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="scotto_examples.php?id=19&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 14 thumbnail" src="scotto_ex14_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[19] If the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix model of hexachordal progression 
  is the model or process directing hexachordal motion in the work, then the next 
  hexachord to appear in the center stream should be G 6-32[024579], the hexachord 
  from section one&rsquo;s outer stream. As the key signature change in score indicates 
  (see <b>Example 14</b>), 
  the G whole tone collection ending on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> leads directly to the G 6-32[024579] 
  hexachord. As was the case previously, the entire structural complex of relationships 
  attributed to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] and E 6-32[024579] apply to G 6-32[024579], since 
  they are T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> transformations, respectively, of each 
  other in both pitch class and pitch. As was demonstrated with the graph of Example 
  12, the arrival of G 6-32[024579] is an important event, since it marks 
  the first repetition of a hexachordal collection, it is the first time hexachords 
  have crossed in the inner streams, and it marks the halfway point in the movement 
  through (0369) cycle governing hexachordal progression. With its T<sub>6</sub> 
  related 3-6[024] trichords and its three interval-class 6s, preceding the hexachordal 
  change with the whole tone collection underscores the significance of the change.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Although the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix model of hexachordal 
  progression predicts the next hexachordal change in the center stream (the hexachordal 
  stream that determines the key signature) should be a member of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579], 
  the hexachord that arrives is B 6-32[024579] (see Example 14). The new hexachord is a member 
  of the T<sub>2</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix. Even though the expected hexachord 
  does not arrive, the interloper, as if trying to go unnoticed, continues the 
  musical processes that characterized sections one through three. The B 6-32[024579] 
  maintains the pitch realization of its T<sub>7</sub> related 3-6[024] subsets, 
  including the three semitone or ic 3 gap. The pitch classes of its T<sub>6</sub> 
  complement enter in pretty much the same fashion as in previous section. In 
  the final chord of the section, the pitch <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 fills in the ic 3 gap and stabilizes 
  the seven-note collection as B 7-35[013568t]. Finally, the inversional transformational 
  model underlying the pitch realization of both hexachordal streams in section 
  one through three is also at work here as well.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] Two non-mutually exclusive explanations can account for this departure 
  from the T<sub>1 </sub>T<sub>(0369)</sub> matrix model of the process governing 
  hexachordal progression in <i>Processional.</i> First, since the previous section 
  saw the first return of a hexachordal collection and the crossing of hexachordal 
  streams, section three was the beginning of a modified return that sufficiently 
  represented the model, so there is no need to continue along its outlined path. 
  Consequently, the music is free to develop in other directions. Second, the 
  B 6-32[024579] hexachord really could be an interloper that just temporarily 
  halts the progression of the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> hexachordal progression. 
  In the latter case a new stream begins before the active stream finishes implying 
  that both streams, T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub>, 
  will continue to influence musical developments. The latter path is the one 
  we will follow.<br>

<p>[22] Although the inversional transformational model underlies the pitch realization 
  of both hexachordal streams in section four, besides the key confirming pitch, 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, another pitch, A5, deviates from its predetermined place in register. Of 
  course, pitch-class 9 is represented by the repeated A7, the highest note in 
  the passage, but A5 does not put in an appearance (see <b>Example 15</b>). However, the contour of the 
  topmost line of the center hexachordal stream, especially the contour of the 
  section&rsquo;s last four notes certainly suggests that A5 could be this line&rsquo;s 
  goal. In fact, the A5 goal is achieved as the highest note of first chord following 
  the double bar. The new chord is a member of set class 4-20[0158]. It begins 
  the B section of the work, it holds the key to how both T<sub>(0369)</sub> progressions 
  continue, and it sets the stage for future developments.<br>
</p>


<p>[23] Before the hexachordal progression through the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> 
  matrix was interrupted by the B 6-32[024579] hexachord, the expected hexachord 
  was <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579]. Since nearly all the hexachords of the center stream are 
  expanded to the member of 7-35[013568t] implied by the key signature, the {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  D, F, A} [0158] tetrachord can easily substitute for the missing <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579]/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 
  7-35[013568t] complex by means of inclusion relationships. This chord also shares 
  a deep voice leading connection with the four previous sections. At one level 
  in fact, it is the culmination of that voice-leading pattern. As <b>Example 16</b> illustrates, placing the four inversional transformational models underlying 
  sub-sections one through four of section A side by side and in the order of 
  their appearance reveals that the highest notes of each model (beamed together 
  in the example) nearly form the {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, D, F, A} [0158] tetrachord. Simply moving 
  the B4 of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> model a half step lower, a voice leading motion that has knitted 
  sections together, transforms the beamed notes of the models into the [0158] 
  tetrachord.<br>
</p>

<p>[24] Although inclusion relations and voice leading connections make a compelling 
  case for associating the {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, D, F, A} [0158] tetrachord and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] 
  hexachord, the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 4-20[0158] tetrachord and its companions at the beginning 
  of the B section share an even more important syntactic connection with the 
  TC model underlying sections one through four that solidifies their connection. 
  The same T0369 cycle that generates an aggregate from a 3-6[024] trichord also 
  generated an aggregate from a subset of the 4-20[0158] tetrachord, the 3-4[015] 
  trichord (see <b>Example 17a</b>). Extending 
  the process to the 4-20[0158] tetrachord simply produces a repetition of one 
  of the (0369) generating cycles (see <b>Example 17b</b>). (At this point, some readers may wish to examine and compare Examples 
  32 and 34 (below), because they more 
  explicitly illustrate the transformational relationship between object and process 
  that link each of the matrices.) Although aggregates with repeated pitches are 
  often called weighted aggregates in the literature, it is not a concept that 
  applies to the present context. Once again, aggregates, in the present context, 
  are compositional spaces that are not dependent on the mapping of one pitch 
  for each pitch class. <br>
</p>
<p>[25] It should now be obvious that the other 4-20[0158] tetrachords accompanying 
  the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 4-20[0158] tetrachord at the beginning of the B section are the remaining 
  members of the T<sub>0</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> [0158] matrix. The other three 
  tetrachords all share the same relationship with a member of the T<sub>1</sub> 
  T<sub>(0369)</sub> model of hexachordal progression that the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 4-20[0158] tetrachord 
  shares with <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579]. Therefore, if each [0158] tetrachord is a substitute 
  for a hexachord in the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> model of hexachordal 
  progression, and if each tetrachord is functionally equivalent to the hexachords 
  they substitute for, then the complex of 4-20[0158] tetrachords that begins 
  the B section of the work both completes the hexachordal progression of the 
  center stream outlined in Example 12 
  and recaps it in a near retrograde.<br>

<p>[26] Example 12 demonstrated that 
  by collapsing each hexachord of the center stream to its first pitch class, 
  the cycle generating the hexachords, (147t), also represents the progression 
  of the hexachords. The same process applied to the pitch realizations of the 
  4-20[0158] tetrachords produces a reordering of the same cycle, &lt;t471&gt;, 
  which is a near retrograde of the generating cycle for the hexachords. Although 
  collapsing the pitch realizations of the 4-20[0158] tetrachords as &ldquo;major 
  seventh chords&rdquo; into their &ldquo;roots&rdquo; produces a generating cycle 
  of (147t), the cycle generating the pitch-class counterparts of 4-20[0158] tetrachords 
  in Example 17b is (0369). Consequently, 
  it always the second column of pitch-class matrices, such as the second column 
  of Example 17b, that links a pitch-class 
  complex of 4-20[0158] tetrachords to their hexachordal counterparts. Applying 
  the transformations T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> to the original 4-20[0158] 
  tetrachordal matrix generates two more matrices, which when combined with the 
  T<sub>0</sub> matrix, produce all twelve transpositions of the 4-20[0158] set 
  class. (See <b>Example 17c</b> and again, 
  the interested reader may also wish to see Example 
  34 (below), which illustrates the transformational relationships more explicitly.) 
  The hexachordal counterpart of the T<sub>1</sub> T<sub>(147t)</sub> tetrachordal 
  matrix is the T<sub>(258e)</sub> hexachordal matrix, and the hexachordal counterpart 
  of the T<sub>(258e)</sub> tetrachordal matrix is the T<sub>(0369)</sub> hexachordal matrix. 
  <br>
</p>


<p>[27] The immediate appearance of hexachords <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] and E 6-32[024579] 
  in quick succession following the 4-20[0158] tetrachordal complex solidifies 
  the relationship between the tetrachords and their hexachordal counterparts, 
  since these hexachords are the counterparts of the first two 4-2[0158] tetrachords, 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and E (see <b>Example 18</b>). The return of the hexachordal 
  material initiates a new compressed phase of hexachordal development. The pitch 
  realization of the hexachordal pair recalls the developments and structures 
  outlined in sections one through four, while the compressed time presentation 
  sets those relationships into relief. The alternation of 4-20[0158] complexes 
  with hexachordal pairs that characterizes the continuation of the &ldquo;development 
  section&rdquo; continues developing associations between the complexes, and it 
  develops the implications of the interloping B 6-32[024579] from the end of 
  the A section. As the square boxes labeled 4-20[0158] in <b>Example 19</b> illustrate, the 4-20[0158] tetrachords progress through the T<sub>0</sub>, 
  T<sub>1</sub>, and T<sub>2</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> [0158] matrices thereby 
  presenting all twelve transpositions of the set class. This progression introduces 
  another level of aggregate partitioning. Here all the transpositions of a set 
  are partitioned into groups that share an identical generative process and are 
  related to each by transposition as well.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The 6-32[024579] hexachords begin a similar progression and process in 
  between the 4-20[0158] complexes. In this section, the hyperaggregate of transformations 
  is not completed, but the implication that the interloping B 6-32[024579] hexachord&rsquo;s 
  cycle will continue at some point is fulfilled (see Example 
  19). This is the only hexachordal cycle to be completed, in fact. A nice 
  compositional detail connecting the end of the A section with the T<sub>2</sub> 
  6-32[024579] matrix is the progression through the matrix&rsquo;s hexachords. 
  The pitch realization of the final B 6-32[024579] hexachord is identical to 
  its counterpart at the end of section A (see Example 
  19). Although all the hexachords of the T<sub>2</sub> 6-32[024579] matrix 
  occur in the progression completing the cycle, the cycle is still incomplete 
  in another respect. The hexachords of the T<sub>2</sub> 6-32[024579] occupy 
  two different registral streams suggesting completion of the streams will occur 
  at a later point in the music. The next hexachord to appear in the upper stream 
  would be D 6-32[024579]. The D 6-35[02468t] whole tone hexachord that follows 
  the final incomplete 4-20[0158] complex substitutes for the outer stream D 6-32[024579]. 
  Essentially, D 6-35[02468t] functions as a transitional collection leading to 
  the section that completes the 6-32[024579] hyperaggregate.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] The process of interpolation that began at the end of section A and characterized 
  the beginning of the developmental section B continues as the 6-32[024579] hexachords 
  complete their hyperaggregate (see <b>Example 20</b>). The T<sub>1</sub> matrix 
  of 6-32[024579] hexachords, which was left incomplete in section A begins the 
  progression through the hyperaggregate (<b>Example 21</b>). It is significant that the progression begins with E 6-32[024579] and 
  moves directly to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] completing the progression in a direct way 
  that was left incomplete at the end of the A section by the interpolated B 6-32[024579] 
  hexachord. The hyperaggregate is completed by the appearance of the T<sub>0</sub> 
  and T<sub>2</sub> 6-32[024579] hexachordal matrices. The rearrangement of the 
  transformational profile of the hexachordal complexes underscores the (0369) 
  generative mechanism that underlies both the 6-32[024579] hexachordal and 4-20[0158] 
  tetrachordal complexes. In section A, the hexachords within a stream moved through 
  the ic 3 cycle while T<sub>6</sub> links the separate streams. Hexachords within 
  the right and left hand parts of each complex still move along the ic 3 cycle 
  and T<sub>6</sub> still links right and left hand streams, but the ordered succession 
  of hexachords created by the interaction of streams follows the transformational 
  path T<sub>6</sub>&mdash;T<sub>3</sub>&mdash;T<sub>6</sub> or (3906), for example. 
  Each of the 4-20[0158] tetrachordal complexes in Example 
  19 follows the same transformational path.<br>
</p>


<p>[30] The new 3-4[015] interloper that separates the first two hexachordal complexes 
  is, of course, related to the 4-20[0158] complexes by inclusion, but its new 
  association with ic 6 foreshadows the translation of an earlier generative schema 
  into the pitch dimension. After the final 6-32 hexachordal complex completes 
  the hyperaggregate, the interpolated material moves to the foreground expanding 
  the 3-4[015] trichord and the 4-8[0156] tetrachord into 6-7[012678] hexachords 
  (see <b>Example 22</b>). 
  The first 6-7[012678] hexachord in the right hand part leads to a T<sub>6</sub> 
  re-mapping of itself that is immediately followed its complement at T<sub>9</sub>. 
  The 6-7[012678] hexachords travel along the same T<sub>6</sub>&mdash;T<sub>3</sub>&mdash;T<sub>6</sub> 
  or (3906) transformational path taken by the 4-20[0158] tetrachords and 6-32[024579] 
  hexachords. The left-hand parts are also T<sub>6</sub>&mdash;T<sub>3</sub>&mdash;T<sub>6</sub> 
  or (3906) related and complements of the right hand parts. The T<sub>(0167)</sub> 
  generative schema underlying the 3-4[024] trichords of the IS model from section 
  A translated into a member of set class 4-9[0167] is, of course, included in 
  set class 6-7[012678].<br>

<p>[31] Set class 4-9[0167] emerges from the 6-7[012678] hexachordal cloud to 
  become a substantial entity in the following section where the super set generated 
  by T<sub>6</sub> related 4-20[0158] tetrachords is regenerated by means of Cohn&rsquo;s 
  concept of modes of generability. Each 4-20[0158] tetrachordal complex at the 
  opening of section B consist of two pairs of T<sub>6</sub> related 4-20[0158] 
  tetrachords forming a member of set class 8-9[01236789], a member of the TINV 
  set classes (see <b>Example 23</b>). As 
  well as generating all the transpositions of set class 4-20[0158], the tetrachordal 
  complexes generate all the transpositions of set class 8-9[01236789]. In the 
  section following the 6-7[012678] hexachords (see <b>Example 24a</b>), two different tetrachordal 
  set classes, 4-9[0167] and 4-23[0257], generate the same collection of 8-9[01236789] 
  octachords that is essentially a rotated and retrograded version of the collection 
  of 8-9[01236789] octachords in Example 
  23 (see <b>Example 24b</b>).<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Although 4-9[0167] emerges as a pitch class event in the developmental 
  B section, it is the coda that makes explicit its dual nature and its generative 
  connection to the 3-4[024] trichords and the 6-32[024579] hexachords. After 
  another round of development progressing through the T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, 
  and T<sub>2</sub> T<sub>(0369)</sub> 6-32[024579] hexachordal matrices, G 6-32[024579], 
  the T<sub>6</sub> complement of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579], leads to the return of the 
  A section (see <b>Example 25</b>). In spite of its surface differences 
  produced by the rhythmic activation of the upper trichord of the 6-32[024579] 
  hexachords, the return of the A section is structurally identical to its counterpart 
  at the syntactic level. That is, it progresses through the same four IS structures 
  in the same order as its counterpart, and the progression leads to the same 
  complex of 4-20[0158] tetrachords that marked the beginning of the development. 
  The change of function to coda is perhaps first indicated by the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> member of 
  4-20[0158] that begins the progression through the complex paired with its T<sub>6</sub> 
  partner (see <b>Example 26</b>). As was demonstrated earlier, 
  the hexachordal counterparts of each tetrachord is <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and G 6-32[024579], respectively, 
  the two hexachords that immediately follow the first 4-20[0158] complex of the 
  coda.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] The progression of 6-32[024579] hexachords in the coda corresponding to 
  the progression of hexachords in the development that completed the hyperaggregate 
  reveals the dual nature of 4-9[0167] and its generative connection to the 3-4[024] 
  trichords and the 6-32[024579] hexachords. The succession of hexachords abandons 
  the (0369) transformational path to pursue the work&rsquo;s other generative path, 
  (0167) (see <b>Example 27</b>). (The interested reader may 
  also wish to compare Example 27 with Example 
  31 (below), which illustrates how the same transformational path and the same trichordal 
  objects generate different hexachordal objects by changing the transformational 
  relationships relating hexachordal objects.) As if it is trying to bring a subconscious 
  thought into consciousness, the final reference to the 8-9[01236789] octachord 
  begins with a solo statement of 4-9[0167] (see <b>Example 28</b>). The work closes with the 
  T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> 6-32[024579] hexachordal matrices following 
  intertwined (0369) transformational paths (see <b>Examples 29a and b</b>). While the T<sub>1</sub> path 
  leads to and concludes on the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 6-32[024579] hexachord that began the work, 
  the T<sub>2</sub> path takes an unexpected but logical turn. As if trying to bring another 
  subconscious process of the work into consciousness, the final hexachord of 
  the T<sub>2</sub> path, B 6-32[024579], becomes the whole tone collection {B, 
  A, G, F, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, B}. Of course, this is the whole tone collection forming the 
  upper half of the IS model from Example 
  5b that underlies the work&rsquo;s opening. <br>
</p>
<p>[34] The appearance of 6-35[02468t] as the goal of the of the intertwined T<sub>1</sub> 
  and T<sub>2</sub> 6-32 [024579] hexachordal matrices following the (0369) transformational 
  path gives rise to another view of the work&rsquo;s final progression. Rather than 
  viewing the succession of 6-32 hexachords as following intertwined (0369) transformational 
  paths, we can also view the progression as a sequence of incomplete 7-35 septachords 
  whose collection defining pitch class is the bass note of the lower 3-6[024] 
  trichord.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> The succession of 
  bass notes, A3, G3, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3, and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3, summarizes the new transformational path that 
  relates the collections to each other and to the final 6-35 pitch-class set. 
  In this new view, each pair of incomplete septachords (A-G and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) is related 
  by T<sub>2</sub>, and each pair of T<sub>2</sub> related septachords is related 
  by T<sub>6</sub>. This transformational path connects the progression of incomplete 
  septachords to the final 6-35 collection, because three T<sub>6</sub> related pairs of 
  pitch classes related to each other by T<sub>2</sub> generates the 6-35 collection. 
  It should also be noted that the collection defining pitch classes (A, G, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) of the final progression of incomplete 7-35 septachords are a subset 
  of the final B 6-35 collection. The transformational path that concludes the 
  work sums up many of the transformational processes at work in <i>Processional.</i><br>
</p>


<p>[35] Examples 30 through 35 
  and the discussion that follows summarize, in the abstract, the transformational 
  networks governing the exchange of object and process in <i>Processional.</i> 
  Reinterpreting the pitch-class matrices as transformational networks reveals 
  that the network of tritones generating the whole-tone collection and the replication 
  of transformations from one nodal level at higher or lower levels is a feature 
  shared by all the matrices and is a source of the work&rsquo;s coherence. Each 
  of the T<sub>6</sub> nodes in a column formed by the nodes of nodes in <b>Example 30</b> generates 3-6[024] trichords whose union produces 6-35[02468t]. Applying 
  T<sub>1</sub> to Example 30 produces

<p>[36] The numerous generative transformational paths leading from subset to 
  superset is, as Cohn has noted, one of the most interesting features of the TINV 
  family of sets. It should not be surprising that the aggregate or 12-1 shares 
  this property, since it is a member of the TINV family. Translating TINV sets 
  into transformational networks that partition the aggregate, however, means 
  the TC property of 12-1 is non-trivial. The same cannot be said for a non-partitioned 
  aggregate. As well as bonding together members of TINV with sets from outside 
  the collection, TC aggregate partitioning can also be a bridge across different 
  means of generating larger sets from smaller ones. For example, the non-intersection 
  of generative components that is a hallmark of TC aggregate partitioning is 
  one of the defining features of Robert Morris&rsquo; complement union property 
  or CUP. In future work, I hope to demonstrate the general properties relating 
  TC TINV sets as a subset of generalized CUP relations. That is, we can view 
  the two methods of generating larger sets from smaller ones as concentric circles 
  with the smaller world of TINV contained within the larger CUP world with CUP 
  perhaps in a more general set of relations, such as K-nets.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] For example, in his generalization of CUP relations, Morris allows CUP 
  to expand in two directions by relaxing the constraint that the intersection 
  of the generating sets must be the null set and union of the members of the 
  generating sets classes must produce a single set class.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
  The number of set classes generated by the generalized CUP relation is indicated 
  by a superscript added to CUP. CUP<sup>4</sup>, for instance signifies that the members 
  of the generating set classes produce four different set classes when the intersection 
  of the generating sets is the null set. <i>Processional</i>&rsquo;s generative 
  3-6[024] trichord produces a CUP<sup>4</sup> relation, when the generating sets are both 
  members of set class 3-6. The four hexachords produced by this CUP relation 
  are 6-1[012345], 6-35[02468t], 6-32[024579] and 6-8[023457]. Two of the resultant 
  hexachords, 6-1 and 6-35, are members of TINV, and the generation of these hexachords 
  from the smaller TINV collection 3-6 is a function of Cohn&rsquo;s modes of generability. 
  The latter two hexachords, 6-32 and 6-8, are not members of TINV, however, but 
  the similar generative path from smaller to larger set demonstrates how the 
  smaller collection of TINV sets connects to the larger world of sets that are 
  not members of TINV. It also demonstrates another reason why, in the specific 
  case at hand, the diatonic makes a good playmate for TINV sets. The CUP<sup>4</sup> relation 
  also demonstrates how the 7-23[0234579] from the work&rsquo;s opening fits into the 
  larger framework of the piece, since the CUP4 hexachord 6-8[023457] is a subset 
  of the 7-23 hexachord. As was stated earlier, the 6-33[023579] hexachord from 
  the work&rsquo;s opening is also a subset of 7-23, and the mutual inclusion of 
  6-8, 6-33, and 6-32 in 7-23 creates an indirect role for 6-8 as a unifying force 
  in <i>Processional. </i>K-nets, however, reveal that 6-33 hexachord is one path 
  through which the 3-6[024] trichord creates connections with other trichords.<br>

<p>[38] The pitch-class exchange of B2 for <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 in Example 
  6 produced a member of the hexachordal set class, 6-33 [023579]. As was 
  the case with the opening 6-32[024579] hexachord, the pitch realization of the 
  hexachord is as two trichords. In the treble clef, the pitch classes {<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  F} are a member of 3-6[024], and the pitch classes in the bass clef(s) {B, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>} are a member of set class 3-2 [013]. However, unlike the 6-32[024579], the 
  two trichords forming 6-33[024579] are members of different set classes. The 
  T<sub>(0369)</sub> transformational path through its aggregate generating power 
  created a powerful bond between members of different set classes, such as the 
  3-6[024] and 3-4[015] trichords. Unfortunately, neither the T<sub>(0369)</sub> 
  nor the T<sub>(0167)</sub> transformational paths can similarly unite members 
  of set classes 3-6[024] and 3-2[013]. Although the trichords do not forge a 
  connection under the work&rsquo;s more prominent transformational networks, they 
  are members of a k-net that does have a significant link with the T<sub>2</sub> 
  relationship that figures so prominently in <i>Processional.</i> <b>Example 36</b> demonstrates that the k-nets for each trichord are isographic. Specifically, 
  they are a positive isography under the group automorphism &lt;1,1&gt;.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
  The positive isography is the result of dyad-class 2&rsquo;s inclusion in each 
  trichord. Of course, the transformational interpretation of the dyad becomes 
  the operation T<sub>2</sub>. These network interpretations of the pitch-class 
  sets demonstrate that the T<sub>2</sub> relationship that generates the 3-6[024] 
  trichord and so many other sets in the composition can also cast a wider net 
  over many of the work&rsquo;s more local events and relate them to the underlying 
  processes governing the global procession. Of course, the other prominent transpositional 
  relationships generating transformation structures in <i>Processional</i> will 
  produce similar k-nets relating structures that contain dyads other than ic 
  2.<br>
</p>
<p>[39] Expanding the analytical field of view to include the interconnection 
  of object and process often reveals the camouflaged bridges connecting concentric 
  circles. In this new worldview, compositional design would determine the utility 
  of a circle&rsquo;s structural properties, and it would determine movement between 
  circles. Since there are bridges connecting circles, the circles themselves 
  do not have to become equivalence classes. I hope my analysis <i>Processional</i> 
  has demonstrated the importance of considering both objects and their interconnection 
  with process in <i>Processional</i> and perhaps in Crumb&rsquo;s work as a whole. 
  The interconnection reveals his compositional procedures extend beyond the boundaries 
  of any particular circle, such as exclusive use of symmetrical set classes. 
  The study of object and process in a Crumb work also reveals that aggregate-based 
  atonal methods and composing with symmetrical referential collections are concepts 
  that can peacefully coexist and reinforce each other. In the spirit of Hegel, 
  <i>Processional</i> is a synthesis of compositional procedures that often assume 
  the roles of thesis and antithesis in the dialectic. Of course, the same observations 
  hold with regard to the superset levels within the TINV family, so a well-partitioned 
  aggregate is just as good a referential collection as any of the other supersets 
  in the TINV family. That is, the properties that endow the whole tone and octatonic 
  collections with special status within the TINV family are properties also possessed 
  by a well-partitioned aggregate. Finally, I hope that I have shown the structural 
  gap generating equivalence classes of composers may not be as large as it once 
  appeared to be. Perhaps now it is just a similarity relation.</p>
