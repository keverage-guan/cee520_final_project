<p style="text-align: center"><b>I</b></p>

<p>[1] Rubato is widely regarded as a purely intuitive art. While it may be true 
that most performers rely solely on intuition for their rubato, a conscious 
approach may also be helpful. For the teacher of &ldquo;analysis for performers,&rdquo; a 
conscious approach is essential if rubato is to be discussed at all.</p>
<p>

[2] Rubato is a difficult subject to theorize. The late David Epstein made an 
admirable attempt in his book <i>Shaping Time,</i> using recordings by 
performers he admired to construct quantitative models.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
My approach here will be qualitative rather than quantitative, and introspective 
rather than empirical. Unlike Epstein, I will make no attempt to construct a 
general theory. Musicians in different times and places&mdash;even composers of the 
same generation, such as Chopin and Liszt&mdash;had distinctly different conceptions 
of rubato.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> One is probably justified, therefore, in approaching the idea of a 
general theory with caution.</p>
<p>

[3]
A few nineteenth-century writers did try to develop something like a general 
theory of rubato. Carl Czerny&rsquo;s <i>Von dem Vortrage</i> was published in 1839, the same 
year as Chopin&rsquo;s Preludes, op. 28.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> A relatively modest treatise, it deals mostly 
with the style of the generation preceding Chopin&rsquo;s. Mathis Lussy&rsquo;s ambitious 
<i>Treatise on Musical Expression</i> dates from 1874, a quarter-century after Chopin&rsquo;s 
death, but it describes a style that Lussy absorbed in the opera houses and 
concert rooms of Paris, from some of the same artists whom Chopin would have 
heard when they were young. When Lussy applies the same rules of rubato to <i>Don 
Giovanni</i> that he does to the operas of Donizetti and Meyerbeer, he reveals 
something about how Mozart&rsquo;s music was performed in the third quarter of the 
nineteenth century; but he also alerts us, unintentionally, to the dangers of 
over-generalizing about rubato.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[4]
I will avoid these dangers by focusing on one piece, Chopin&rsquo;s Prelude in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 
Major from op. 28. This is a piece that I played, at my piano teacher&rsquo;s 
direction, when I was seventeen. I was going through an anti-Romantic phase at 
the time, so I didn&rsquo;t like the piece very much; but I knew that it was by Chopin 
and, therefore, I needed to apply rubato. I did this in an unusually conscious 
way, based on what I now recognize as aspects of grouping, meter, and tonal 
structure. I deliberately counted each acceleration and retardation that I made, 
trying to maintain what I felt to be a proper rate of tempo change. (Here is 
where my intuitions may have come close to Epstein&rsquo;s.) I now love the piece, and 
I think I hear it more deeply, but I also believe that my youthful thoughts on 
rubato were largely correct, in the sense that they highlighted real aspects of 
the music and contributed to what my piano teacher, at least, regarded as an 
effective performance. In discussing my more-than-thirty-year-old thoughts, I 
will use a vocabulary that was unknown to me when I was seventeen. I will 
discuss rubato on small, medium, and large scales. At the end, I will briefly 
discuss two other Chopin preludes by way of comparison.</p>

<p>[5]
The form of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-major Prelude is simple. It is a five-part rondo, ABACA, 
framed by a two-measure introduction and a slightly longer coda. The second A 
section is incomplete, consisting of an antecedent phrase without its 
consequent; the third and final A section is heard over a tonic pedal. The form 
of the piece is diagrammed in my <b>Example 1</b>.</p>
<p>

[6]
A special feature of this Prelude is that the rhythm that governs its 
accompaniment also shapes its melody. This rhythm I will call the <i>Ur</i>-rhythm of 
the piece. In its simplest form, shown in <b>Example 2</b>a, the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm consists of 
an upbeat, or anacrusis, consisting of five eighth notes, starting just after 
the downbeat of one measure and leading to the downbeat of the next. There are 
six attacks; the final note is of variable duration.</p>
<p>

[7]
The <i>Ur-</i>rhythm is an example of the end-accented or <i>abbetonte</i> motive described by 
Hugo Riemann in his book <i>Musikalische Dynamik und Agogik</i>.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> According to Riemann, 
the end-accented motive is naturally associated with <i>crescendo</i> and a slight 
<i>accelerando.</i> <i>Crescendo</i> expresses the motive&rsquo;s dynamic quality, <i>accelerando</i> what 
Riemann calls its agogic aspect.</p>
<p>

[8]
In two books by Schenker, <i>Free Composition</i> and <i>The Art of Performance,</i> 
repeated-note motives are discussed in a similar way.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> As shown in 
<b>Example 3</b>, 
Schenker&rsquo;s repeated-note motives drive toward the downbeat; his 
rightward-pointing arrows are meant to indicate acceleration. Schenker was 
referring chiefly to repeated-note motives, but it is interesting that he 
segments these motives exactly as Riemann would have done, making them 
end-accented and, in long measures, subdividing them. We may conclude that there 
existed a tradition, at least in the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, whereby motives that begin with a long upbeat were felt to accelerate 
to their respective downbeats. This conclusion, as it happens, accords perfectly 
with my intuitions about Chopin&rsquo;s Prelude. In my performance of the piece, the 
accelerating <i>Ur-</i>rhythm controls rubato on the smallest scale.</p>
<p>

[9]
The <i>Ur-</i>rhythm has two important variants, shown in Examples 
2b and 2c. That in 
Example 
2b occurs only in the accompaniment, especially in the accompanying 
voices of the right hand. Here, following the five-note upbeat, the downbeat 
note is withheld, regardless of whether a rest is notated there. I will call 
this the <i>incomplete form</i> of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm. The incomplete form is especially 
effective when (as often happens) the repeated chords contain a leading tone, a 
dissonance, or both; resolution is delayed by at least an eighth note, impelling 
motion forward while adding tension. For example, the right hand&rsquo;s eighth notes 
in measure 12 are tendency tones: C is a leading tone, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> the seventh of the 
chord. Resolution is delayed until the second eighth note of measure 13, where both 
tones resolve in the left hand. The player can physically <i>feel</i> the withheld 
resolution because the right hand does nothing while the left hand must travel 
downward to reach the new bass note, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. In this piece, Chopin tends to 
assign active tones, both consonant and dissonant, to the right hand, as he does 
at the very beginning of the piece, although this often means that the two hands 
are physically intertwined.</p>
<p>

[10] Example 2c shows a variant of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm that is peculiar to the melody. Here 
the downbeat note, a dotted quarter, is followed by another note of similar 
value; the final note acts as an afterbeat and ends the two-measure group.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> This 
variant contains seven attacks, with the strongest accent falling on the 
penultimate note. Compared to the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s basic form (example 2a), this new 
form is, as Riemann would have called it, &ldquo;over-complete&rdquo; (<i>&uuml;berkomplet</i>). 
Borrowing Riemann&rsquo;s terminology, Examples 2a through 2c might be termed, 
respectively, the <i>complete, incomplete,</i> and <i>over-complete</i> forms of the 
<i>Ur-</i>rhythm.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[11]
A different way of classifying the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s forms is by analogy with Italian 
opera, which Chopin is known to have loved. By Italian standards, Example 2c, 
not 2a, represents the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s basic form, because it features what Italians 
call a <i>piano</i> ending (<i>piano</i> in this context means &ldquo;plain&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;soft&rdquo;). In 
Italian poetry, a line normally ends with a strongly accented syllable followed 
by a single weak syllable&mdash;a <i>parola piana</i> (&ldquo;plain word&rdquo;), of which the word 
<i>piano</i> 
itself is an example. The ending in Example 2a, by contrast, corresponds to the
<i>tronco</i> (&ldquo;truncated&rdquo;) line-ending in Italian. (Notice that in Italian the 
&ldquo;feminine&rdquo; ending is the norm, the &ldquo;masculine&rdquo; a deviation.) In the Italian 
libretti of Chopin&rsquo;s time, <i>tronco</i> endings are typically used to mark the ends of 
stanzas. Example 2b, finally, does not form a satisfactory line; it lacks the 
required <i>accento commune</i> (&ldquo;common accent&rdquo;) and is therefore seriously 
incomplete.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>

[12]
That the Italianate view is illuminating is suggested by 
<b>Example 
4</b>. Here the 
Prelude&rsquo;s A section, a parallel period of sixteen measures, is arranged as a 
double quatrain of verse, as if this were an aria.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> The &ldquo;verse meter&rdquo; of Chopin&rsquo;s 
melody corresponds approximately, but only approximately, to <i>settenario,</i> the 
seven-syllable meter of Italian poetry.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> In each quatrain, three <i>piano</i> endings 
are followed by a <i>tronco</i> ending. Chopin&rsquo;s melodic &ldquo;stanzas&rdquo; are thus quite 
regularly formed.</p>
<p>

[13]
In the remainder of this essay I will follow the Riemannian classification 
outlined earlier, largely because it expresses my earlier view of the Prelude&rsquo;s 
rhythmic and motivic structure. I recommend, however, that the Italianate view 
be considered by readers when they analyze music by Italian composers, or by 
non-Italians who were strongly influenced by Italy: Handel, J. S. and J. C. 
Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Chopin, to name only a few.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[14]

If one follows Chopin&rsquo;s changes of harmony, or even his pedal markings, one 
would conclude that the left hand begins a new group with each downbeat. I do 
not hear the left hand in this way; for the most part, I group the left hand 
according to the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm. In Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s terms, my grouping is 
out of phase with the meter. My grouping of the accompaniment is certainly 
influenced by the melody, but it is also a matter of physical gesture: only a 
beginning pianist, I think, would take appreciable time after the last chord in 
a measure to find the next bass note; in most measures, the bass note <i>ends</i> the 
physical impulse rather than beginning it. This pattern changes in (for example) 
measures 6 and 8, where the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm is absent; here the bass note begins each 
group. The same applies throughout most of the final A section, where the 
two-measure subphrases sound as long afterbeats to the recurring tonic pedal.</p>
<p>

[15]
To repeat, we have three forms of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm: the complete form, the 
incomplete form, and the over-complete form. These three forms are deployed 
contrapuntally throughout much of the Prelude. In measure 12, for instance, we see 
the over-complete form ending in the melody while the remaining voices of the 
right hand sound the incomplete form; the left hand is grouped according to the 
complete form. All three forms accelerate to the downbeat; the over-complete 
form relaxes, both dynamically and agogically, into its afterbeat.</p>
<p>

[16]
When I first played this Prelude I don&rsquo;t think I had ever heard it played, and I 
knew nothing of Riemann or Schenker, but I played the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm much as I 
imagine they would have done. This may have something to do with the way in 
which I experience musical meter. For most of my life I have both felt and 
visualized meter through the image of a bouncing ball. For me, motion to a 
downbeat is quite literally <i>downward</i> motion, and a downbeat is something you 
bounce off of. To put the matter another way: Where a rhythm is heard as anacrustic, moving 
<i>from</i> upbeat <i>to</i> downbeat, the downbeat exerts a kind of 
gravitational force, attracting notes of the upbeat to it. Since human beings 
experience gravity as a downward pull, Chopin&rsquo;s <i>Ur-</i>rhythm is readily felt as a 
downward fall or slide to the bottom of something. Downward slides are not 
constant in speed; they accelerate. And since any physical medium contains some 
friction, the rate of acceleration will not be constant, either; it will 
increase until the effect of friction is largely overcome. Hence the image in my 
title. Rubato in this prelude is as easy, and as natural, as falling off a log.</p>

[17] <b>Example 5</b> offers a score of the entire Prelude, with annotations in measures 1&ndash;36 to 
show <i>accelerando</i> (symbolized by rightward arrows) and <i>ritardando</i> (symbolized by 
leftward arrows). A simple illustration of falling-off-a-log may be found in measures 
34&ndash;35, the juncture between the B section and the second A. Here a <i>crescendo</i> is 
indicated by Chopin, and an <i>accelerando</i> to the downbeat faces no physical (i.e., pianistic) impediments such as large leaps. A feeling of falling to the bottom 
is physically reproduced in the motion of the left hand, which tumbles to what 
we think of as the bottom of the keyboard.</p>
<p>

[18]
The <i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s over-complete form features the same gravitational pull toward 
the downbeat, but it adds a gliding motion at the end. This rhythm is associated 
with several motive-forms; two of these are shown in 
<b>Example 
6</b>. Motive-form 1 is 
a seven-note idea, subdivided 3 + 4 by a descending leap in the middle; it 
articulates a pair of ascending thirds (bracketed in the example), of which the 
second is embellished with a long appoggiatura. The motive&rsquo;s subdivision implies 
a corresponding subdivision of the <i>accelerando.</i> I would first accelerate and 
<i>crescendo</i> to the third note, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, which falls on the second-strongest point 
in the measure; then I would pull back slightly to accelerate and <i>crescendo</i> 
anew, climaxing on the appoggiatura. The appoggiatura&rsquo;s resolution is properly 
expressed by a <i>diminuendo</i> in the melody; the corresponding deceleration is 
accommodated by the accompaniment, which begins a new, accelerating statement of 
the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm in measure 12.</p>
<p>

[19]
Motive-form 2 places a shorter appoggiatura on the third note and descends from 
there to the downbeat; the afterbeat ascends one step. The placement of the 
appoggiatura suggests a 4 + 3 subdivision, but the listener is unlikely to hear 
it because there is no change of contour between notes 3 and 6, and because all 
melodic intervals are small.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Once the motive goes &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; with note 3, it 
tends to accelerate to the downbeat. I like to stress the appoggiatura function 
of note 3 by playing that note a little extra-quickly in some passages. This 
helps to clarify matters in measure 7, for example, where I hear G5, a tenth, as an 
appoggiatura to F5, a ninth.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>

[20]
There are exceptions to the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s control of small-scale rubato. If we 
resume our metaphor of something sliding or falling in response to gravity, 
exceptions may be said to occur where there is some extra friction present&mdash;a 
protruding bit of bark on the log, so to speak, that slows our fall. 
<b>Example 
7</b> shows two instances of such friction. Example 7a, the beginning of the B 
section, is based on another variant of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm. The second melodic 
statement, measures 21&ndash;22, contrasts with the first in that one of the steps is an 
augmented second, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;A; this A forms a minor ninth with the bass, an interval 
that we hear for the first time in this Prelude.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Chopin writes an accent mark 
over the A, expressing the suddenly frictive melodic and harmonic situation. I 
treat this as more an agogic than a dynamic accent; the extra time taken for the 
A may be given back by playing the ascending sixth <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;E a little more quickly.</p>
<p>

[21]
Example 7b shows no notational signs of friction. This is, however, one of 
several instances in which there is a change of chord, or a new note is added to 
a chord, during the accelerating phase of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm. The F in the alto voice 
at the end of measure 9 might be described as an added sixth in a Rameauvian 
imperfect cadence to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major; in terms of voice leading, F might be 
understood as a passing tone originating in the left hand&rsquo;s <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and forming 
another statement of the motivic ascending third: <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;F&ndash;G, imitating the 
melody&rsquo;s <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;C.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> The added sixth, being dissonant, represents musical 
friction; the concealed motive-statement&mdash;if one hears it and wishes others to 
hear it&mdash;requires a little time to sound. These considerations suggest that the 
final eighth note of measure 9 be slightly lengthened.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>IV</b></p>
<p>

[22]
Rising and falling sequences occur in the B and C sections, where they affect 
rubato on what might be termed the medium scale. Chopin marks the rising 
sequences with <i>crescendos,</i> the falling ones with <i>diminuendos.</i> I will discuss 
descending sequences first; these begin at measures 24 and 51. Here, in my own 
playing, I disregard the conventional correlation between <i>diminuendo</i> and 
<i>ritardando;</i> I accelerate during each descending sequence, because these seem to 
me like extended instances of falling-off-a-log. Having climbed to a peak in the 
preceding ascent, the music tumbles downward, accelerating as it goes.</p>
<p>

[23]
I accelerate in the ascending sequences as well, but, as Lussy would have 
advised, I treat the final approach to the climax as effortful, hence slower<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup>&mdash;or, as I prefer to think of it, &ldquo;thicker.&rdquo; In the experience of musical 
friction, time itself seems to thicken, whereas the act of falling and 
accelerating makes time seem thin. To express these sensations I am forced to 
change from a solid to a liquid metaphor. With apologies to Frank Samarotto&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;temporal plasticity,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> I will term the phenomenon 
<i>temporal viscosity.</i><p>[24] A viscous medium offers more resistance to a falling body than a non-viscous 
one. When viscosity, or friction, is minimized, acceleration in response to 
Earth&rsquo;s gravity approaches the theoretical ideal of 32 feet per second per 
second. I&rsquo;m not sure what the musical equivalent of that constant is, but it&rsquo;s 
important to note that Chopin&rsquo;s descending sequences move through a surprisingly 
viscous medium. That is because, while his ascending sequences move 
quasi-diatonically, his descending sequences are chromatic. A sequence through 
any contextually normative pitch space (to use Fred Lerdahl&rsquo;s term<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup>) is 
relatively friction-free, offering little resistance to the flow of time. But an 
abrupt change of space is frictive, it seems to me, if either of the following 
conditions obtains: (1) if the new space consists of more tones per octave than 
the normative space, so that it seems more complex;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> or (2) if the new space is 
more differentiated internally, meaning that one has moved from an 
equal-interval space to one in which adjacencies are spaced unequally. The 
situation in the Prelude, where the normative space is diatonic, is mixed in 
this regard.</p>
<p>[25]
The sequence that begins the B section ascends in diatonic thirds, tonicizing A 
major, then <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> minor, then E major. A descending sequence follows, moving 
chromatically from I to V of E major; from one measure to the next, the sequence 
descends in whole tones. Extra friction is provided by German augmented sixth 
chords resolving, in eighth notes, to altered dominant sevenths (or, if you 
prefer, French sixths). The heightened chromaticism and dissonance, along with 
the faster harmonic rhythm, offer resistance to the uniform acceleration that 
might be appropriate to a simpler or more diatonic sequence, especially one 
without submetrical changes of harmony. On the other hand, the 
chromatic/whole-tone descent is undifferentiated internally until the sequence 
is broken. (A change in the melodic sequence emphasizes V of E major in measure 26.) 
We are told by the composer Ignaz Moscheles that Chopin played his remote 
modulations &ldquo;with elfin lightness.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> That is worth keeping in mind here, but it 
seems to me that the frequent chord changes require a little more time than 
repeated chords would have done.</p>
<p>[26]
In section C, the descending sequence beginning at measure 51 is again more chromatic 
than the ascending sequence that precedes it. This time the sequence descends 
chromatically at the full-measure level, and there are no submetrical harmonic 
changes to slow the acceleration. The pattern changes, of course, with the 
expanding chromatic wedge in measure 54, where I give time to the augmented sixth 
chords at the beginning and end of the measure. Taking time at the end of measure 54 
also follows the principle of &ldquo;thickening&rdquo; as one approaches a climax&mdash;in this 
case, the <i>forte</i> cadence in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>V</b></p>
<p>[27]
Sections B and C each begin with a common-tone modulation. In each case the new 
chord is a secondary dominant, and the common tone changes its status from root 
to leading tone. One might invoke Schenker&rsquo;s concept of the 5&ndash;6 shift, 
especially at measure 43. Metrically, there is at least a suggestion that the last 
measure of the respective A section is strong and the first measure of the new 
section is weak. The new sections also share similar melodic rhythms.</p>
<p>[28]
Nowadays I emphasize these parallelisms in playing the two passages. I try to 
make the new beginning grow out of the previous ending, &ldquo;breathing&rdquo; not before 
but just after the new section&rsquo;s first note. This is meant to emphasize the 5&ndash;6 
shift, with its implication of strong-to-weak. It also follows the principle 
that when a pitch is repeated in long-short rhythm, the long note tends to end a 
group at some level.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>
<p>[29]
In measures 17&ndash;19, the melody&rsquo;s <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is heard four times in succession, each time 
with a different tonal or metric function. I take extra time here so that the 
changes can be savored. A further anomaly at this juncture is that, to my ear, 
the repeated chords in measure 18 act for once as afterbeat, or end, rather than as 
upbeat. For this reason, too, I continue and even augment my cadential ritard 
into the first beat of measure 19&mdash;making this, in my performance, one of the slowest 
moments in the Prelude.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup></p>
<p>[30]
If this is where the tempo reaches one of its slowest points, where is it 
fastest? We know that performers in the early twentieth century felt freer to 
accelerate above a basic tempo than performers after World War II, when 
&ldquo;rushing&rdquo; came to be considered the worst possible sin.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> In this Prelude I rush 
happily, deliberately, and in good conscience. I rush mostly in passages of 
tonal stasis, such as the two-measure introduction, where I add an 
<i>accelerando-ritardando</i> to Chopin&rsquo;s <i>crescendo-diminuendo.</i> I rush most of all 
during the twin pedal points on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&mdash;the first at the end of the 
B section, the other at the end of section C. These two pedal points, which 
function as codettas, feature the same music, and they suggest a large-scale 
upper-neighbor motion from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>VI (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major) to V (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>). Playing both at 
accelerated tempos is one way of associating the two passages, which are 
separated by more than twenty measures of music. Over each pedal, harmonic and 
melodic motion is minimal; short-range goals have been reached, and the music 
celebrates their achievement. In the large-scale rubato of the Prelude, these 
for me are the twin peaks. Lacking significant pitch motion, the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm 
becomes the focus of attention. If we compare the two passages, we find an 
interesting difference: the pedal on E sounds a little less celebratory because 
Chopin uses the frustrated, incomplete form of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm in the 
accompaniment; over the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> pedal he uses the complete form. The use of the 
<i>Ur-</i>rhythm&rsquo;s complete form also creates a duet with the melody that didn&rsquo;t exist 
in the earlier passage.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>VI</b></p>
<p>[31] There are two other preludes from op. 28 in which the accompaniment is based on 
a six-note, end-accented motive in eighth notes. These are Preludes No. 13 in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
Major and No. 21 in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> Major. In these preludes, unlike No. 17, the 
<i>Ur-</i>rhythm is mostly (No. 21) or entirely (No. 13) confined to the accompaniment.</p>
<p>[32]
For rubato, the fact that these preludes feature melodies in long notes is 
significant. In each case the melody moves in values as large as dotted halves. 
Thus a single melody note may correspond to one complete statement of the 
<i>Ur-</i>rhythm in the left hand. The music moves at two different speeds: the 
accompaniment repeats its pattern every three quarter notes, while the melody 
moves in cycles of at least four dotted halves. Rubato in these melodies is 
ruled by patterns of tension and release within the larger cycles, not the 
smaller ones.</p>

<p>[33]
Let us begin with Prelude No. 21; measures 1&ndash;8 are given in 
<b>Example 8</b>. The melody has 
local climaxes in measures 3 and 7, the third bar of each hypermeasure; both climaxes 
feature long notes that might loosely be termed appoggiaturas.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> The pianist would 
naturally &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; to these notes, meaning that they would be the goal of a 
slight <i>crescendo</i> and, simultaneously, the beginning of a slight <i>
diminuendo.</i><sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> These dynamic swells might be accompanied by a very slight 
<i>accelerando-ritardando,</i> which in this texture need not be coordinated precisely 
with the left hand.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup></p>
<p>[34]
Chopin&rsquo;s slurs make the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm explicit in the accompaniment. Two kinds of 
measures alternate in the left hand of measures 1&ndash;4: measures in which motion to the 
downbeat is smooth and stepwise, encouraging a smooth acceleration to accompany 
the indicated <i>crescendo;</i> and measures in which the contour is more varied. Later 
in the piece, the distinction between the two kinds of measures is sometimes 
blurred.</p>
<p>[35]
It is useful to think of the accompaniment as a three-voice texture: two tenor 
voices are in dialogue over a slowly moving bass. The &ldquo;first tenor&rdquo; is 
especially interesting; it is mostly based on the incomplete form of the 
<i>Ur-</i>rhythm. That is, the first tenor&rsquo;s last eighth note in a measure usually 
resolves to, or in some other sense is felt to move toward, the second eighth 
note in the measure following. The result is a feeling of frustrated resolution 
on the downbeat itself. The exception is measure 2, where the first tenor&rsquo;s motion 
ends with <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 on the third beat; at the same time, the second tenor has 
completed its characteristic chromatic descent with D3. This third-beat ending 
throws into relief the connective leap across the bar line, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>2&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>2. The 
six-note <i>Ur-</i>rhythm thus subdivides into 4 + 2. This subdivision suggests that 
acceleration to the downbeat of measure 3 might be similarly articulated. </p>
<p>[36]
As in the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> Prelude, there are passages of harmonic stasis; see the 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-major passage beginning at measure 17 (not shown). In both preludes I would 
play these static passages at a slightly faster tempo. In the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-major 
passage, the left hand follows a hemiola pattern that fits under the hand far 
more comfortably than the polyphonic accompaniment of the prelude&rsquo;s opening 
measures. As is often the case with Chopin, for whom the tactile quality of 
piano playing was enormously important, the physical ease of measures 17ff. is 
connected with what I take to be the implication of increased speed.</p>

Prelude No. 13 (<b>Example 9</b>) has much in common with No. 21, above all in its 
texture and hypermeter. (Each hypermeasure contains four dotted-half-note 
beats.) Here the melody begins by climaxing on the fourth, rather than the 
third, beat of each hypermeasure. Since the melody begins with repeated notes, 
we would probably accelerate through these, following Schenker&rsquo;s dictum, even 
though B4 does not fall on a downbeat. In Riemann&rsquo;s terms, we would phrase to 
B4, accelerating slightly and adding an unwritten <i>crescendo.</i> Upon reaching B4 we 
would both decelerate and <i>diminuendo.</i></p>
<p>[38]
The left-hand accompaniment is more varied in contour than in either of the 
other preludes. Its internal grouping is not immediately obvious, but I believe 
it is best interpreted as shown in  
<b>Example 
10</b>. After <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2&mdash;the bass note for all 
of measure 1&mdash;is sounded on the downbeat, a group of four &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; notes, 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, is followed by a two-note group, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2, bridging with an 
arpeggio the large distance between tenor and bass. In other words, the grouping 
closely resembles that of measure 2 in Prelude No. 21. A dissonant leap, initially 
the major seventh <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, separates each bass note from the following tenor 
group. The latter subdivides in two different ways simultaneously: as two 
ascending thirds (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>), and as an incomplete double-neighbor figure 
(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>) plus a singleton (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>).<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> The former grouping is obvious, but the latter 
corresponds better to the voice-leading. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> is an appoggiatura to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, so I make 
it the dynamic high point of the four-note group. This dynamic shape stands in 
contrast to that of the repeated-note accompaniment in Prelude No. 17, where the 
downbeat represents both the dynamic and the agogic high point of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm.
</p>


<p>[39]
For me, the left hand in the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-major Prelude evokes the sound of a solo cello. 
If the Prelude were transposed to G major, the four-note group might or might 
not be played on a single string,<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> but the two-note group would inevitably 
involve string crossings (i.e., the open D and G strings; A3, the dynamic high 
point, might also be played on an open string). We might compare the opening of 
Bach&rsquo;s G-major Cello Suite, BWV 1007 (<b>Example 
11</b>a), which similarly features a 
division into bass and tenor registers with arpeggios connecting them. Here the 
leaps are all consonant until measure 3, but Victor Zuckerkandl, at least, advised 
that the cellist make all groups end-accented.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> Among other advantages, 
end-accented groups encompass the resolutions of the lower neighboring notes (A3 
in measure 1, B3 in measure 2, etc.).</p>
<p>[40]
Comparison might also be made to the main theme of Chopin&rsquo;s Barcarolle, op. 60, 
another piece in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> major (Example 11b), and to Prelude No. 3 in G Major 
(Example 11c). In the Barcarolle, the enormous leap across the bar line helps to 
clarify that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2 begins a group at the measure level. One might, however, hear 
an end-accented group culminating on the second <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2 in each measure, with a 
grouping overlap on that note. The two equal leaps upward from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2 help one to 
hear the grouping as <i>anbetont</i>&mdash;i.e., beginning with the strongest beat in the 
group. Although the sum of the two leaps is a ninth, each leap in itself is 
consonant&mdash;a perfect fifth. (There is a suggestion of hemiola in this example, 
but we will not pursue it here.)</p>
<p>[41]
The story of the G-major Prelude is similar. The consonant arpeggio ascending 
from G2 tends to bind the bass note to the &ldquo;tenor&rdquo; B3 and to the notes in 
between. The most ambiguous note in this pattern, from a grouping standpoint, is 
the final sixteenth note in each measure. Registral proximity suggests grouping 
this D3 with the following G2, and the occasional sixteenth note in the melody 
strengthens the suggestion. But some later versions of the left-hand pattern&mdash;in 
measures 6&ndash;8, for example&mdash;distort the leap across the bar line to the extent that one 
might well treat the bar line as a grouping boundary, though only in the left 
hand.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p>
<p>[42]
Neither in Prelude No. 13 nor in the patterns of Example 11 would a seamless 
<i>accelerando</i> to the strong beat be appropriate. Each pattern requires its own 
dynamic and agogic shaping, but none represents the simple sliding into the 
downbeat&mdash;the falling-off-a-log&mdash;that one hears in Prelude No. 17 and at the 
beginning of Prelude No. 21. Patterns of pitch contour, implied polyphony, and 
voice leading affect (or should affect) the performance of the <i>Ur-</i>rhythm 
uniquely in every case.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>VII</b></p>
<p>[43]
I return, at last, to my opening thoughts. Can principles of rubato be 
generalized? To some degree yes, but only within a given style, and we should 
take care not to define that style too broadly. Even within these limits, 
principles of rubato will have, at best, the status of Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
preference rules, which often come into conflict in such a way that their 
resolution&mdash;the decision as to which rule governs a certain situation&mdash;is a matter 
of judgment.</p>
<p>[44]
Some principles can be generalized further than others. For example, the idea of 
accelerating through an anacrustic motive is probably valid for much 
nineteenth-century music, especially solo and chamber music, so long as the 
motive contains little of what I have termed musical friction. The notion of 
friction itself, and the performative responses to friction that I have proposed 
here, are probably capable of broader generalization. What may be less 
generalizable is, for example, the extreme sensitivity to tactile aspects of 
playing that is characteristic of Chopin&rsquo;s piano music but not, say, of 
Beethoven&rsquo;s.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup></p>
<p>[45]
Finally, I wish to remind the reader that many of the conclusions I have 
advanced in this essay have been expressed, often more eloquently, by authors 
who experienced the nineteenth century at first hand: Czerny, Lussy, Riemann, 
and Schenker, among others. Although recorded performances have undeniable value 
as models of rubato playing, further research into rubato should also take note 
of what performers and teachers have said on the subject&mdash;especially those 
performers and teachers who participated more or less contemporaneously in the 
tradition they have sought to describe.</p>

Novello and Ewer, 1892). Lussy&rsquo;s prescriptions for the performance of excerpts 
by Mozart are, in general, the least convincing in the book.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">Riemann, <i>Musikalische Dynamik und Agogik. Lehrbuch 
der musikalischen Phrasirung auf Grund einer Revision der Lehre von der

Esser, trans. Irene Schreier Scott (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), is 
a compilation of previously unpublished material by Schenker, most of it written 
in the early 1910s.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Lerdahl and Jackendoff define an afterbeat as a weak 
beat that groups with the preceding strong beat, not with the following strong 
beat. See <i>A Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: The MIT 
Press, 1983), 28.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">See Riemann 1884, 29&ndash;30, 98, and 174&ndash;76.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">An excellent source on Italian prosody and its relation 
to operatic music is Robert Moreen, &ldquo;Integration of Text Forms and Musical Forms 
in Verdi&rsquo;s Early Operas&rdquo; (Ph.D. dissertation, Princeton University, 1975).</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">I have presented a similar versification of a Chopin 
melody in &ldquo;Ambiguity in the Themes of Chopin&rsquo;s First, Second, and Fourth 
Ballades&rdquo; (<i>Int&eacute;gral</i> 8 [1995]: 1&ndash;50). The melody there is the main theme 
of the First Ballade, op. 23.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">The relation to <i>settenario</i> is imperfect because only 
Chopin&rsquo;s primary accent corresponds to the poetic meter; his secondary accent 
does not. In <i>settenario,</i> the secondary accent normally falls on the fourth 
syllable.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">For an illuminating example, see Reinhard Strohm, &ldquo;Merkmale 
italienischer Versvertonung in Mozarts Klavierkonzerten,&rdquo; <i>Analecta 
musicologica</i> 18 (1978): 219&ndash;36.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">In his book <i>Musikalische Rhythmik und Metrik</i> 
(Magdeburg, 1917), Theodor Wiehmayer disputes the idea that an appoggiatura or 
suspension must group with its resolution. Some of his examples (50) are 
convincing; see especially those from Bach&rsquo;s F-minor Prelude (WTC, Book 1), his 
motet &ldquo;Jesu, meine Freude,&rdquo; and Liszt&rsquo;s <i>Sposalizio</i>.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">In his personal copy of the score to this Prelude (Oster 
Collection, New York Public Library for the Performing Arts), Ernst Oster also 
shows a 10&ndash;9 appoggiatura in measure 7.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Chopin&rsquo;s autograph, which has been published in 
facsimile, lacks a sharp sign before F4 in measure 19, thus forming another minor 
ninth with the bass. Some editions, including Ewald Zimmermann&rsquo;s for Henle, 
follow the autograph here. Most other editions read the note as F&#x266f;4. I assume 
that the note should be F&#x266f;4 partly <i>because</i> of the accent mark over A4 in measure 21. 
If measure 21 were merely a sequential transposition of measure 19, it is hard to see what 
purpose the accent would serve.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">The idea that the F4 at the end of measure 9 is a passing 
tone originates, so far as I know, with Ernst Oster, who noted the ascending 
third in his score of the Prelude (see note 14).</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Lussy describes the performance of ascending phrases 
(not only sequences) in terms of physical effort; see Lussy 1892, 165&ndash;66.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Frank Samarotto, &ldquo;A Theory of Temporal Plasticity in 
Tonal Music: An Extension of the Schenkerian Approach to Rhythm with Special 
Reference to Beethoven&rsquo;s Late Music&rdquo; (Ph.D. dissertation, City University of New 
York, 1999).</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">Lerdahl, <i>Tonal Pitch Space</i> (New York: Oxford 
University Press, 2001).</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">This principle might not hold when the first of two 
spaces contains very few notes per octave, and the succeeding space is heard to 
fill in elements of a normative space. An example would be the motion from 
fifth-space to triad-space to diatonic space at the beginning of Beethoven&rsquo;s 
Ninth Symphony (cited by Lerdahl on page 53).</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">Quoted in Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger, <i>Chopin, pianist 
and teacher, as seen by his pupils,</i> trans. Naomi Shohet (Cambridge: 
Cambridge University Press, 1986), 272.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">This principle is consonant with Lerdahl and 
Jackendoff&rsquo;s Grouping Preference Rule 2a, which addresses proximity of attack 
points (Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 45).</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">The situation in measures 42&ndash;43 differs in that the bass 
note does not change (it is enharmonically respelled), and the left hand leaps 
an octave across the bar line. These factors tend to encourage the treatment of 
the eighth notes in measure 42 as an upbeat, whereas the dissonant interval traversed 
by the left hand between measures 18 and 19&mdash;a major seventh spelled as a diminished 
octave&mdash;tends to encourage separation.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">Robert Philip, <i>Early recordings and musical style: 
changing tastes in instrumental performance, 1900&ndash;1950</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press, 1992).</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">In my decision to &ldquo;rush&rsquo; the two pedal points I again 
find myself in agreement with Lussy, who advises <i>accelerando</i> for long-held notes 
in the melody.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">Compare the Nocturne in E&#x266d; Major, op. 9, no. 2, 
where the 812 measure corresponds to the four-bar hypermeasure in Prelude No. 
21.</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">The use of &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; as a verb meaning &ldquo;to shape a 
phrase&rdquo; (in German, <i>phrasiren</i>) may be traced to Riemann 1884; I am not 
aware of this usage earlier. I criticized this use of &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; in <i>Phrase 
Rhythm in Tonal Music</i> (New York: Schirmer Books, 1989), 11&ndash;12.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">See Rowland <i>op. cit.</i> on the type of rubato in 
which the melody is shaped independently of the bass. A vestige of 
late-eighteenth-century practice, it was described by Mozart in a famous letter 
to his father (quoted in Rowland, 202). This type of rubato requires a clear 
textural distinction between the rhythms of melody and accompaniment, a 
distinction that does not exist in Prelude No. 17 but does exist in Nos. 13 and 
21.</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">That two simultaneous but conflicting grouping 
structures may coexist at the same level violates Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
Grouping Well-Formedness Rule 4 (Lerdahl and Jackendoff, 38). I would maintain, 
however, that conflicting low-level groupings are a part of everyday musical 
experience, especially in late-Baroque and Romantic music.</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">I am indebted to my colleague Joseph Straus, theorist 
and cellist <i>extraordinaire,</i> for information on cello technique.</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">Victor Zuckerkandl, <i>The Sense of Music </i>
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959), 122.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">There are comparable passages in Prelude No. 13. In measure 
6, for example, the leaps of sevenths, C&#x266f;3&ndash;D&#x266f;2 and F&#x266f;3&ndash;G&#x266f;2, suggest a temporary 
change to beginning-accented groups.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">See the present author&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chopin and the B-major 
complex: a study in the psychology of composition,&rdquo; <i>Ostinato rigore</i> 15 
(2000): 149&ndash;72.</div>
