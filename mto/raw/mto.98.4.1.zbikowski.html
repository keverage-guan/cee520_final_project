<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section1"><b>1. Introduction</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[1.1] In a recent set of exchanges on the smt-list, attention focused
momentarily on Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s claim in <i>Music, Imagination, and
Culture</i> that musical analysis was essentially metaphorical.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>Although there was considerable interest in the topic at the time,
fundamental aspects of Cook&rsquo;s claim were never considered in detail,
nor were its broader implications for music theory.  In the following
I would like to return to this claim, consider recent work on metaphor
by cognitive scientists that both supports and modifies Cook&rsquo;s
original claim, and suggest ways metaphor informs and shapes the ways
we theorize about music. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section2"><b>2. The metaphorical nature of musical analysis</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[2.1] As Cook notes, the perspective on musical analysis he presents 
in <i>Music, Imagination, and Culture</i> is informed by the work of the 
philosopher Roger Scruton.  Scruton directly addresses the metaphoricity 
of our accounts of music in his 1983 essay &ldquo;Understanding Music.&rdquo;  
Scruton&rsquo;s argument centers on a crucial distinction between sound and 
music.  Sound, from his perspective, is a material fact, and as such is 
a matter for scientific understanding.  Music, in contrast, is an 
intentional construct, a matter of the concepts through which we 
perceive the world.  The evidence for this distinction is provided by 
the metaphorical nature of our characterizations of music: although we
speak of &lsquo;musical space&rsquo; (and locate tones within it), this space does
not correspond, in a rational way, to physical space; although we
speak of &lsquo;musical motion,&rsquo; the motion is at best apparent, and not
real.  The concepts of space and motion are extended to music through
metaphorical transference as a way to account for certain aspects of
our experience of music.  These metaphors are not an addition to
musical understanding, but are in fact basic to it.  Scruton writes,</p>

<blockquote>
    <nobr> . . . </nobr>in our most basic apprehension of music there lies a
    complex system of metaphor, which is the true description of
    no material fact.  And the metaphor cannot be eliminated
    from the description of music, because it is integral to the
    intentional object of musical experience.  Take this
    metaphor away and you take away the experience of music.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>What Scruton sees as the unyielding metaphoricity of musical
understanding points to the intentional nature of music, and leads him
to assert that &ldquo;Music belongs uniquely to the intentional sphere, and
not to the material realm.  Any analysis of music must be an exercise
in intentional rather than scientific understanding.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.2] In his book Cook adopts Scruton&rsquo;s argument in a very explicit way,
and makes it specific to the concerns of music theory.  Speaking of
Schenkerian analysis in the introduction, Cook writes, &ldquo;A Schenkerian
analysis is not a scientific explanation, but a metaphorical one; it
is not an account of how people actually hear pieces of music, but a
way of imagining them.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Cook also extends Scruton&rsquo;s argument by
overtly linking the way we imagine music to the ontology of musical
cultures: &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>a musical culture is, in essence, a repertoire of
means for imagining music; it is the specific pattern of divergences
between the experience of music on the one hand, and the images by
means of which it is represented on the other, that gives a musical
culture its identity.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> In consequence, the metaphoricity of musical
understanding is not only inescapable, but is in fact connected with
the establishment of musical cultures.
</p>

<p>[2.3] Although Scruton&rsquo;s (and, by extension, Cook&rsquo;s) assertion about the
metaphoricity of musical understanding occurs as part of a larger
rationalistic argument about musical ontology, there is a body of recent
empirical work by cognitive scientists that supports this assertion.  This
research suggests that metaphor is not simply an anomalous use of language
or a mark of the way we conceive intentional objects but is in fact central
to human understanding as a whole.  This research is also distinct from
other discussions of the importance of metaphor to musical understanding,
whether from a philosophical<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> or music-analytical<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> perspective, in that
it offers a way to explain why correlations of the sort noted by Scruton&mdash;
between musical pitch and physical space, or between successions of pitches
and motion through physical space&mdash;are possible in the first place, and
how such correlations are constrained. 
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section3"><b>3. Metaphor as a fundamental structure of human thought</b></a></p>

<p>[3.1] Perhaps the most common conception of metaphor is of a literary 
device, a manifestation of the figural use of language to create 
colorful if imprecise images.  However, in 1980 George Lakoff and Mark 
Johnson presented an alternative view: metaphor, they argued, was not 
simply a manifestation of literary creativity, but was in fact pervasive 
in everyday discourse.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>  As an example, consider the way the spatial 
orientation of <i>up-down</i> is used to characterize emotions:</p>

<blockquote>
    I&rsquo;m feeling <i>up</i>.  My spirits <i>rose</i>.  I&rsquo;m feeling <i>down</i>.<br>
    I <i>fell</i> into a <i>depression</i>.  My spirits <i>sank</i>.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>consciousness:</p>

<blockquote>
    Get <i>up</i>.  I&rsquo;m <i>up</i> already.  He <i>rises</i> early in the
    morning.  He <i>fell</i> asleep.
</blockquote>

<p>and health:</p>

<blockquote>
    He&rsquo;s at the <i>peak</i> of health.  Lazarus <i>rose</i> from the dead.<br>
    She&rsquo;s in <i>top</i> shape.  He came <i>down</i> with the flu.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Each characterization suggests not a literal representation of the spatial
domain implied by the orientation <i>up-down</i>, but instead uses our knowledge
of physical space to structure our understanding of emotions,
consciousness, or health.
</p>

<p>[3.2] Based on evidence provided by a large number of similar 
examples of the appearance of metaphorical constructions in everyday 
discourse, Lakoff and Johnson proposed that metaphor was a basic 
structure of understanding through which we conceptualize one domain 
(typically unfamiliar or abstract&mdash;the target domain) in terms of 
another (most often familiar and concrete&mdash;the source domain).  Further 
study has provided a wealth of empirical evidence for this proposal 
and contributed to the development of the field of cognitive linguistics.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.3] Fundamental to the theory of metaphor that sprang from Lakoff and
Johnson&rsquo;s work is a distinction between conceptual metaphors and linguistic
metaphors.  A conceptual metaphor is a cognitive mapping between two
different domains; a linguistic metaphor is an expression of such a mapping
through language.  For instance, the conceptual metaphor STATE OF BEING IS
ORIENTATION IN VERTICAL SPACE maps relationships in physical space onto
mental and physical states.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>  The cross-domain mapping wrought by this
conceptual metaphor then gives rise to innumerable linguistic expressions.
Some of these expressions are commonplace, such as &ldquo;John seems a bit <i>down</i>
today&rdquo; or any of the similar statements given above.  Others are highly
poetic, as demonstrated by the opening of Keats&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to a Nightingale&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
    My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br>
        My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,<br>
    Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains<br>
        One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Here the descent to the mythical river gives a physical correlate to the
narcotic state of the narrator&mdash;the act of sinking is mapped onto a
melancholy emotional state&mdash;and serves as yet another expression of the
conceptual metaphor STATE OF BEING IS ORIENTATION IN VERTICAL SPACE.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.4] The process of cross-domain mapping offers a systematic way to explain
our commonplace notions of musical space.  There is ample evidence that our
characterization of musical pitches in terms of &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; is
basically metaphorical.  Consider &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; on the piano: how can D4
be &ldquo;above&rdquo; C4 on the piano when they are both on the same horizontal plane?
Think of playing the two notes on the &lsquo;cello&mdash;to play the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; D4,
we have to move our left hand <i>down</i>, so that it is closer to the ground.
Behind these linguistic expressions is the conceptual metaphor PITCH
RELATIONSHIPS ARE RELATIONSHIPS IN VERTICAL SPACE, which maps spatial
orientations such as <i>up-down</i> onto the pitch continuum.
</p>

<p>[3.5] Although Scruton argued that it was virtually inconceivable to construe
pitch in any way other than an <i>up-down</i> spatial relationship, evidence to
the contrary comes from a variety of sources.  Greek music theorists of
antiquity spoke not of &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; but of &ldquo;sharpness&rdquo; and
&ldquo;heaviness&rdquo;; in Bali and Java pitches are not &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; but &ldquo;small&rdquo;
and &ldquo;large&rdquo;; and among the Suy&aacute; of the Amazon basin, pitches are not
&ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; but &ldquo;young&rdquo; and &ldquo;old.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>  The differences among these
ways of characterizing musical pitch suggests that the understanding of
music is profoundly metaphorical: not only is the <i>high</i> and <i>low</i> of
musical pitch metaphorical, but it is only one of a number of ways to
characterize pitch relations.
</p>

<p>[3.6] The variety of conceptual metaphors used to characterize pitch
relations leads to the question of the ultimate grounding of the process of
cross-domain mapping.  Even if we grant that we understand a target domain
(such as pitch relationships) in terms of a source domain (such as
orientation in vertical space), how is it that we understand the source
domain in the first place? Mark Johnson endeavored to answer this question
by proposing that meaning was grounded in repeated patterns of bodily
experience.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>  These patterns give rise to what Johnson called <i>image
schemata</i>, which provide the basis for the concepts and relationships
essential to metaphor.  An image schema is a dynamic cognitive construct
that functions somewhat like the abstract structure of an image, and
thereby connects up a vast range of different experiences that manifest
this same recurring structure.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>  Image schemata are by no means visual
&mdash;the idea of an image is simply a way of capturing the organization
inferred from patterns in behavior and concept formation.

<p>[3.7] As one example of an image schema, consider the VERTICALITY schema,
which might be summarized by a diagram of the sort given in <b>Example 1</b>.  We
grasp this structure repeatedly in thousands of perceptions and activities
that we experience every day.  Typical of these are the experiences of
perceiving a tree, our felt sense of standing upright, the activity of
climbing stairs, forming a mental image of a flagpole, and watching the
level of water rise in the bathtub.  The VERTICALITY schema is the abstract
structure of the VERTICALITY experiences, images, and perceptions.  Our
concept of verticality is based on this schema, and this concept is in turn
invoked by the various conceptual metaphors that use vertical space as a
source domain through which to structure target domains such as emotions,
consciousness, health, and musical pitch.</p>

<p>

[3.8] By definition, image schemata are preconceptual: they are not
concepts, but they provide the fundamental structure upon which concepts
are based.  In consequence, it is important to emphasize that the diagrams
used to illustrate image schemata are intended to represent the key
structural features and internal relations of image schemata; they are not
meant to summon a rich image or mental picture that we somehow have &ldquo;in
mind,&rdquo; and use to actively structure our thought.  More directly, whatever
actually occupies our thoughts isn&rsquo;t, by definition, an image schema.  We
can conceive <i>of</i> image schemata, just as we can conceive of any of a
number of non-conceptual or preconceptual cognitive processes.  We can also
note general patterns in the way concepts are structured, which can be
attributed to image schemata.  However, there are, by definition, no
&lsquo;image-schema concepts.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.9] The relationship between the VERTICALITY schema and our
characterization of musical pitch with reference to the spatial orientation
<i>up-down</i> is fairly immediate: when we make <i>low</i> sounds, our chest
resonates; when we make <i>high</i> sounds, our chest no longer resonates in the
same way, and the source of the sound seems located nearer our head.  The
&ldquo;up&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; of musical pitch thus correlate with the spatial &ldquo;up&rdquo; and
&ldquo;down&rdquo;&mdash;the vertical orientation&mdash;of our bodies.  The VERTICALITY
schema offers a straightforward way to explain why we characterize musical
pitch in terms of <i>high</i> and <i>low</i> even when the actual spatial orientation
of the means through which we produce pitches either does not reinforce the
characterization or runs directly counter to it.
</p>

<p>[3.10] The theory of image schemata provides one way of explaining how
conceptual metaphors are grounded.  However, it does not, by itself,
explain why some conceptual metaphors seem intuitively better than others.
For instance, the conceptual metaphor PITCHES ARE FRUIT could provide the
grounding for such (admittedly idiosyncratic) expressions as &ldquo;You must play
the first note more like an apple, the second more like a banana.&rdquo;  To
account for why some metaphorical mappings are more effective than others,
George Lakoff and Mark Turner proposed that such mappings are not about the
<i>imposition</i> of the structure of the source domain on the target domain,
but are instead about the establishment of correspondences between the two
domains.  These correspondences are not haphazard, but instead preserve the
image-schematic structure latent in each domain.  Lakoff and Turner
formalized this perspective with the Invariance Principle, which Turner
states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    In metaphoric mapping, for those components of the source
    and target domains determined to be involved in the mapping,
    preserve the image-schematic structure of the target, and
    import as much image-schematic structure from the source as
    is consistent with that preservation.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[3.11] Mapping the spatial orientation <i>up-down</i> onto pitch works because of
correspondences between the image-schematic structure of components of the
spatial and acoustical domains.  Both space and the frequency spectrum are
continua that can be divided into discontinuous elements.  In the spatial
domain, division of the continuum results in points; in the acoustic
domain, it results in pitches.  Mapping <i>up-down</i> onto pitch allows us to
import the concrete relationships through which we understand physical
space into the domain of music, and thereby provide a coherent account of
relationships between musical pitches.  Mapping various fruits onto musical
pitches works less well because fruit do not (in any ordinary way)
constitute a continuum. To employ this mapping is to highlight instead the
discontinuity among musical pitches, as well as how they are <i>unlike</i> one
another (an emphasis on difference suggested by the idiomatic phrase &ldquo;like
apples and oranges&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>[3.12] One additional factor that guides cross-domain mapping is cultural
knowledge.  As seen above, different cultures have different ways of
organizing their understanding of pitch relationships; the same goes for
virtually every other aspect of music.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup>  According to one theory,
conceptual metaphors reflect the influence of idealized cognitive models,
which are knowledge structures that guide inference and reason and that are
part of the knowledge that is essential to culture.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup>  I shall not
attempt a review of such knowledge structures here<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup>; however, it is
worth noting that such structures provide the mechanism through which the
&lsquo;repertoire of means for imagining music&rsquo; spoken of by Cook may be
effected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>4. Summary</b></a></p>

<p>[4.1] Research over the past two decades has made a strong
argument that metaphor is not simply an anomalous use of language but is in
fact central to human understanding.  Fundamental to the linguistic
expression of metaphor are conceptual metaphors, which establish mappings
between two domains.  The theory of image schemata provides a way to
explain how conceptual metaphors are grounded, as well as how metaphorical
mappings between domains are constrained.
</p>

<p>[4.2] Inasmuch as music theory is part of human understanding, it follows
that metaphor must play a part in our theories of music.  In light of this,
Cook&rsquo;s claim that &lsquo;a Schenkerian analysis is not a scientific explanation,
but a metaphorical one&rsquo; seems inevitable.  However, the claim, as such, is
only a beginning.  Research on metaphor not only gives support to the
claim, but also obligates the claimant to undertake a systematic
elaboration of <i>how</i> metaphor is instantiated in Schenker&rsquo;s&mdash;or anyone&rsquo;s
&mdash;accounts of music.  In the following, I would like to give examples of
two applications of research on metaphor to music theory, and briefly
discuss two extensions of research on metaphor that hold promise for a
better understanding of how we conceptualize music.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>5. Applications to music theory</b></a></p>

<p>[5.1] An understanding of the role of metaphor in structuring our
thought can be used to make explicit the bases of the theoretical
constructs that guide our understanding of music.  Consider, for
instance, the notions embraced by the German word <i>Spannung</i> as
it is used by Schenker in <i>Der freie Satz</i>.  Here are two
passages in which the term is prominent:</p>

<blockquote>
     Den Menschen is die Erfahrung eines Endes, des Erl&ouml;schens
     aller <i>Spannungen</i> und Ziele gegeben.  In diesem Sinne ist
     es uns ein nat&uuml;rliches Bed&uuml;rfnis, auch die Urlinie bis
     hinab zum Grundton 1 zu f&uuml;hren, wie auch den Bau wieder
     zum Grundton des Klanges zur&uuml;ckfallen zu lassen; mit 1/I
     erl&ouml;schen alle <i>Spannungen</i> eines Kunstorganismus. (1956:
     section 10, page 43; emphasis added)  [To man is given the
     experience of ending, the cessation of all tensions and
     efforts.  In this sense, we feel by nature that the
     fundamental line must lead downward until it reaches 1, and
     that the bass must fall back to the fundamental.  With 1/I
     all tensions in a musical work cease. (1979: section 10, page
     13)]
     </blockquote>

    <blockquote>Freilich, bei <i>Spannungen</i> ueber gr&ouml;ssere Strecken ist
     Genie, die Gabe der Improvisation und des Weithorens
     Voraussetzung. (1956: section 30, page 50; emphasis added)  [But
     genius, the gift of improvisation and long-range hearing is
     requisite for greater time spans. (1979: section 30, page
     18)]<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[5.2] In the first passage <i>Spannung</i> invokes a conceptual metaphor that
correlates the domain of human experience with that of pitch organization;
in its broadest form, this metaphor could be stated as MUSICAL PITCHES ARE
LIVING ORGANISMS.  This conceptual metaphor is important throughout
Schenker&rsquo;s work, and is associated with his interpretation of pitch
relationships as highly dynamic.
</p>

<p>[5.3] A different conceptual metaphor underlies the second passage.  This
metaphor correlates the domain of physical structure with the elements of
music, and can be rendered as MUSICAL ENTITIES ARE PARTS OF A BUILDING.
The &lsquo;spans over large stretches&rsquo; spoken of by Schenker suggest a rather
more static image than the first use of <i>Spannung</i>, and one that is
directly linked to the notion of &lsquo;structure&rsquo; that pervades much analytical
writing.
</p>

<p>[5.4] It is important to note that these two conceptual metaphors, although
invoked by the same word, are incommensurate.  The tension inherent in
living beings is not the same thing as a span across physical space.
Although we might speak of such a span as being &ldquo;under tension,&rdquo; this
tension can be correlated with life-force only through metaphor.  It must
also be noted that Schenker&rsquo;s theory of music is in no way deficient in its
reliance on a number of conceptual metaphors, for the metaphors serve
different purposes.  The image evoked by the use of <i>Spannung</i> in the first
passage comes from a perspective that views music as highly charged and
<i>essentially</i> dynamic. This perspective, engaged and at times passionate,
is one of the things that makes Schenker a compelling writer.  The image
evoked by the use of <i>Spannung</i> in the second passage comes from a
perspective that views music as a made object consisting of components and
relations.  This perspective is a more familiar, &ldquo;music-theoretical&rdquo; one,
well suited to the deliberate contemplation of musical relations conducive
to systematic theorizing and to pedagogy.
</p>

<p>[5.5] My discussion of the role of metaphor in structuring our music-
theoretical thought is of necessity brief; however, I can note three, more
extensive treatments of the topic.  In one recent article Janna Saslaw
offers a detailed analysis of the modulation theory of Hugo Riemann in
light of current research into metaphor; Saslaw also provides an invaluable
summary of image-schema theory.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> In another article, Saslaw discusses
metaphorical manifestations of force schemata in the theories of Schenker
and Arnold Schoenberg.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>  And in a forthcoming essay, I explore the way
two models of hierarchy are mapped onto music, and how these mappings
constrain our inferences about musical organization.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>  The discussions
of the role of metaphor in structuring our music-theoretical thought that
are undertaken in these three essays elaborate many points that are only
glossed here.
</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>. Measures 53 through 58 of the Credo of the <i>Pope Marcellus Mass</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="zbikowski_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="zbikowski_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[5.6] Research into metaphor can also be used to explain more immediate,
less overtly theoretical ways that we understand music.  As an example, let
us consider a bit of text painting from the Credo of Giovanni da
Palestrina&rsquo;s <i>Pope Marcellus Mass</i>; the music is given in <b>Example 2</b>.  As
can be seen, with the first occurrence of the word &ldquo;descendit,&rdquo; each voice
begins a scalar descent.  The commonplace answer to why this text painting
works is that the descent evoked by the text correlates with the descent
through musical space. However, as I showed above, there is no necessity to
this correlation: &ldquo;descendit&rdquo; also correlates with an increase in
heaviness, an increase in the size of the notes, and the growing age of
each note.  Which two domains are correlated depends only on the conceptual
metaphor used to structure pitch relations.  A fall-back answer is that the
correlation between physical space and musical pitch is simply stylized:
although there is no necessity to it, it has been done so often that we
readily accept the mapping.  A somewhat more interesting answer is that the
physical sensations associated with descent are well represented by a
series of pitches produced by successively less-rapid vibrations of the
sounding medium.  The descent of our bodies through physical space (unaided
by artificial means) involves a lessening of kinetic energy and a
continuous action in one direction, articulated by the regular transfer of
weight from one leg to another.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup>  The DESCENT image schema will include
these sensations, as well as a motion downward in physical space.  The act
of singing a descending scale correlates well with the basic structure of
this image schema: the relaxation many singers feel as they sing a
descending scale matches the lessening of kinetic energy; the temporary
pauses on each note of the scale match the regular transfer of weight which
articulates a physical descent.  The text painting of &ldquo;desc&eacute;ndit&rdquo; is thus
supported by our embodied knowledge of descent.  Although the text painting
is not necessary, it seems so intuitively right that it is only with a
struggle that we can imagine the alternatives.</p>

<p>[5.7] This approach could be extended to provide an account of such
kinesthetic notions as gesture, tension, and release.  Grounding such
notions in embodied knowledge was proposed by Ray Jackendoff a full ten
years ago.  Jackendoff proposed that music is represented cognitively
through a level of mental representation he called <i>bodily representation</i>,
&ldquo;essentially a body-specific encoding of the internal sense of the states
of the muscles, limbs, and joints.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>  However, because Jackendoff took
the position that musical knowledge was non-conceptual, there is no
explicit link between bodily representation and conceptual representation.
There is, however, such a link between image schemata and concepts.
Image-schema theory may also provide a way to address the oft-noted
emotional aspect of music by building on Zolt&aacute;n K&ouml;vecses&rsquo;s work on
emotion concepts, which K&ouml;vecses has argued are based on conceptual
metaphors.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>

<p>[5.8] Finally, two extensions of work in cross-domain mapping hold promise
for investigating the structure of musical thought.  In his argument for
the importance of figurative thought to human understanding, Raymond Gibbs
makes a strong case for metonymy (where the part stands for the whole) as
well as metaphor as an essential cognitive process.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Gibbs&rsquo;s analysis
of metonymy gives a way to approach systematically the practice of musical
allusion, especially where this allusion is used to invoke the <i>function</i>
as well as the affect of the larger section of music recalled through the
allusion.  Other researchers have recently proposed expanding the
conventional two-domain model of cross-domain mapping to four (or more)
domains as a way of more completely accounting for the blending and
integration of concepts.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> I have used this approach to provide an
explanation for the unique cultural product that, at times, is the result
of combining words and music through song.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section6"><b>6. Conclusion</b></a></p>

<p>[6.1] Recent work on metaphor by cognitive scientists has
much to offer music theory: a systematic approach to the role of metaphor
in structuring our music-theoretical thought; a means to integrate embodied
knowledge into the ways we understand music; and theoretical paradigms for
extending and modifying the application of cross-domain mapping to music.
There seems little doubt that musical analyses are not scientific
explanations, but metaphorical ones.  It remains to explore the nature and
depth of these metaphors, and, in doing so, to come to a better
appreciation of the processes through which we organize our understanding
of music.</p>

Indirect evidence is provided by a striking anecdote related by John

In order to get to a group of Kurdish refugees on a remote edge of Iraqi
Kurdistan during the aftermath of the Gulf War, Hockenberry, a paraplegic
since 1976, had to temporarily abandon his wheelchair and get a ride on a
donkey.  He comments on the effect of becoming reacquainted with a
non-wheeled mode of transportation through the rhythm of the donkey&rsquo;s gait:
&ldquo;It was walking, that feeling of groping and climbing and floating on
stilts that I had not felt for fifteen years.  I had long ago grown to love
my own wheels and their special physical grace, and so this clumsy leg walk
was not something I missed until the sensation came rushing back through my

discourse about music, and often plays a part in semiotic analyses of music
(inasmuch as the attribution of linguistic tropes to musical events is
oftentimes dependent on this metaphor).
For an intriguing analytical essay that uses the MUSIC IS A LANGUAGE
metaphor as a point of departure, see Justin London, &ldquo;Musical and
Linguistic Speech Acts,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i> 54, no.

most part, the image schema remains a theoretical construct.  Nonetheless,
two independent lines of research have leant credence to the notion:
Raymond W. Gibbs Jr. and Herbert L. Colston provide a review of evidence
for image schemata drawn from a wide variety of psychological studies in
&ldquo;The Cognitive Psychological Reality of Image Schemas and Their
Transformations,&rdquo; <i>Cognitive Linguistics</i> 6, no. 4 (1995): 347&ndash;78; Gerald
Edelman discusses connections between image-schema theory and research in
neuroscience in <i>The Remembered Present: A Biological Theory of
Consciousness</i> (New York: Basic Books, 1989), chapter 8.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">It is also important to note that image schemata do not simply reduce
to gestures, nor gestures to image schemata.  For a discussion, see David
McNeill, <i>Hand and Mind: What Gestures Reveal About Thought</i> (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1992), 263&ndash;64.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Mark Turner, &ldquo;Aspects of the Invariance Hypothesis,&rdquo; <i>Cognitive
