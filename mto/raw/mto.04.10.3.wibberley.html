model will hereinafter be called the OSU Model. Any language&mdash;written or spoken&mdash;is a code. Through this code the ideas of the originator can be understood by the recipient, and any
language thus learnt becomes a suitable and effective medium for
scientific or artistic intellectual communication. In this respect the language
of tonal music is no different from any other language. As a medium it
has its own syntax and structure. But as with any other language its
effectiveness as a means of discourse rests upon the assumption
that the syntax used by the originator (here the composer) is the same
as that to be understood by the recipient (here the listener or
the performer). In an age such as ours&mdash;far removed from the musical
syntax used by those living and working in the age of Bach, Mozart
and Haydn&mdash;we can only approach the ideas communicated by those
of the distant past by revealing exactly what is encoded in the notes they
wrote: these are all we have. To understand them is not obvious,
self-evident or in any way instinctive to us who live in the 21st
Century, and neither could it be. In order to decode such music we must
ourselves relearn the code employed. We may then be able to
understand not only how they used the syntax, but (arguably more urgently)
why and when they employed it in the ways they did.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] It is my belief that a meaningful understanding of any composer&rsquo;s 
model rests upon the forensic identification of three clear 
attributes: Motive, Means and Opportunity. Of these, we can simply 
view each surviving written musical note (in whatever context) as an 
instance of Opportunity: whatever may have been the reason (or 
Motive) for writing it, and whatever may have been the factors that 
bear upon using it in that way (these constituting the Means), its 
consequent use stemming from these two attributes marked the 
Opportunity evidenced by its committal to paper. Within this 
unbreakable chain of creative activity&mdash;which begins with a Motive&mdash;Opportunity can be seen only as the final link.
<p>[2] The difficulty with any model, including the OSU Model, is that 
statistical information alone can only record countless numbers of 
individual opportunities. In this instance the OSU Model has sampled 
2643 four-part triads from Bach&rsquo;s chorale harmonizations, together 
with 960 four-part triads from the string quartets of Haydn and 
Mozart. Through an analysis of the note-doubling and chord-spacing 
tendencies that have been recorded and processed by this model, clear 
principles for &ldquo;correct&rdquo; spacing and doubling can&mdash;it is believed&mdash;be codified. Yet these principles or &ldquo;rules&rdquo; can only provide an 
abstract insight into the composer&rsquo;s Means (i.e. his specific 
technical articulations) that identify each individual Opportunity 
(i.e. each specific recorded instance of triad notation). No such 
model can explore a composer&rsquo;s actual reason or Motive for realizing 
an opportunity in the way he did.

</p>

<p>[3] What I am suggesting is that a composer&rsquo;s choice of note doubling 
or chord spacing (or anything else for that matter) was never made 
simply in order to follow established rules and procedures. Rather 
each choice was made only because it was a composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;preferred 
solution&rdquo; that was deemed <i>at that moment</i> to be aesthetically and 
artistically the best available. As soon as musical practice is 
described in terms of &ldquo;rules&rdquo; we immediately step away from the 
language of the musician and become engaged with that of the 
theorist. What therefore begins life as an artistic musical 
expression then simply ends up trapped in the world of 
&ldquo;theorist-speak.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> I should therefore like to examine the workings 
of the OSU Model, and to consider exactly what its pronouncements 
reveal. This examination will, I think, have more to say about the 
Model than about the music it tries to analyze.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="wibberley_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 1 thumbnail" src="wibberley_fig1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[4] The first procedure, therefore, must be to test the OSU Model in 
order to probe its brain. For this purpose I clicked on the sidebar 
headed &ldquo;Can you beat the computer?&rdquo; and then selected one of each 
pair of radio buttons. The result that was returned can be viewed as 
<b>Figure 1</b>.

</p>

<p>
[5] As readers will notice, I decided&mdash;irrespective of whatever 
chords had been presented&mdash;automatically to select alternately the 
first then the second of each alternate pair (i.e. for the first pair 
I selected chord 1, for the second pair chord 2, for the third pair 
chord 1 and so on). My score of &ldquo;60%&rdquo; (being above average) in no way 
therefore resulted from musical decision-making. Indeed had I decided 
at the outset to select chords in the opposite order (i.e. starting 
with chord 2, then chord 1 etc.) my score would have been only &ldquo;40%.&rdquo; 
What is of greater interest, however, is to note that the OSU Model&rsquo;s 
own score was only &ldquo;50%&rdquo; verifiable when each of its own decisions 
is compared with what is stated as being &ldquo;The correct answer.&rdquo; By 
&ldquo;The correct answer&rdquo; (which must therefore be not only predetermined 
by the OSU Model, but also then rendered independent from its own 
adjudication, even though the raw data that define it are contained 
within the same Model) we have to assume that the &ldquo;correctness&rdquo; of 
each example rests solely upon its authority as having been 
specifically <i>selected</i> as a real composed chord. The alternative 
choice in each case is by analogy &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; not because it does not 
also exist in the repertory as a composed chord, but rather because 
it did not happen to be the <i>actual</i> composed chord chosen for the 
test (being instead a randomly reconstituted version of that chord). 
One, however, is stated as being &ldquo;correct&rdquo; while the other must 
therefore be inferred as &ldquo;incorrect.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>
</p>
<p>[6] This particular example of &ldquo;theorist-speak&rdquo; has therefore 
introduced two new technical terms that need urgent qualification: 
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; and (by inference) &ldquo;incorrect.&rdquo; Unless they are so qualified 
and clarified a confusion in the minds of students will immediately 
exist. They will perhaps take the words at face value (not 
understanding that these words are themselves merely code) and then 
mistakenly believe that certain chord spacings and doublings are 
empirically correct merely because they (the students) have 
misunderstood what is here meant by the coded word &ldquo;correct.&rdquo; Perhaps 
the greater hazard is presented by the inference that certain triadic 
configurations are (by default) incorrect. Again taken at face value, 
the use of the coded (but here only deductively inferred) term 
&ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; may lead students to assume that such configurations are 
to be avoided. This, again, is because the student will have failed 
to understand that the inferred term &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; means absolutely 
<i>not</i> that the particular chord was not freely used by the composers, 
but only (and merely) that the particular test did not select it as 
the raw material from which a restructured version was created. It is 
therefore obvious, surely, that the OSU Model is being neither 
prescriptive nor proscriptive. Nobody can possibly know which 
particular chords actually were the pre-selected &ldquo;correct,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;composed&rdquo; chords as opposed to being those that were 
computer-generated alternative versions of the same. Indeed the OSU 
Model&mdash;even though it obviously begins its operation by knowing 
which are which&mdash;is even itself denied such knowledge at the point 
of its own adjudication. The danger is, surely, that we might be led 
to believe that the OSU Model&rsquo;s own judgment is likely to be 
significantly (or at all) better than our own. But is it, and if so 
where is the evidence?

</p>
<p>[7] As Figure 1 demonstrates, the Model scored only 50% as against my 
own 60%. Yet it must be remembered that my score resulted from no 
musical decision-making whatsoever. Had I seen fit to indulge in 
this, I might well have managed a higher score&mdash;who knows? What is 
particularly alarming, however, is that the Model was apparently 
unable to avoid getting 50% of its own answers &ldquo;wrong.&rdquo;  As the Model 
states, a score of 50% is the target score when chords are chosen 
only randomly; but here the Model was supposed to be making informed judgments.  I am no more  impressed by the authors&rsquo; claim that a 
Model score of 70% is acceptable, especially since this is only 10% 
better than a score I have achieved on the basis of zero musical 
judgment and insight.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Such a score also presupposes that the 
Model&rsquo;s failure to avoid getting as many as 30% of its own answers 
wrong is &ldquo;acceptable.&rdquo; Is this credible?

</p>
<p>[8] The starting point must be an examination of some of the numerous 
instances where those chords deemed (inferentially) to be &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; 
are to be found in the actual surviving music. Unlike the OSU Model, 
we may then be in a position to perceive through the &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; 
presented some tangible &ldquo;motives&rdquo; that explain the &ldquo;means.&rdquo; It will 
also elevate (of necessity) the status of those chords from 
&ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;correct&rdquo; (since the examples now to be given 
will also be actual &ldquo;composed&rdquo; examples). These have currently been 
denied to the OSU Model even though they freely exist in the 
repertory alongside the others.

</p>
<p>[9] For this examination I have decided to restrict myself to the 
Bach chorale harmonizations, but have little doubt that a similarly 
fruitful exercise could be undertaken also with reference to the 
quartet repertory. In what follows, therefore, only the first five 
examples (i.e. the first row of chords) from Figure 1 will be 
re-appraised.

</p>
<p>[10] The Model recognizes that key is important (and therefore the 
tests all state the keys within which given triads are deemed to 
exist). A particular triad can therefore be properly assessed only in 
relation to the prevailing key within which it is used. The triad 
f-c'-f'-a'' is, for example, likely to exist because of particular 
voice-leading and harmonic requirements when it functions within the 
key of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major that differ from those applying to C major. Also the 
relationship of chord spacing to tonal and voice-leading functions 
may differ according to key since in certain keys the equivalent 
spacing may result in poor vocal range. For these reasons it is 
important to respect the keys that apply to each of the examples.

</p>
<p>[11] I should submit, however, that key is not intrinsically <i>so</i> 
important that the harmonic, chord-spacing and voice-leading syntax 
used for a chorale in (say) <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major will be in any way different 
from that used in the key of (say) D major (lying only a semitone 
lower in pitch). Both keys have effectively identical vocal ranges, 
both are major keys, and the tonal language in both must basically be 
identical. On the other hand, I should assume that the chord spacing 
for a chorale in G major <i>must</i> differ from that used in C major 
(which lies a fifth lower in pitch). If that used in the second is 
merely a replication of that found in the first, it is obvious that 
either the upper voices will be too high in pitch, or the lower too 
low. Under these conditions, therefore, one should expect to find a 
difference in the way chords are configured.

</p>
<p>[12] In Figure 1, three simultaneous choices are unanimously selected 
for the first pair of chords (but all for totally different reasons): 
first, the Model indicates by the red shading that the first chord of 
the pair was the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; chord (i.e. the one actually taken as a 
&ldquo;composed&rdquo; chord, its knowledge of this fact being then independent 
from its own subsequent adjudication); second, the OSU Model selected 
it as being the more likely of the two to have been &ldquo;composed&rdquo; (being 
at that point unaware that it had previously been entered in any case 
as &ldquo;correct&rdquo;); third, I chose it purely because for that one I 
selected the first (in a system of pragmatic alternate selections). 
We all agreed (for very different reasons) that the first chord was 
&ldquo;correct.&rdquo; But what about the second?

</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Riemenschneider 5: Wasserfl&uuml;ssen Babylon (mm. 10&ndash;14)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="wibberley_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="wibberley_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[13] The three independent reasons why the second chord was 
&ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; are: first, the Model indicates that the first was indeed 
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; (knowing initially that it was the given chord from which 
it then recomposed the notes to arrive at for the second); second, 
the Model (being, after that, rendered  innocent to the previous 
facts) adjudicated that the layout of the first was &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the 
second; and third, I selected the first because (and only because) it 
was the first chord. (For the next one I shall have pragmatically 
selected the second.) The conclusion is therefore undoubtedly that 
the second chord is &ldquo;incorrect.&rdquo; But as can now be seen below in 
<b>Example 1</b>, it occurs quite unashamedly and routinely as a &ldquo;composed&rdquo; 
chord deliberately chosen by Bach (in preference to all others) as 
being the most suitable for the purpose.
</p>
<p>[14] Why, therefore, did Bach place the alto on a', thereby creating 
the large gap between the two inner voices (which obviously offended 
the OSU Model)? Only by understanding his motive (rather than merely 
perceiving his means) can this question be answered. But the OSU 
Model is not equipped to adjudicate upon the motive, being capable 
only of noting the means and thereby recording yet another 
opportunity (in this case perhaps a rare one). An answer can be 
arrived at by understanding that here the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>f<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> in the tenor voice is 
not merely a passing tone between two chords (A minor and G major), 
but is indeed a crucial harmony tone creating a modulation back to G 
major. As such it functions as the leading tone within a 
first-inversion leading-tone triad in which the third (a) is here 
doubled in preference to either of the other notes (the root <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>f<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, and 
the fifth c). To have doubled the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>f<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> would have been poor (and the 
article correctly stresses that doubled leading tones are avoided for 
voice-leading reasons); and to have doubled the c (by leaving the 
alto on the same note as it occupied in the previous chord) would 
have imposed poor voicing with the tenor (yielding pseudo-parallels). 
This surely explains &ldquo;why&rdquo; this configuration (despite the Model&rsquo;s 
prejudices) is here undoubtedly the most correct, preferred one. So 
the dubious status accorded to it by the Model is only dubious 
because a) the other one was the Model&rsquo;s starting point, and b) the 
Model had no means of judging a circumstance under which this 
configuration might be preferable.

</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>.

<p>[15] Returning to Figure 1, the second pair of chords shows the model 
to have made an &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; choice. This is because it did not know 
(as I also did not) that in fact it was the second of the pair that 
had been provided as the composed data. (The Model did, of course, 
originally &ldquo;know&rdquo; this, but only before it was then instructed to 
forget it in order to make an impartial adjudication.) But as <b>Example 2</b> below shows, the configuration chosen (&ldquo;incorrectly&rdquo;) by the Model 
also freely occurs. Within the context provided here, the layout and spacing is the only 
obvious one. While this chorale could be said to be in A minor, it 
really belongs to the kind described within the article as &ldquo;modal&rdquo; 
rather than &ldquo;tonal.&rdquo; It might be argued, therefore, that when this 
chord arrives the passing tonality is really F major rather than A 
minor. Nonetheless its function is part of an overall modulation from 
A minor to D minor. The apparent tonality of C major (at the 
beginning of the phrase) results only from the modal character which, 
within a tonal context of A minor, makes C major harmony freely 
available.

</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b>.

<p>[16] The third pair of chords in Figure 1 provides two configurations 
that, without question, are both completely routine and as likely to 
be found. While the second is &ldquo;correct&rdquo; (being the actual given one) 
both I and the Model have selected the first (being therefore 
&ldquo;incorrect&rdquo;). The Model has performed more poorly than I have 
however, because while my selection was deliberately made without 
exercising any musical judgment at all, its was supposed to be a 
musically-preferred selection. But as can be seen below in <b>Example 3</b>, 
both chords are freely used. The &ldquo;correct&rdquo; chord appears on the third beat of measure 1, while the 
&ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; one becomes the ultimate goal of the whole phrase (i.e. 
the final chord). Who could possibly deny that this &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; chord 
is the only one that clearly fulfils all the voice-leading, melodic 
and harmonic requirements of the phrase? What actual choice (as such) 
is therefore offered by the Model? Like completing a lottery ticket, 
the hope can only be (for whatever amusement purpose) that the final 
guess will miraculously concur with the programmer&rsquo;s unknown (and 
unknowable) random selection.

</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[17] The fourth pair of chords shown in Figure 1 again offers little 
means for making an informed choice, since either chord can (and 
does) freely occur in the repertory. Particular usage arises only 
from the voice-leading requirements at any particular moment, and 
there is no basis for believing that the second chord (here deemed 
the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; one) is any more likely than the first. Indeed the OSU 
Model has adjudicated that the first is the more likely, thereby 
being both implicitly &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; (since the second chord is deemed 
&ldquo;correct&rdquo;) and factually incorrect (in that it is, in reality, no 
more likely to be found than the second). As <b>Example 4</b> below shows, 
the &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; first chord is the one deliberately chosen by Bach 
himself.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>[18] In the fifth pair of chords offered by Figure 1, the first looks 
decidedly unpromising despite being shown as &ldquo;correct.&rdquo; The chorale 
source is not identified, but there are clearly various possibilities 
for using this configuration in a manner that yields natural voice 
leading. As the Model indicates (&ldquo;incorrectly&rdquo;) by its preference, 
the second chord is a more likely distribution of the notes since 
here it is the root that is doubled rather than the third, and 
(unlike the first chord) the space between alto and tenor is only a 
fourth as opposed to an eleventh. Unsurprisingly, therefore, one does 
not have to look far to find its free use by Bach, as shown below in 
<b>Example 5</b>.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 


</p>
<p>[19] So how did the Model perform overall in these five chorale 
extracts, and what does this say about its value as a tool?

</p>
<p>[20] To be honest, its performance was in my view of only limited 
value: it only &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; identified the first &ldquo;correct&rdquo; chord, 
while it failed for the other four (giving a staggering 80% failure 
rate). But we must not be too harsh for these failings, any more than 
I deserve to be congratulated for having conversely managed for the 
same extracts a success rate of 80% (having managed by pure accident 
to identify four of the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; chords). While the informed (or 
uninformed) judgment of a person can be correlated with that 
person&rsquo;s state of knowledge and experience (or in my case, in this 
instance, sheer luck), a computer&rsquo;s performance is limited only by 
the nature and scope of the data given to it in the first place. We 
know that these data consisted of 2643 four-voice triads, but we do 
not know (and neither can the OSU Model know) upon what basis this 
selection was made. Was it representative, and if so how?

</p>
<p>[21] To provide some idea of scale, let us suppose (for the sake of 
argument only) that on average each chorale consists of (say) four 
phrases, and that each phrase has a minimum of (say) eight chords. 
(This might at least serve as a notional benchmark only.) This should 
mean that within the 371 four-voice chorales found in Riemenschneider 
(alone) there will be (on this basis only) at least 11872 chords. It 
would, in my view, therefore be necessary for the data input to 
contain an absolute minimum of all these 11872 chords, together with 
whatever program instructions are necessary to process the 
information in a meaningful and useful way. The Model&rsquo;s judgment 
that one chord configuration is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than another would then at 
least be the result of a rational statistical evaluation. The results 
currently being generated (as in Figure 1) seem only tangentially 
connected with the broad range of data available, and more to stem 
from certain kinds of evaluative parameters implanted within the 
Model. It is not clear to me exactly how the  2643 sampled chords 
(only) feed into the evaluative process itself.

</p>
<p>[22] Within the language of tonal music, the music is of course not 
the end product of chord spacing. The exact opposite is the case: 
chord spacing is the end product of musical judgment. The difficulty 
with the OSU Model (or indeed any similar model) is that &ldquo;musical 
judgment&rdquo; inhabits a totally different universe from that inhabited 
by &ldquo;computer science.&rdquo; It stands to reason therefore that this Model 
can be of only limited assistance to those who strive to unlock what 
is encoded in the notes left to us by composers such as Bach, Haydn 
and Mozart (indeed any composer living at any time). It might (and 
does) provide evidence of some of the opportunities, and gives 
insight into some of the means. But only when, at a purely human 
level, actual <i>musical judgment</i> is perceptible (and recoverable) 
can the works of these old masters (including their motives) be 
meaningfully understood.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
