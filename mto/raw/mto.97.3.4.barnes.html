<p style="text-align: center"><b>Initial Observations</b></p>
 
<p>&ldquo;Day after day, making tomorrow seem like yesterday. 
 And
remember when we said there was no future?  Well, this is
it.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> </p>



<blockquote>
&ldquo;Humans tend to construct, accept and share with others
systems that explain and organize their world as perceived
and known, and feel uneasy without such explanation and
organization.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
[1] The recently published text, <i>Theories and Analyses of 
Twentieth-Century Music</i> by J. Kent Williams, suggests that, lest we
arrive at the millennium uninformed, the time has arrived to reconcile
with a vengeance the now-fading twentieth-century milieu.  We appear to
be in a period of intense, self-absorbed retrospection.  Blank Reg&rsquo;s
casual paraphrase of nihilistic philosophy in the ill-fated ABC-TV
series &ldquo;Max Headroom&rdquo; signaled that popular media had finally arrived
at the cynical conclusions of Schopenhauer.  We seem more intrigued than
usual with a kind of fascination with relics&mdash;not the truths an icon
represents, but instead an interest in any contemporary, personal, even
scatological, use of the object itself.  Ancient myths and legends have
surfaced as facades for video games and films.  Political figures stand
and wait nervously while we dig up the back yards of their previous
neighborhoods.  A hasty search is on not for an object&rsquo;s true meaning
but for any immediate and personal use that object might afford; in the
absence of any forthcoming evidence as to the object&rsquo;s cultural
significance, a meaning is conveniently attached that serves our
immediate needs.</p>

<p>
[2] The motionless music of New Age puts forward the message that
the predicted age of no momentum has indeed arrived.  And the &ldquo;in
your face&rdquo; Punk defiance reluctantly gave some ground in the late
eighties to the &ldquo;pity me&rdquo; of Grunge and Kurt Cobain, donating its
vulgarities to the underground, where a steady stream of
previously obscene words, disconnected from function, seems to
soothe rather than shock.  This dull stasis has now reached even
Rap, that brash, defiant needle-rocking signal of rage from the
Bronx, giving way to Detroit techno, clean and pressed computer
samples in a post-disco environment run by white boys.  We have
chosen to dilute emotional content in favor of comfort as
background to our numbing search for gratification from the past.</p>

<p>
[3] But anyone scavenging in this cultural boneyard would have
bumped into an academic, there since dawn.  The thriving
intellectual bustle, feeding on Dissanayake&rsquo;s conclusion  about
the human need for organization, depends on the past for its
relics, too; and now more than ever, intellectuals, seeing the
century suddenly closing itself out, are the ones at the
clearance sale.  We rummage with a fever through piles of opinion
and fact, summarizing and encapsulating.  Composers borrow Western
and non-Western sources in their original form freely, a practice
looked upon as heresy in the sixties.  Non-Western ritual and
communal music is disassociated from its cultural heritage to
extract &ldquo;that sound.&rdquo;  Stricken with retro-speak, we hastily
reflect back on a century nearly complete, and feed continually
upon sounds that were perhaps too rich to be digested upon their
inception, searching frantically for clues to their meaning, lest
we find ourselves without the magic keys to the city of the third
millennium.</p>

<p>
[4] Having been raised on a steady academic diet of 
continually
&ldquo;new and better&rdquo; restructuring of the past, I would like to
believe that this frantic last-minute inventory serves an
important function: to look down and feel the firm earth beneath
before we leap. And now that the topic 
&ldquo;twentieth-century music&rdquo;
actually means what it says, theorists and musicologists are
pick-axing in a gold mine of opportunity.  Numerous recent
textbooks on the subject by various theorists include three
salient ones in the last eight years&mdash;texts by Joel Lester,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Joseph N. Straus,<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> and J. Kent 
Williams.  And, at least for
now, the feeling of the earth beneath is indeed comforting.  The
view of this article is not from the center of a circle of
theorists, but instead the perspective of a composer, performer
of contemporary and traditional music, and a teacher of mainly
undergraduate students at liberal-arts colleges and state
universities for the past 25 years.  So let me throw the
vultures in my yard a carcass while I focus for a few
moments on the pedagogical successes and problems I experienced
in the classroom with J. Kent Williams&rsquo;s text, <i>Theories and
Analyses of Twentieth-Century Music</i>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Review</b></p>

<p>
[5] It is not the purpose of this review to argue with what
appear to be small editorial errors that I assume will be
reviewed for a future edition or included as a list of errata.  
I mean instead from a standpoint of personal experience to deal
with the larger pedagogical issues of the text:  success of
practical applications, flow of information, consistency of
design among sections, suitability of examples, and concerns
experienced at the undergraduate level, which may or may not
surface with graduate students.  I chose the Williams text over
the other two mentioned above primarily, but not exclusively,
because of the nature of the course. Several 
talented students
approached me with a request that I teach the course, and
therefore motivation to learn these concepts was high.  These
students had successfully completed two years of undergraduate
theory, and in the four-term process, all chapters of the
Kostka-Payne <i>Tonal Harmony</i> text.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> As I designed it, the new
course had three objectives: 1) to acquaint students with salient
musical examples from the many aesthetic perspectives of this
century; 2) to provide them with tools and drills for practicing
the disassembling&mdash;and, equally important&mdash;reassembling of
examples in a way that would leave the music intact but better
appreciated; and 3) provide them with a resource text that could
be used should they find themselves pursuing at a later date (as
graduate students or professionals) topics that, due to limited
class time, we could not discuss in detail.</p>

<p>[6] So the most important factor in the choice of text, governed
by the realities of undergraduate classes, was inclusiveness.  The
Straus text makes no apologies for being solely pitch-based
theory (with the few additions of multi-serial examples at the
close), focused on atonal music, both serial and non-serial.  The
Lester text does include some other elements&mdash;rhythm, texture,
timbre&mdash;but omits Hindemith neotonal models and has only a
passing mention of Cage and his disciples.</p>

<p>[7] Williams pays a careful homage to nearly every salient
language of this century for which some sort of notation was used
at its inception.  So popular idioms based primarily on oral
tradition do not appear.  Considering how inclusive the text is
otherwise, it is probably for purely practical reasons of space
rather than cultural predisposition that jazz and non-Western
traditional musics are not covered.  The Williams text is divided
into five parts, labeled &ldquo;Pitch Organization: An Introduction,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fundamentals of Set Theory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Other Aspects,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pitch
Organization: A Closer Look,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Recent Developments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[8] The first section shows the author&rsquo;s willingness to balance
tonality, atonality and neotonality by fronting an example of
each for a brief discussion.  The author opens the discussion of
tonal and neotonal music with a concise definition, but I found
the same courtesy curiously missing from the parallel section on
atonal music, jumping instead directly to an example.  I felt my
students were the least comfortable with this music and needed a
brief rationale for its sound.  The summary that follows the
example for each type of organization contains excellent
clarifications, so I asked them diplomatically to &ldquo;read ahead to
find the answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[9] The second section 
introduces students to MIDI and Rahn
numbers<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> as continuous pitch codes, 
and to complete binomial
representation including pitch class, name class and octave, a la
Alexander Brinkman.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Name classes 
are most useful in analysis
of diatonic music, but in this context of set theory and atonal
music they seemed superfluous.  Williams&rsquo;s explanation that name
class is important in enharmonic circumstances is irrelevant to
Part II, since atonal composers and theories tend not to
recognize such distinctions.  The interjection of name classes so
early on, when diatonicism had not yet appeared on the horizon of
analysis, led to a brief information overload in our class.
Exercise 2-7 (page 43) asks the student to list for a melody the
following: pitch (MIDI and Rahn) ordered pitch interval,
unordered pitch interval, pitch class, ordered pc interval,
unordered pc interval, name class, ordered nc interval, unordered
nc interval, MIDI octave, ordered octave interval, and unordered
octave interval.  This conscientious labeling also affects his
discussion of serialism in Part IV, as he insists upon listing
both name classes for any &ldquo;black key&rdquo; note in row boxes, crowding
the page with more information than needed.</p>

<p>
[10] Logically this is done so that information is presented in
the author&rsquo;s &ldquo;spiral organization&rdquo; pattern by introducing concepts up
front and returning in later chapters for greater discussion.  But
in my class it was not until modality is detailed in chapter 10 that a 
student raised her head and said &ldquo;Name classes! Of course!&rdquo; So the
labeling section could lead to pitch-name saturation as the
author&rsquo;s continued inclusion of numerous references demanded that
we constantly refer to a single pitch in the manner of always
calling a child &ldquo;Cynthia Marie Sylvia Alicia Jenkins&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Cindy.&rdquo; This accruing of pitch information is certainly
necessary for advanced work in atonal theory, but again seems in
keeping with our frantic search for clues in this era, by
considering as many horizontal and vertical points of view as
possible&mdash;simultaneously.  Williams does offers brief
explanations as to <i>which</i> musical circumstances might prompt the
choice of one labeling system (or thread of differing systems) to
aid in discovering the meaning of a specific passage.  For
example, the use of relative rather than absolute representation
(page 34) in the Berg &ldquo;Schliesse mir die Augen beide&rdquo; presentation
from an earlier chapter (pages 12&ndash;13) seems logical when F is a
constant starting pitch for each row statement.  But over-labeling
of pitches, perhaps fulfilling the human need for organization
expressed above by Dissenayake, can lead away from what some
believe is the creative power of serialism, which Anton Ehrenzweig 
includes in his discussion of &ldquo;unconscious scanning&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

&ldquo;Schoenberg&rsquo;s or Boulez&rsquo;s critics quite properly complained
that it was impossible by ordinary means of appreciation to
recognize the submerged order of serialization.
Serialization directly attacks all conscious means of
continuity.  These critics missed the essential point that
serialism meant to defeat conscious powers of
appreciation.  Here is a case of the intellect turning
against itself.  Hence the composer and listener have to take
recourse to <i>undifferentiated</i> (italics mine) visualization
which can hold the complex serial structure of the possible
permutations in a single glance.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[11] In Part III, &ldquo;Other Aspects,&rdquo; Williams balances the
preceding saturation of pitch theory by discussing meter, rhythm,
texture, form, process and temporality.  Here the thoroughness of
the author works in our favor, and one is grateful for an
attitude as conscientious with these elements as his approach to
pitch.  Chapter 7, dealing with rhythm, moves from an example of
metric framework in a traditional meter through the various ways
composers mutated or attempted to erase this notion in our
century.  References in the chapter lead us through a generous
sampling of the most important analytical work done on rhythm and
meter in this century.  And in particular, Chapter 9 is one of the
best synopses I have seen of time and process.  Williams balances
the need to find meaningful events and their relationships with a
discussion of &ldquo;process&rdquo;&mdash;in traditional terms, transitions; in
contemporary terms anything from background step-progressions to
an example of nearly pure process, a fifteen-minute glissando
from one vertical sound to another in Kaija Saariaho&rsquo;s <i>Vers le
blanc</i> for electronic tape (page 160).  But, another minor
interruption of the flow, the discussion of &ldquo;moment form&rdquo;
contains an inference as to the meaning of the term but no
definition.  One must look to the chapter summary to find it.</p>

<p>[12] Part IV reinforces the spiral pedagogy above by returning to
pitch organization for a greater discussion.  Here the author
finds room for diatonicism and pentatonicism, symmetrical sets,
neotonality, free atonality and serialism.  In a book with a lot
to swallow to start with, this section is the chewiest.  But as
before, flow charts pose and answer important questions
succinctly, and concise summations place these answers directly
in the student&rsquo;s lap.  Drills designed with specific examples in
mind build one&rsquo;s confidence with abstract principles and tether
them to an actual work, thus allowing the concept to seek
identification in both the general and specific memory.  Boxed
step-by-step summaries of formulas and procedures provide a
reflective breather for most chapters in this section, except the
neotonal chapters 12 and 13, and the subsequent atonal chapter,
the latter finding most of my students the least confident with
the language and therefore in need of such a summary.</p>

<p>[13] A salient pedagogic feature of the chapter on free atonality
is a stage-by-stage analysis of two works&mdash;Piano Piece, Op. 11,
No. 1 by Schoenberg, and Five Pieces for String Quartet, Op. 5,
No. 3 by Webern.  I was most impressed by Williams&rsquo;s ability to
carry the student through each level of understanding, with
helpful suggestions and clues (but not freebies) including,
perhaps most important to beginners, an introduction to parsing a
score into significant sets, establishing segmentation guidelines
based on texture and melodic phrase.  Although experienced
theorists could always argue with the choices made and the logic
involved in the decisions, this kind of active coaching can be an
intensely positive model for independent analytical growth with
students, undergraduate or graduate, entering this world for the
first time.</p>

<p>[14] Part V, &ldquo;Recent Developments,&rdquo; is the section which
&ldquo;provide[s] concise introductions to more recent approaches to
composition&rdquo; (Williams, iii).  Here the author covers chance and
indeterminacy (terms for which he makes a clear distinction)
minimalism, eclecticism, and the revival of tonality.  The author
cites composer prefaces, philosophies and performance notes when
appropriate, and provides a piece-by-piece summary of John Cage&rsquo;s
evolution toward <i>4&rsquo;33&rdquo;</i>, which Williams calls &ldquo;the ultimate
realization of Cage&rsquo;s philosophy&rdquo; (page 302). A flow chart now
appears for phase (process) in Steve Reich&rsquo;s <i>Piano Phase</i>, as
well as examples of how &ldquo;quote music&rdquo; is used in George
Rochberg&rsquo;s <i>Carnival Music IV</i> (comparing the original Bach and
Brahms sources to their use by Rochberg.) But no musical example
of &ldquo;The New Tonality&rdquo; is offered.  This is a language I consider
clearly a more evolved synthesis of current systems, rather than
the use of direct quotations from the past.  So this is the
section of the text that I would hope the author expand in a
subsequent edition.</p>

<p>[15] If another edition is forthcoming, I would 
recommend that
any expansion include a recent example by a non-Western composer.
Sudanese Hamza el Din&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waterwheel,&rdquo; recorded by the Kronos
Quartet is a fine mingling of the ostinato principle on a 
stable sonority with the bending and slurring of melody
tones in the central African vocal tradition.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> <i>Sparrows</i> (1979)
by Joseph Schwantner serves as an example of both &ldquo;the new
tonality&rdquo; (its quintal harmony is used in two chromatic
circle-of-fifth progressions in the first half) and eclecticism
(employing Medieval and Baroque styles alongside serial
techniques). It is one of the batch of works from the seventies
and early eighties to feature his &ldquo;celestial choir&rdquo; trademark.</p>

<p>[16] Having taught the text, then, I can reach the following
summation: 1) it offers a thoroughly objective look at
most current styles, with clear delivery of information; 2) this
inclusiveness in a short text compacts the information, demanding
careful reading of each sentence and slow digestion; 3) most
initial confusion is dispelled by drills, questions for review,
and projects; 4) further confidence on the student&rsquo;s part is
gained by providing charts and projects partially completed with
correct answers; 5) some chapters, especially the opening one and
those on neotonality, would benefit from the same consistent
approach with partially-guided drills.</p>

<p>[17] The outcome of my undergraduate twentieth-century
theory class was that students who in a traditional theory
curricula would not encounter more than a passing look at the
music of their own century gained valuable literacy and specific
tools for study of nearly every current style.  By using the
Williams text they acquired a reference guide for future study.
Quotations from primary and secondary sources are succinct, to
the point, and unencumbered, and suggest directions for many
possibilities of continuing with a particular theory.  Chapter
summaries are clearly-written overviews of the topic&rsquo;s most
critical items.  And Williams&rsquo;s closing of chapters with questions
for review and finite analysis projects is especially welcome.
Similar to the Lester text, these sections provide hands-on
practice, and as the Williams text progresses, provide useful
&ldquo;hints&rdquo; to prompt the reader in one direction to begin an
analysis.  The objective approach, though laudable, leaves a bit
of the author&rsquo;s own personality&mdash;his bias and bliss&mdash;out of the
mix.  But given the breadth of coverage, this is perhaps a
necessary sacrifice in the name of keeping the length under
control.  In a cynical and often self-serving age, the Williams
text offers a refreshing and brave inclusiveness that delivers a
balanced and fair treatment of most of the musical languages of
this century.</p>
