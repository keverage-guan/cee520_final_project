<p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>1. Introduction</b></p>

<p>[1.1]  In view of his well-known belief that 
&ldquo;voice-leading must 
always and everywhere be regarded as the actual foundation 
of music,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> it is instructive to 
learn that, in <i>Counterpoint</i>, Schenker sets as his &ldquo;first task<nobr>. . .</nobr>to draw the 
boundaries 
between the <i>pure theory of voice leading</i> and <i>free 
composition</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Schenker, in 
other words, despite his firm 
commitment to the contrapuntal origins of tonal music, finds it 
necessary to begin his treatise by setting strict counterpoint 
and free composition clearly apart. At one point 
he even goes 
so far as to speak of a &ldquo;great gulf&rdquo; that lies between the two 
domains, somewhat like the gulf that separates the rules of 
grammar from the creative use of language.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p>


[1.2] As Schenker is quick to realize, however, 
&ldquo;precisely such a 
clear-cut discrimination between the &lsquo;exercise&rsquo; and the free 
work of art makes all the more imperative a second task, 
namely<nobr>. . .</nobr> to reveal the <i>connection between counterpoint</i> 
(which may be considered the first musico-grammatical 
exercises)  <i>and the actual work of art</i>&mdash;to show the nature 
and foundation of this connection.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Thus, if strict 
counterpoint and free composition lie at the opposite sides of 
a great divide, there are nonetheless bridges&mdash;bridges to free 
composition&mdash;that take one from one side to the other.
<p>



[1.3] In the present essay I shall question the existence of two 
specific such bridges. In particular, I shall claim that the triad 
and seventh chord of free composition, as harmonic entities, 
are qualitatively distinct from the &ldquo;triad&rdquo; and &ldquo;seventh chord&rdquo; 
of strict counterpoint; the gap between the harmonic and 
contrapuntal meanings of the terms &ldquo;triad&rdquo; and &ldquo;seventh 
chord,&rdquo; in other words, simply cannot be bridged. Schenker is 
of course aware that the seventh chord is a potential problem, 
for he devotes a special section to the &ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh 
chord, as he calls it, in the last part of <i>Counterpoint</i>, a part 
entitled, appropriately enough, &ldquo;Bridges to Free 
Composition.&rdquo; Schenker seems less aware, however, that even 
to derive the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; triad from purely contrapuntal 
assumptions is highly problematic.<p>

[1.4] It should be stressed that not all of 
Schenker&rsquo;s bridges are 
of questionable status; as Schenker insightfully suggests in 
&ldquo;Bridges to Free Composition,&rdquo; combined species may be 
viewed in hierarchical terms.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
Combined species, in other 
words, may be viewed as a bridge between strict counterpoint 
and free composition as far as such notions as &ldquo;structural 
level,&rdquo; &ldquo;prolongation,&rdquo; or the <i>Stufe</i>, are concerned. 
Nonetheless, I believe that the failure of Schenker&rsquo;s bridges in 
the cases of the triad and seventh chord has far-reaching 
theoretical implications. I shall consider these implications in 
an appendix to the present essay.<p><p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>2. The Consonance Principle</b></p>
<p>
[2.1] Contrapuntal theory, for Schenker, may be 
reduced to one 
fundamental premise, reiterated time and again (in one version 
or another) throughout the two volumes of <i>Counterpoint</i>: 
&ldquo;<i>In the beginning is consonance!</i> The consonance is 
primary, the dissonance secondary!&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> I shall refer 
henceforth to this principle as the &ldquo;Consonance Principle&rdquo; 
(CP).<p>

[2.2] How, exactly, does Schenker classify 
vertical dyads as 
consonant and dissonant? As it turns out, Schenker uses more 
than one system of classification. By one method, to which I 
shall refer henceforth as CP1, the consonances are either 
perfect (perfect octave and fifth), or imperfect (major or 
minor third and sixth); all other intervals (augmented fourth, 
diminished fifth, major or minor second or seventh)&mdash;<i>except 
the perfect fourth</i>&mdash;are always dissonant. By CP1 the perfect 
fourth has special status. Originally a perfect consonance, the 
interval becomes a dissonance <i>when formed in relation to 
the bass</i>.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
<p>


[2.3] According to another method, to which I shall refer 
henceforth as CP2, intervals are only counted in relation to 
the bass. The perfect fourth, by CP2, is dissonant. However, 
since intervals in the upper parts are in a sense nonexistent, it 
is irrelevant whether they are consonant or dissonant. Thus, 
the intervals perfect fourth, augmented fourth, diminished 
fifth, major or minor second or seventh, may be freely used in 
the upper parts <i>as if they were consonant</i>.  
It should be 
stressed that Schenker never explicitly distinguishes between 
CP1 and CP2. For example, after explaining that 
the perfect 
fourth &ldquo;realizes its original potential as a consonance&rdquo; when 
formed in the upper parts (CP1), he mentions as an 
afterthought that a similar allowance must be made for the 
augmented fourth as well, even though the interval was never 
&ldquo;originally&rdquo; a consonance (CP2).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> There is some evidence 
in <i>Counterpoint</i> that CP2 is Schenker&rsquo;s preferred system of 
consonance/dissonance classification;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> and yet, in deriving 
the triad in volume 2, Schenker seems to be using CP1 and CP2 
interchangeably.


<p style="text-align: center"><b>3. The Triad in Strict Counterpoint</b></p>

<p>
[3.1] In his discussion of three-voice 
counterpoint, first species, 
Schenker states that &ldquo;to the extent that the three 
[simultaneous-sounding] tones of the counterpoint are to be 
of different pitch, the law of consonance itself (cf. Part 2, 
Chapter 1) restricts polyphony of three voices to <nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> or <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>. 
The concept of triad thus evolved in the vertical dimension of 
three-voice counterpoint, <i>simply through the law of 
consonance first handed down by the voice leading of 
two-voice counterpoint</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
Clearly, the &ldquo;law of 
consonance&rdquo; to which Schenker refers is CP1, since by CP2 
the <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority is allowed in addition to <nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> and <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>.<p>


<p>
[3.2] Schenker begins the subsequent section with 
the following 
statement: &ldquo;Since the concept of triad was thus restricted, for 
the domain of three-voice counterpoint, to <nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> and <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, <i>the 
necessity of rejecting the sonority <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr></i> followed as a natural 
consequence, although both of its intervals are consonant with 
the bass.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
Clearly, in the first part of this statement 
Schenker continues to assume CP1; however, in the second 
part he tacitly switches to CP2. For only by CP2 there exists a 
<i>necessity</i> of &ldquo;rejecting&rdquo; the sonority <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>; indeed, only by 
CP2 does the consonance of the fifth and sixth <i>in relation to 
the bass</i> take priority over the dissonance that the upper 
tones of these intervals form among themselves. That 
Schenker tacitly replaced CP1 by CP2 becomes clear in his 
discussion of the diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority a few paragraphs 
later (clearly, the diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority is excluded by CP1): 
&ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> in the case of the <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> the diminished fifth or augmented 
fourth is permitted in the inner voices<nobr>. . .</nobr> For through these 
positions, those intervals become thirds and sixths &lt;in relation 
to the bass&gt;, which, as such, <i>now adequately satisfy the law 
of consonance</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> <p>

[3.3] Schenker&rsquo;s contrapuntal derivation of the 
triad is 
problematic on several counts. First, although he seems to 
settle for CP2 in the end, his vacillation between CP1 and CP2 
is plainly unacceptable. Second, as a &ldquo;law of consonance,&rdquo; 
CP2 leaves much to be desired. While it is true that, say, 
(d1,f1,b1) sounds much better than (b,d1,f1), it is nonetheless 
rather doubtful that one could count the diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> 
among the consonant sonorities.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
Moreover, since CP2 
allows the diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, it must also allow the <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> (unless 
the fifth happens to be diminished, as in the dominant <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>). 
 This requires an additional, <i>ad hoc</i> rule by 
which to exclude 
the <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> from the domain of &ldquo;triads.&rdquo; &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> Purely contrapuntal 
experience&rdquo; Schenker explains, &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> has taught that the triad 
as such can be bounded by either 5 or 6, but not with both of 
these intervals at the same time.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 

<p>


[3.4] Although each of the above objections is quite serious, a 
much more sweeping objection may be made with regard to 
deriving the notion &ldquo;triad&rdquo; from contrapuntal assumptions in 
general, be they CP1, CP2, or any other conceivable 
&ldquo;Consonance Principle.&rdquo; For the triad of free composition is 
defined <i>independently</i> of the quality of the intervals of 
which it is comprised (major, minor, etc.), so that, for 
example, not only are (C,E,G) and (C,<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>,G) defined as triads, 
but also are (C,<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>,<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) and (C,E,<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>) so defined. In deriving 
the triad of free composition, in other words, the Consonance 
Principle is simply irrelevant.

<p>

[3.5]  Note that what is at stake here is not merely that strict 
counterpoint excludes the diminished and augmented 
sonorities from the domain of &ldquo;triads&rdquo; (altogether by CP1, in 
root position as well as second inversion by CP2); after all, 
one might argue, of the seven diatonic triads only one is 
diminished, and none is augmented (the augmented triad may 
arise only as a result of chromatic alteration). Rather, what is 
at stake is a much more fundamental issue, namely, that the 
triad of free composition, in principle, cannot be equated with 
the &ldquo;triad&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;consonant three-tone sonority&rdquo;) of strict 
counterpoint. There exists, in other words, a <i>qualitative 
difference</i> between the two concepts, <i>regardless of how 
often specific manifestations of either may happen to 
coincide in practice</i>. Even by CP2, which allows the 
diminished as well as augmented <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonorities, the gap 
between the &ldquo;triad&rdquo; of strict counterpoint and the triad of free 
composition simply cannot be bridged. To be sure, one can 
&ldquo;invert&rdquo; a diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> to its root-position form; yet this 
inversion cannot be a &ldquo;triad&rdquo; by CP2. Only a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; 
definition of &ldquo;triad&rdquo;&mdash;one where intervallic quality does not 
count&mdash;can sanction the &ldquo;triadhood&rdquo; of the diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>. But 
such a definition, once again, is qualitatively distinct from a 
definition based on CP.
<p>

[3.6] It is instructive that Schenker does refer 
to the 
diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority as a &ldquo;triad,&rdquo; even though the sonority 
violates both CP1 and CP2.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
Schenker&rsquo;s terminological 
inconsistency ultimately leads to the following obscure 
statement: &ldquo;Thus in the final analysis it is 
merely the absence 
of scale degrees that prevents the diminished triad in strict 
three-voice counterpoint from being included in the category 
of triads that are consonant or to be treated as consonant.&rdquo; 
Now, taken at face value this statement makes hardly any 
sense, for the only &ldquo;triads&rdquo; that exist in strict counterpoint are 
consonant, by definition.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
Perhaps, however, Schenker 
intended something like the following statement: &ldquo;Unlike free 
composition, where the diminished <i>sonority</i> may assume 
(together with the six consonant triads) the role of a scale 
degree, the sonority in strict three-voice counterpoint (at least 
in root position) is prevented from being included in the 
category of triads because it is dissonant.&rdquo; But this statement 
is simply another way of saying that a qualitative, 
unbridgeable difference exists between the &ldquo;triad&rdquo; of strict 
counterpoint and the triad of free composition; for to say that 
a given sonority, in free composition, is a &ldquo;scale degree,&rdquo; 
presumably implies that this sonority is a triad.


<p style="text-align: center"><b>4. The Seventh Chord in Strict Counterpoint</b></p>

<p>
[4.1] Unlike the major and minor triads, any 
root-position 
seventh chord violates CP, and thus has no independent status 
in strict counterpoint.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
Schenker, therefore, explicitly 
relegates the discussion of the seventh chord to the 
concluding part of his treatise, a part that he designates by the 
highly suggestive title &ldquo;Bridges to Free Composition.&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Bridges,&rdquo; as is well known, is an essay on combined species. 
The &ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord, as Schenker calls it, is 
considered in the context of three-voice counterpoint, 
combining fourth-species counterpoint (suspensions) with 
second species.
<p>

[4.2] It is not difficult to see why Schenker opted to derive his 
&ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord from a combination that specifically 
includes a fourth-species part (rather than, say, a combination 
of two second-species parts). The treatment of the seventh in 
fourth-species counterpoint is suggestive of free composition 
on two important counts: (1) the seventh resolves 
downwards; (2) the seventh appears on the downbeat, and 
thus seems to have a more independent status than, say, a 
passing seventh on the weak beat. The first of these two 
considerations is not really relevant to the present discussion, 
which focuses on the conceptual status of the seventh chord 
as a vertical formation, and not on how a seventh chord may 
or may not interact with its neighboring harmonies.
 <p>


[4.3] It is important to emphasize how crucial 
for Schenker in 
this context is the distinction between a suspended seventh on 
the strong beat and a passing seventh on a weak beat. Thus 
for example, in connection with the suspended <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> 
combination (a combination that he finds difficult to explain in 
terms of a fourth-species model), Schenker states that the tied 
&ldquo;fifth, born as a seventh, falls under the concept of passing 
tone, in spite of the fact that just in this combination-type it 
creates, by means of tying, the <i>impression</i> of a suspension. . 
.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> In other words, even if, at a 
foreground level, a 
passing motion has the appearance of a suspension formation 
as a result of contraction, this formation is not be confused 
with a true suspension.  That Schenker insists on 
explaining his 
&ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord in terms of a fourth-species model is 
a point worth remembering. In fact, Schenker is obsessed with 
the suspension-idea in this context to such an extraordinary 
extent that he seems to forget that in the earlier parts of his 
treatise he practically obliterated the distinction between 
passing motion and suspension, by accounting for the 
dissonant suspension of fourth species precisely in the terms 
of contracted passing motion.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> <p>

[4.4] Since Schenker insists that his &ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord is 
a child of fourth-species counterpoint, we might as well take a 
look at Fux&rsquo;s <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i> to review the special 
problems of dissonance treatment that this species poses. In 
Fux&rsquo;s treatise, there is no separate treatment of combined 
species; yet the treatise does include some suggestive 
references to dissonance treatment in the context of fourth 
species combined with second species. Before turning to these 
specific references, however, let us listen to Fux on fourth 
species in ordinary two- and three-part counterpoint.<p>

[4.5] Concerning the status of dissonance in 
fourth-species 
counterpoint, Fux&rsquo;s rule is straightforward: &ldquo;ligatures do not 
change anything.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> In other 
words, the dissonance, 
 <i>despite its appearance on the downbeat</i>, has no 
independent status; only the consonance to which the 
dissonance resolves has independent status.  It 
is therefore 
conceptually possible to disregard the dissonance altogether, 
as though the consonance occupied the entire measure in the 
manner of a first-species exercise. Fux 
illustrates the idea that 
first species conceptually underlies fourth species&mdash;at least as 
far as the status of consonance is concerned&mdash;in both the two- and three-part contexts.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Fux&rsquo;s 
examples&mdash;given here as 
<b>Figures 1a</b> and <b>1b</b>&mdash;are quoted by Schenker.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
<p>
[4.6]  Fux reiterates the rule that &ldquo;as to the 
consonances, <nobr>. . .</nobr> 
[the ligature, as a delaying of the note following] does not 
alter anything,&rdquo; in the four-part context as well.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
However, apparently for purely practical reasons (writing four 
obbligato parts can be difficult at times), he relaxes the rule 
somewhat. The seemingly innocent move turns out to be 
highly problematic. Here is the relevant part of the discussion:
<p>

<blockquote>
<i>Joseph</i>.&mdash; Does this rule always hold, revered master?<br>
<i>Aloys</i>.&mdash;It does not hold in some instances of this species in 
which the ligatures must sound well together with three whole 
notes for the duration of a full measure. The commonest 
instance in which this cannot be brought about is when the 
seventh is used together with the fifth in the ligature, e.g.: [see 
<b>Figure 2a</b>] <i>If the ligature were removed, a dissonance with the 
tenor would result which is faulty and decidedly to be 
avoided</i>.<br>
<i>Joseph</i>.&mdash;What can one do in this case?<br>
<i>Aloys</i>.&mdash;One must divide the whole note in the tenor part, 
thus: [see <b>Figure 2b</b>]<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup><br>

<p>
[4.7] Now, it is pretty obvious that Aloys&rsquo;s 
solution to the 
conceptual downbeat-dissonance (a ninth a&ndash;b1) between the 
tenor and soprano, namely, a momentary combination of 
fourth species with second species, is no solution at all, since 
the conceptual dissonance prevails despite the movement in 
the tenor, as <b>Figure 2c</b> makes abundantly clear.  In his treatise, 
Schenker quotes this passage from Fux without comment.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup><p>

[4.8] At the same time, Schenker launches a 
scathing attack 
on Fux in connection with a related passage appearing only a 
few pages later. According to Schenker, in this second 
passage (to which I shall turn shortly) Fux&rsquo;s &ldquo;lack of a clearly 
defined insight<nobr>. . .</nobr> &lt;causes him&gt; to become bound up with 
such unfortunate contradictions or otherwise confused ideas 
as we have just been able to witness.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Schenker is quite 
clear as to where exactly Fux&rsquo;s ineptitude lies: &ldquo;All of Fux&rsquo;s 
errors, including the incorrect construal of the topic of 
subdivision, the poor choice of placement, and finally the 
confusing treatment with its amalgamation of incommensurate 
concepts, may arise from his inadequate insight into <i>the 
nature of the seventh-chord in general</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> The seventh 
chord. Is it possible that Schenker sensed that a 
serious threat 
to his &ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord was lurking in Fux&rsquo;s 
discussion? Let us consider the most revealing portion of the 
passage in question, where Fux refers to one of his examples 
of fourth species in simple four-part counterpoint; Fux&rsquo;s 
example is given here as <b>Figure 3a</b>.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
<p>

[4.9] Note that in two instances&mdash;measure 3 and measure 5&mdash;Fux violates 
the purity of the species by introducing half-note motion in the 
top voice. Significantly, however, unlike the half-note motion 
in Figure 2b, these motions are fully compatible with the rule 
that &ldquo;ligatures do not change anything&rdquo;; as shown in <b>Figure 3b</b>, 
the removal of the suspended tone in favor of its resolution 
reveals two completely consonant configurations, 6&ndash;5 and 5&ndash;6. 
At the same time, it seems that Fux could have hardly resisted 
noting that the vertical combination in the first half of measure 5 
corresponds to an incomplete seventh chord in third inversion. 
As Aloys explains, &ldquo;in the fifth measure of the last example 
the second is doubled while the sixth which is required for an 
<i>absolutely perfect harmony</i> is missing&mdash;as the following 
example shows: [see <b>Figure 3c</b>].&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup><p>
[4.10] Now, Schenker is of course correct in 
criticizing Fux for 
referring to a seventh chord as &ldquo;an absolutely perfect 
harmony&rdquo; in the context of strict counterpoint;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> and yet, if 
Fux indeed believed that an inner-voice D on the downbeat of 
measure 5 would have been so advantageous, what could have 
possibly prevented him from having it in his example in the 
first place? Surely not the purity of the species.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> Schenker 
may have found Fux&rsquo;s passage to be so disturbing precisely 
because it seems to force a choice between two incompatible 
alternatives: either a seventh chord is a &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; in its own 
right, in which case the Consonance Principle must be 
abandoned, or else the seventh chord cannot exist as such in 
strict counterpoint, even in combined species.


<p>
[4.11]  This brings us, finally, to Schenker&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh 
chord. As William Clark correctly observes, Schenker&rsquo;s 
distinction between two types of suspensions, only one of 
which is &ldquo;authentic,&rdquo; is crucial in this connection.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> The 
syncopes 7&ndash;6 (upper part), as well as 2&ndash;3 and 4&ndash;5 (lower part), 
cannot be considered authentic according to Schenker, 
because they &ldquo;raise doubt about whether the harmony of the 
downbeat still continues at the third (final) time-unit or 
whether, because of the interval 6 in the upper (or 3 or 5 in 
the lower) counterpoint, a second harmony should not 
perhaps be assumed.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> <p>

[4.12]  This statement, however, deserves close scrutiny. Given 
a suspension such as 7&ndash;6 in the upper part, what could 
possibly raise doubt as to the identity of the harmony on the 
weak beat? By CP, the seventh has no independent status, and 
therefore the interval of the sixth conceptually underlies the 
entire measure. Since the interval of the sixth, in strict 
counterpoint, can be associated with only one &ldquo;harmony,&rdquo; 
namely a (consonant) <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority, there can be no other 
harmony in this measure in the first place. In other words, 
there is no question here at all of assuming &ldquo;a second 
harmony&rdquo; on the upbeat, as Schenker would have us believe. 
Quite to the contrary. Only if one assumed, <i>in violation of 
the rules of fourth-species counterpoint</i>, that a &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; 
<i>other</i> than a <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> sonority is present on the <i>downbeat</i>, is 
a 
change of harmony within the measure at all conceivable.
<p>

[4.13]  Since the traditional rules of strict counterpoint no longer 
seem to apply, the identity of Schenker&rsquo;s downbeat harmony is 
anybody&rsquo;s guess. Nonetheless, it is fairly clear that the 
downbeat harmony cannot contain the sixth of the weak beat, 
since Schenker sees precisely this sixth as the principal agent 
of harmonic change. But this means that the <i>seventh of the 
downbeat must be counted as an essential component of the 
assumed harmony</i>. That is to say, the seventh must be 
considered an essential dissonance.<p>

[4.14]  It thus turns out (not quite 
surprisingly, I would 
maintain) that Schenker&rsquo;s distinction between the two types of 
suspensions is but a thinly-disguised version of Kirnberger&rsquo;s 
(and/or Schulz&rsquo;s) epoch-making distinction between 
&ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; and &ldquo;essential&rdquo; dissonance.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> Kirnberger&rsquo;s 
distinction is epoch-making precisely because it implies that 
the seventh chord of free composition is a 
qualitatively-different entity from the suspended-seventh 
formations of fourth-species counterpoint. The seventh chord 
of free composition, in other words, must be assumed as a 
harmonic entity in its own right. For Schenker, to openly 
admit that the seventh chord embodied an essential dissonance 
is of course out of the question, for such an admission would 
fly in the face of CP. This ambivalence results in some of the 
most outrageously self-contradictory prose ever committed to 
paper by a music theorist.
<p>
[4.15]  Consider, for example, the following 
sequence of ideas, 
which appear in close succession in the opening paragraph of 
&ldquo;The budding seventh-chord.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> <p>

(1) &ldquo;If we now place the syncopes &lt;previously&gt; described<nobr>. . .</nobr> 
in a row<nobr>. . .</nobr> , we easily recognize chords therein which sound 
the same as the seventh-chord of free composition or its 
inversions.&rdquo;<p>

(2) &ldquo;The seventh-chord &lt;of free composition&gt;<nobr>. . .</nobr> is 
completely distinct from a suspension-formation<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;<p>

(3) &ldquo;The so-called seventh-chord &lt;of free composition&gt;<nobr>. . .</nobr> 
represents nothing but a triad in which, by means of 
abbreviation, the passing tone of the seventh appears to be 
incorporated as a chord member.&rdquo;<p>

(4) &ldquo;(The passing tone, however, relinquishes nothing of its 
independence &lt;<i>sic!</i>&gt; through the fact that it moves forward 
to another, no less independent, sound.)&rdquo;<p>

(5) &ldquo;Nevertheless, there is certainly still a considerable 
difference between the seventh-chord of free composition and 
the syncope-settings named above.&rdquo;<p>

Now, the only possible sense that one might make of this wild 
collection of ideas is something like the following statement: 
&ldquo;Despite its superficial resemblance to the 
suspension-formations of strict counterpoint, the seventh 
chord of free composition [idea no. 1] is not a suspension 
formation at all [ideas no. 2 and 5]; rather, the seventh chord 
of free composition is a passing-tone formation [idea no. 3], 
however, a passing-tone formation of a very special type, 
unfamiliar to strict counterpoint [idea no. 4].&rdquo; But clearly, if 
this is really what is meant (especially with regard to the 
amazing <i>parenthetical</i> reference to the alleged 
independence of the passing tone), then Schenker&rsquo;s prose is 
simply a highly convoluted way of saying that the seventh 
chord of free composition is qualitatively distinct from the 
quasi seventh-chord formations (whether of fourth species or 
second-species origin) of strict counterpoint. The &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; 
between strict counterpoint and free composition simply does 
not exist.<p>

[4.16]  Or consider the following statement, 
where Schenker, in 
trying to account for the suspended <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> formation (which, as 
he acknowledges, &ldquo;distances itself the farthest from strict 
counterpoint&rdquo;), states that &ldquo;the tied fifth of this chord 
represents <i>that authentic seventh</i> which free composition 
has learned to derive by means of abbreviation of an 8&ndash;7 
passing motion and to incorporate into the triad.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup>  Now, 
the reference to &ldquo;that authentic seventh&rdquo; would seem to 
concede that the seventh chord of free composition is 
qualitatively different from the suspension formations of strict 
counterpoint. Schenker, apparently realizing the far-reaching 
implications of this reference, quickly explains away &ldquo;that 
authentic seventh&rdquo; as a mere passing tone rhythmically 
displaced (an idea anticipated in the statements quoted 
above). But if, indeed, the authentic seventh of free 
composition is &ldquo;nothing but&rdquo; contracted passing motion, why 
bother with a fourth-species model in the first place? And yet 
Schenker insists, as has been already pointed out, in using a 
fourth-species model in this case rather than a second-species 
one.
<p>

[4.17]  A natural reaction to Schenker&rsquo;s 
hopelessly confused 
account of the &ldquo;budding&rdquo; seventh chord&mdash;especially by 
someone who is not particularly sympathetic to his ideas in 
the first place&mdash;would be to give him a good taste of the 
arrogant and condescending attitude that he repeatedly 
expressed towards his fellow theorists. After all, was it not 
Schenker himself, at the very outset of <i>Counterpoint</i>, who 
ridiculed his colleagues (especially, Rameau and Riemann) by 
comparing them to children playing with dolls?<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> Yet what 
can be more childish than Schenker&rsquo;s make-believe world 
where blatant contradictions do not seem to count?<p>

[4.18]  Nonetheless, I believe that such a reaction, although not 
totally unjustified, would miss the point. What it fails to take 
into account is the extraordinary finding that Schenker clings 
to the fourth-species model even though he seems to know 
perfectly well (as the excerpts quoted above strongly suggest) 
that a second-species model, combined with the simple notion 
of contraction, could have saved him a lot of trouble. What 
could be the possible reason for Schenker&rsquo;s self-defeating 
stubbornness in this case?<p>

[4.19]  I believe that in light of all the available evidence, there 
can be only one convincing answer to this question. Schenker 
was genuinely torn between his commitment to the 
Consonance Principle, on the one hand, and his awareness, on 
the other, that the seventh chord of free composition 
embodied an essential dissonance, a dissonance which, in 
good faith, simply cannot be explained in the terms of 
contracted passing motion. Schenker&rsquo;s convoluted prose, 
therefore, is the product of a tormented mind. One can only 
nod one&rsquo;s head in sympathy when Schenker, in the very same 
paragraph from &ldquo;The budding seventh-chord&rdquo; where he refers 
to &ldquo;that authentic seventh,&rdquo; stamps his foot and reasserts the 
premise upon which his entire treatise is based: &ldquo;Thus I repeat 
once more: In the beginning is consonance! It is consonance 
alone that carries within itself the fundamental laws of 
suspensions!&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> Indeed, I believe that the conflict between 
the authentic seventh and the Consonance Principle is one that 
Schenker was never able to resolve. As is well known, in 
<i>Free Composition</i> Schenker rules out <i>a priori</i> a 
composing-out of &ldquo;the dissonant passing tone, including the 
passing seventh&rdquo;; yet just a few pages later he discusses 
examples that &ldquo;show the composing-out of a seventh 
chord.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> <p>

[4.20]  I take it as a tribute to Schenker&rsquo;s 
intellectual integrity 
that, at least in <i>Free Composition</i>, he made little effort to 
smooth-out the contradiction. It is therefore most unfortunate 
that some of his followers have attempted to do just that. 
William Clark, in particular, explains some of Schenker&rsquo;s 
seventh-chord prolongations in terms of implied 8&ndash;7 passing 
motion;<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> where this explanation 
seems to fail, Clark 
concedes that &ldquo;the seventh chord<nobr>. . .</nobr> emerges as an exception 
to this principle [of the consonance of the primary tone].&rdquo; 
Nonetheless, he insists that &ldquo;this exception is not simply an 
<i>ad hoc</i> contrivance appended to Schenker&rsquo;s theory at the 
last moment, as it were<nobr>. . .</nobr>  Rather, this exception is based on 
the unique nature of the seventh chord as revealed in the study 
of combined species&mdash;on the apodictic requirement that the 
elaboration of a <i>seventh-chord suspension</i> must take place 
within the harmony which contains the dissonance.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> It is 
not difficult to see, however, that the seventh chord, the 
&ldquo;unique nature&rdquo; of which the study of combined species is 
presumed to reveal, is simply <i>assumed</i> in the premises of 
combined species in the first place (note the expression 
&ldquo;seventh-chord suspension&rdquo; in Clark&rsquo;s statement, and compare 
with Fux&rsquo;s reference to a seventh chord as an &ldquo;absolutely 
perfect harmony&rdquo;); indeed, Clark&rsquo;s naivet&eacute; directly reflects 
Schenker&rsquo;s erroneous notion that a change of harmony is 
possible within a 7&ndash;6 suspension in strict counterpoint.<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>5. Conclusion</b></p>
<p>
[5.1] I began the present essay by referring to the two goals 
that Schenker sets forth at the outset of <i>Counterpoint</i>: first 
to separate the study of counterpoint from composition, and 
only then to reveal their connection. There can be little doubt 
that Schenker was highly successful as far as the first goal is 
concerned. However, I believe his success in achieving the 
second goal must be seriously reassessed. Schenker believed 
that the &ldquo;great gulf&rdquo; between strict counterpoint and free 
composition may be bridged. Yet at least in two important 
cases&mdash;the triad and seventh chord&mdash;this belief does not seem 
to hold under scrutiny. Contrapuntal theory, by definition, 
simply cannot escape the constraints of the Consonance 
Principle, however ingenious the maneuvers one may devise 
to do so. It is high time to face this fact courageously and to 
draw the necessary conclusions from it. For surely there exist 
alternatives to Schenker&rsquo;s contrapuntally-based theory of 
tonality, a theory of bridges that never were.


<p style="text-align: center"><b>6. Appendix: Beyond the Harmony/Voice-Leading Dichotomy</b></p>

<p>
I. Verticalism and Horizontalism<p>
[6.1]  In <i>Trait&eacute; de l&rsquo;harmonie</i>, Rameau 
states that &ldquo;melody 
is only a consequence of harmony.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> For Schenker, on the other hand, as Carl Schachter has stated, &ldquo;counterpoint is logically prior to harmony and not the other way 
around.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> Schenker expressed this 
dependency very 
clearly in the Preface to <i>Kontrapunkt</i>, although he 
emphasized its historical, rather than conceptual, aspect: &ldquo;All 
musical technique is derived from two basic ingredients: voice 
leading and the progression of scale degrees. Of the two, 
<i>voice leading</i> is the earlier and more original element.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> I shall refer to these two opposing views concerning the 
relative priority in tonal theory of harmony versus 
counterpoint as &ldquo;verticalism&rdquo; (harmony before counterpoint) 
and &ldquo;horizontalism&rdquo; (counterpoint before harmony).
<p>

[6.2]  If &ldquo;triad&rdquo; and &ldquo;seventh chord,&rdquo; as asserted in the 
preceding essay, cannot be defined in contrapuntal terms, 
counterpoint simply cannot be logically prior to harmony. This 
conclusion, however, raises at once a number of questions. 
First, if horizontalism is indeed so fatally flawed, why do 
Schenker&rsquo;s horizontalist views seem so compelling 
nonetheless? And second, what are the theoretical 
consequences of abandoning such views? In particular, does 
abandoning horizontalism necessarily mean that one must 
subscribe to the rival, verticalist approach instead? Such 
questions are taken up below.<p>

II. Horizontalism and Hierarchical Structure
<p>
[6.3]  It is instructive that commentators on 
<i>Counterpoint</i>, 
and especially on &ldquo;Bridges,&rdquo; have tended to accept Schenker&rsquo;s 
contrapuntal derivation of the triad and seventh chord 
uncritically, and focused instead on the hierarchical 
implications of combined species.<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup>  As Schenker pointed out, combined species is extremely suggestive as far as 
hierarchy is concerned, for &ldquo;when several passing tones occur 
simultaneously, they join together in a kind of obbligato 
two-voice setting&mdash;that is, for the sake of their own 
clarification, they cultivate the consonance as the law of their 
relationship<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup> In other 
words, in setting two or more 
second-species parts against a cantus firmus, the Consonance 
Principle applies at two distinct structural levels. At the higher 
level a counterpoint may dissonate against the cantus firmus 
according to the rules of second species, while at a lower level 
the counterpoints form, among themselves, consonant 
relationships in the manner of first species.</p>

<p>
[6.4]  There can be little doubt that Schenker&rsquo;s 
hierarchical 
conception of combined species is an extremely valuable 
contribution to contrapuntal theory,<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> and that the notion 
of tonal hierarchy, in itself, is profound. What cannot be 
accepted, however, is the implication that tonal hierarchy, in 
general, is conceivable <i>only</i> in contrapuntal terms. When 
Carl Schachter, for example, states in connection with his 
combined-species model of Chopin&rsquo;s E-minor Prelude that 
&ldquo;the Prelude is notoriously resistant to a chord-by-chord 
&lsquo;harmonic&rsquo; analysis,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> I take it 
that the emphasis is on 
&ldquo;chord-by-chord&rdquo;&mdash;a primitive, uni-leveled harmonic analysis. 
John Rothgeb is even more straightforward in this respect.  In 
connection with a passage from Mozart&rsquo;s G-minor Symphony, 
given here in reduced score (strings only) as <b>Example 1</b>, Rothgeb 
not only states that &ldquo;the chords in bars 28&ndash;33 are in no way 
intended to express a harmonic progression,&rdquo; but goes so far 
as to imply that it is wrong to regard &ldquo;those passing 
sonorities&rdquo; as triads.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup><p>


<p>
[6.5]  However, there already exists a 
theory&mdash;&ldquo;functional 
<i>Auskomponierung</i>&rdquo;&mdash;where hierarchy is conceived in 
exclusively functional-harmonic terms.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup>  Let me briefly 
demonstrate how such a theory might deal with &ldquo;those passing 
sonorities&rdquo; of Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup>  


<p>
[6.6]  <b>Figure 4a</b> presents one possible analysis. The I <i>Stufe</i> that 
underlies the entire passage is prolonged at a lower level by 
means of a plagal progression I&ndash;IV&ndash;I (T&ndash;S&ndash;T). This plagal 
progression is elaborated at a still lower level by means of two 
different authentic progressions. The opening I is elaborated 
by means of an incomplete authentic progression T&ndash;D (cf. 
Salzer&rsquo;s &ldquo;backward-relating&rdquo; dominant). The IV, on the other 
hand, is prolonged by means of a complete authentic 
progression T&ndash;D&ndash;T; however, the final tonic is represented by 
II, not IV (cf. I&ndash;V&ndash;VI).<p>

[6.7]  Another, possibly more interesting 
analysis is given in 
<b>Figure 4b</b>. Applying the notion that II is weakly dominant,<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup>  
the figure shows a T&ndash;S&ndash;D&ndash;T progression at the intermediate 
level. <b>Example 2</b> shows the statement of this passage 
in G minor in 
the recapitulation. Note that the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> on the last beat of measure 215 
(a full quarter-note in the woodwinds&mdash;refer to the complete 
score) transforms the II<sup>6</sup> chord into a diminished <nobr>VII<img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>.<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> <p>
III. Tonal Theory: A Non-Horizontalist View<p>

[6.8] If strict counterpoint cannot account for triads and 
seventh chords, and moreover there exists no necessary 
connection between counterpoint and hierarchy, it is clearly 
pointless to hold on to a horizontalist view of tonality. But 
once horizontalism is abandoned and the seventh chord is 
accepted as a harmonic entity in its own right, the Consonance 
Principle (CP) must also be abandoned; and it also seems that 
there is no other choice but to subscribe to the rival, verticalist 
view where harmony is seen as conceptually prior to 
counterpoint. These two consequences (or apparent 
consequences) of adopting a non-horizontalist viewpoint shall 
be examined in the present section. <p>

[6.9]  What are the theoretical consequences of 
accepting the 
seventh chord, in violation of CP, as a harmonic entity in its 
own right? William Clark believes (following Schenker) that 
such a move would mean &ldquo;the breakdown of the distinction 
between consonance and dissonance, which in turn implies the 
passing of the old harmonic order&mdash;the tonal system upon 
which the music of the masters of the past was based.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup>  
Clark does not seem to realize that, following the same logic, 
even to admit the plain triad as a harmonic entity would entail 
such theoretically disastrous consequences, at least insofar as 
the diminished triad (and arguably also the augmented triad) is 
regarded as a harmonic entity. In any event, it is clear that 
Clark&rsquo;s concern is justified only if the set of consonant 
intervals is taken as the total intervallic content of one&rsquo;s 
harmonic entities (for example, if one recognizes as harmonic 
entities only the major and minor triads, then the consonant 
intervals would be the perfect prime, fourth, and fifth, as well 
as the major and minor third and sixth).<p>

[6.10]  But there is absolutely no reason to 
define &ldquo;consonance&rdquo; 
in just this particular way. A possible alternative is to take as 
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; consonances those intervals whose special structural 
status must be assumed in defining the notion &ldquo;diatonic 
system&rdquo;: the perfect octave as the agent of &ldquo;octave 
equivalence,&rdquo; and the perfect fifth (or fourth) as the system&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;cyclic generator.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> Thirds and sixths assume special 
status (also as cyclic generators) at a lower level, a level 
where the notion &ldquo;harmonic entity&rdquo; (ultimately, the triad and 
seventh chord) is defined;<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup>   
hence the &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; 
consonances. &ldquo;Consonant interval&rdquo; defined in this way is 
<i>not</i> identical to the total intervallic content of all (diatonic) 
triads and seventh chords.<p>

[6.11]   One notable consequence of adopting such 
an approach 
is that verticalism is no longer the only viable alternative to 
horizontalism. For the notions &ldquo;triad&rdquo; and &ldquo;seventh chord&rdquo; are 
derived from assumptions that include <i>both</i> a harmonic 
<i>and a voice-leading </i>component.<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> In the conceptual rivalry between the vertical and the horizontal, in 
other words, 
neither dimension is necessarily prior to the other; both 
dimensions may be conceived  <i>simultaneously</i>, so that it 
ultimately becomes impossible to refer to one without 
implying the other.

<p>
 [6.12]  Thus, in the final analysis, the perennial 
harmony/voice-leading dichotomy is revealed false. Perhaps 
this is a case worth remembering. For often it is much easier 
to fuel the flames of controversy than to attempt to break its 
vicious circles loose.</p>

necessarily 
concur with his apparent preference for CP2. In &ldquo;Strict Counterpoint 
and 
Tonal Theory,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 19:2 (1975), 282, John 
Rothgeb prefers &ldquo;to stand by the postulate that intervals are measured

</i> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969), 28, Felix Salzer and Carl Schachter

be 
regarded as absolute rather than as a verticalization of a passing

[&lt;d1,a1,b1&gt;, or &lt;d1,b1,a2&gt;] there exists no dissonance with respect to 
the lowest voice. Nevertheless the chord is a dissonance and must be

classifying 
the 
perfect fourth as a dissonance (page 112), subsequently he states that 
the 
interval may realize &ldquo;its original potential as a consonance&rdquo; (page 113). 
As 
the discussion on page 114 makes clear, the fourth reverts to its 
original 
consonant status when formed in the upper parts.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Counterpoint</i>, vol. 1, 114.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">See especially Schenker&rsquo;s critique of Bellermann&rsquo;s 
consonance/dissonance classification in vol. 1, 120&ndash;22. See also his 
reference in vol. 2, 101, to &ldquo;the principle that all intervals are 
conceived only in relation to the bass even in three-voice 
counterpoint. . .&rdquo; It is interesting to note that Schenker&rsquo;s followers do not 
necessarily 
concur with his apparent preference for CP2. In &ldquo;Strict Counterpoint 
and 
Tonal Theory,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 19:2 (1975), 282, John 
Rothgeb prefers &ldquo;to stand by the postulate that intervals are measured 
only in relation to the bass.&rdquo; Yet in <i>Counterpoint in Composition 
</i> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1969), 28, Felix Salzer and Carl Schachter 
refer to &ldquo;the erroneous but rather prevalent idea that any dissonance 
is 
permissible in three-part texture if it occurs between upper 
voices.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Counterpoint</i>, vol. 2, 1&ndash;2 (emphasis

Composition</i>, 27: 
&ldquo;Often the diminished  is listed among the consonant chords. 
Strictly 
speaking this is not true since it contains an unequivocally dissonant 
interval. However, the fact that the dissonance does not involve the 
lowest part and the similarity in degree of tension between this chord 
and 
the other  chords allows us to employ the diminished  as if it 
were 
a consonance.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Counterpoint</i>, vol. 2, 2. Cf. Rothgeb, &ldquo;Strict 
Counterpoint and 
Tonal Theory,&rdquo; 282: &ldquo;In the  chord of strict counterpoint, unlike 
that of free composition, both intervals, the fifth and the sixth, must 
be 
regarded as absolute rather than as a verticalization of a passing 
motion. 
The fifth asserts that the bass tone is the fundamental of the chord, 
while 
the sixth denies it; it is this harmonic contradiction that rules out 
the 
.&rdquo; Once again, Salzer and Schachter (<i>Counterpoint in 
Composition</i>, 
28) reject the validity of CP2 in the first place: &ldquo;In the chord. . . 
[&lt;d1,a1,b1&gt;, or &lt;d1,b1,a2&gt;] there exists no dissonance with respect to 
the lowest voice. Nevertheless the chord is a dissonance and must be 
excluded. The dissonances of the second and seventh are too strong to 
be 
canceled out by the presence of a supporting tone in the lowest part. . .&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Counterpoint</i>, vol. 2, 3.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Rothgeb attempts in a footnote to rescue some sense 
out of this 
statement by explaining that the remark &ldquo;triads. . . to be treated as 
consonant&rdquo; applies to free composition.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Given that any root-position seventh chord violates 
CP2 as well as 
CP1, it seems pedantic to continue to employ the distinction between 
the 
two versions of Schenker&rsquo;s Consonance Principle. Through the
