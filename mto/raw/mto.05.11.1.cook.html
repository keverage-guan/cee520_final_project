<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] I take as my starting point an argument that I&rsquo;ve made in 
another article:<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> that you can&rsquo;t draw a categorical distinction between the 
kind of improvisation found in jazz and the kind of performance &ldquo;of&rdquo; 
pre-existing scores characteristic of the Western &ldquo;art&rdquo; tradition. The impetus 
to make this kind of categorical distinction comes from the literature of jazz, 
perhaps as a result of critics and musicologists who seek to construct their own 
cultural identity in opposition to the perceived hegemony of thinking associated 
with the Western &ldquo;art&rdquo; tradition. (Move outside academia and that might seem an 
absurd contention in relation to the actual hegemony of popular musics, but that 
would be a third article).</p>

<p>[2] I can focus what is at issue through two diametrically opposed quotes. On 
the one hand, Ingrid Monson writes that &ldquo;meaningful theorizing about jazz 
improvisation at the level of the ensemble must take the interactive, 
collaborative context of musical invention as a point of departure. This context 
has no parallel in the musical practice of Western classical composers of the 
common practice period&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> On the other hand, Alfred Schutz writes that &ldquo;there 
is no difference in principle between the performance of a string quartet and 
the improvisations at a jam session of accomplished jazz players&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
Reconciliation is impossible; the standoff could hardly be more complete.
</p>

<p>[3] In the original paper I referred to, I pursued a circuitous route that took in, 
among other things, ideological issues relating to orality as against literacy 
that boil down to something close to racial essentialism. I&rsquo;m not going to open 
that can of worms now, and will instead move directly to a very simple 
demonstration of why I don&rsquo;t think Monsons distinction between jazz and &lsquo;the 
musical practice of Western classical composers of the common practice period&rsquo; 
stands up. All I need do is juxtapose two passages by musicians who combine an 
academic career with a high level of performance accomplishment. The first is 
from Monson herself (she plays jazz trumpet): she writes of a particular moment 
in the Jaki Byard Quartet&rsquo;s recording of &ldquo;Bass-ment Blues&rdquo; that</p>

<blockquote>Dawson anticipates and reinforces Tucker&rsquo;s continuing triplet 
	rhythms in measures 5 and 6 by playing a triplet-based fill between the 
	snare, tom-toms and bass drum<nobr>. . . .</nobr> [Dawson] reinforces the flow of triplet 
	eighths in the solo bass line<nobr> . . . </nobr>his accentuation on the snare articulates 
	a quarter-note triplet against this flow that pushes towards completion on 
	beat 3 of this measure. Dawson could not have known for sure whether Tucker 
	would continue with eighth notes in measure 6 but correctly anticipated that 
	he would<nobr>. . . .</nobr> While Dawson&rsquo;s decision to play triplets in measure 6 might be 
	predicted in a syntactic sense<nobr> . . . </nobr>there is 
nothing that could have predicted the exact choices made by these individual 
musicians. Such spontaneous, fortuitous moments of coming together or hooking up 
are highly prized by musicians.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[4] And now compare John Potter&rsquo;s (1998: 178&ndash;82) account of singing a passage 
from Antoine Brumel&rsquo;s <i>Missa Victimae Paschali</i>:</p>
<blockquote>The superius and bassus enter together but have to negotiate the 
	tempo, since there is no movement on the second beat. This immediately means 
	that the two singers are in very close aural contact with one another. The 
	altus imitates the superius half a bar later, so he has to have been in 
	similarly close contact with the superius, who has been giving him the 
	music. At the end of bar 1 for a brief instant the three singers sound a G, 
	an A and a B flat simultaneously. It is only a passing moment but it creates 
	a moment of acute pleasure that they may wish to prolong<nobr>. . . .</nobr> There is a high 
	degree of mutual trust as the scales rise and fall<nobr>. . . .</nobr> [T]he voices are setting up patterns of tension and relaxation, 
acutely conscious of each other, both seeking to accommodate each other&rsquo;s 
desires and to satisfy themselves.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[5] And whereas Potter isn&rsquo;t talking about music of the common practice period, 
the sort of approach he is putting forward is just as applicable to, say, a 
Mozart quartet. What happens in the performance of music like this? The players 
may well play the notes exactly as Mozart wrote them. And yet they don&rsquo;t play 
them exactly as Mozart wrote them, because every note in the score is subject to 
the contextual negotiation of intonation, precise dynamic value, articulation, 
timbral quality, and so forth. For example, the performers stay in time not 
because each accommodates his or her playing to an external beat (as when studio 
musicians record to a click track), but because each is continuously listening 
to the others, accommodating his or her timing to the others&rsquo;, giving rise to a 
shared, communal temporality. This kind of social interaction takes place in the 
interstices of the score, in the zones of indeterminacy incorporated within it: 
either because the notation doesn&rsquo;t specify something at all (timbre, for 
example, beyond the specification of the instrument), or because the score 
supplies a categorical value that isn&rsquo;t intended for literal execution but 
instead needs to be negotiated and refined in performance. Monson argues for an 
understanding of musical structure that has &ldquo;as one of its central functions the 
construction of social context&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> She is thinking of jazz, but any Mozart 
quartet embodies this: the score choreographs a series of ongoing social 
engagements between players, setting up a shared framework or goal (a shared 
mission, if you like) but delegating detailed decisions to be made in real time 
by the relevant individuals in light of local conditions&mdash;to be improvised, in 
short, as so much in everyday life is. A Mozart quartet is not just a 
representation but an enaction of community.</p>

<p>[6] I have argued elsewhere<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> that there is a mismatch between the everyday 
practices of musical culture and the composition-centered, which is also to say 
score-centered, ways in which musicologists represent that culture, and I don&rsquo;t 
want to repeat those arguments here. In brief, the principal source of this 
orientation towards the written text lies in the origins of musicology within 
the nineteenth-century project of nationalist philology; this gave rise to the 
idea that meaning is inherent in the text, so that performing it becomes an act 
of reproduction, something essentially peripheral to musical culture (in the 
same way that reading aloud is seen as peripheral to literary culture). A 
further formative influence on musicology was the cult of the composer that 
began in Beethoven&rsquo;s lifetime and reached a climax around a century later. The 
idea of the musical text that results from this is rather different, in that it 
is seen as a vehicle for the composer&rsquo;s voice, so that the performer&rsquo;s job 
becomes less one of reproducing the text than of conforming to the intentions 
behind the text; on this model, meaning may not be inherent in the text&mdash;but it 
is still predefined, so that performance remains a matter of getting it right, 
of adequacy, rather than of contributing in a fundamentally creative manner to 
the generation of musical meaning in real time. But having said this, we don&rsquo;t 
really believe that performance is such a banal activity as this would suggest. 
There is, that&rsquo;s to say, a mismatch between what we believe and the conceptual 
apparatus at hand for expressing those beliefs.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Bryn Harrison, <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i>, page 4 (mm. 70&ndash;84)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="cook_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="cook_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[7] Yet the score of Bryn Harrison&rsquo;s <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i> might look like a vindication 
of the &ldquo;performance as reproduction&rdquo; paradigm. On the fourth page, for example 
(<b>Example 1</b>), there are two broadly similar passages ending in a trill, and Harrison 
employs a device borrowed from Morton Feldman: the same pattern of irregular 
time signatures appears on each system within a page (the next page is 
completely different). What is basically happening is that the same musical 
material is being passed through different metrical grids, or more precisely 
it's being passed through the same metrical grids but offset. That means that 
the composer has to look for a different pattern of rhythmic approximations each 
time the material appears, as it were presenting it from a different metrical 
perspective, so that as Harrison puts it &ldquo;I think what you<nobr> . . . </nobr>get in a good 
performance is a sense of this spatial contraction and expansion and things 
going softly against each other&rdquo;.</p>

<p>[8] The outcome of this process is a forbiddingly complex notation full of 
nested irrational relationships: in this respect it looks like something from 
Finnissy or Ferneyhough. And if you are going to use such complex rhythmic 
notation to represent your music, it stands to reason that you want it to be 
very accurately performed: after all, if it isn&rsquo;t exactly this rhythmic 
execution that you are after, then what possible justification can there be for 
using so challenging a notation, as against for example using a space-time 
notation? That, it would appear, is what Harrison meant by a &ldquo;good performance&rdquo;, 
as you can see if I provide more of the passage I have just quoted:
</p>

<blockquote>BRYN HARRISON: Obviously I&rsquo;d like to think of the player as aiming 
	for as much rhythmic precision as possible, and in fact although I&rsquo;d have to 
	go over and really work out those figurations myself to know just exactly 
	how accurate that is, I think what you<nobr> . . . </nobr>get in a good performance is a sense of this 
spatial contraction and expansion and things going softly against each 
other.</blockquote>

<p>[9] Of course, the suspicion to which such notations have given rise ever since 
Stockhausen&rsquo;s <i>Klavierst&uuml;cke I&ndash;IV</i> is that nobody <i>does</i> perform them 
accurately, and that they serve at most to deconstruct sedimented patterns of 
eye-hand interaction, perhaps resulting in performances that have an 
improvisatory feel hard to create otherwise. As a matter of fact, however, 
Philip Thomas&rsquo;s performances were remarkably accurate in terms of durational 
realization. At this point I should explain the nature of the project on which 
I&rsquo;m now drawing, which was a collaboration between Bryn Harrison, Philip Thomas, 
Eric Clarke, and myself. Thomas, a pianist based in Sheffield who specializes in 
contemporary music, commissioned <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i> for a series of concerts in which 
he was also playing music by Morton Feldman. Both acoustic and MIDI recordings 
were made of the rehearsals and the first public performance (Thomas was playing 
a Yamaha Disklavier grand), and in addition Clarke interviewed both Thomas and 
Harrison shortly after the first performance. In addition we recorded a 
run-through early in the rehearsal process in which Thomas and Harrison worked 
together. The quotations I use in this paper come from these various sources, 
plus the contributions of each of the collaborators to a forthcoming article.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>

<p>[10] Clarke analyzed the MIDI data of various passages from <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i> in order 
to measure the extent to which Thomas&rsquo; playing actually corresponded to the 
specifications of the score. Of course, it&rsquo;s not entirely obvious what the best 
way to measure this might be, given the textural as well as rhythmic complexity 
of the music, with what are notated as three interlocking lines&mdash;though the 
effect isn&rsquo;t of three independent lines but rather of a more homogeneous, 
rippling texture. Clarke&rsquo;s first approach, as you might expect, was to measure 
how accurately each note was timed, treating the texture as a single, composite 
series of attacks: 
<b>Figure 1</b>< shows the data for the top line of page 4 (measures 70&ndash;73), 
with the open circles showing the notated values, and the filled-in ones the 
performed ones. (Thomas&rsquo;s performance of the whole of this page at the premiere 
is reproduced as <b>Sound Example 1</b>.) Without going into details, the overall 
durational profile is reproduced reasonably accurately, but there is little 
correspondence in terms of rhythmic detail; that would be compatible with the 
cynical view of notational complexity I put forward in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>[11] However this approach doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the way in which Thomas 
actually learnt the piece. In his article contribution, he says of this passage:</p>

<blockquote>Each of the three lines has its own internal energy, which is difficult to 
sustain throughout its duration. I felt that the only way to learn this was to 
get to know each line on its own, and then in pairs before putting them all 
together, much like Bach counterpoint. In order to ascertain the degree to which 
a note in one voice occurred very soon after or just quite soon after another 
voice I would in some cases have to calculate the relationships to the nearest 
hundredth of a second to be sure of the correct order, and temporal proximity, 
of the events. When putting everything together I would then find points that I 
could identify as markers, such as a downbeat in one voice which the other 
voices could respond to, always trying to hear the individual energy of each 
line as learned on its own.</blockquote>


<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 2</b>. Timing profile for mm. 70&ndash;84, lowest voice only</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="cook_examples.php?id=2&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 2 thumbnail" src="cook_fig2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>


<p>[12] So Clarke now looked at the timing profile of each individual line, instead 
of measuring it across the composite texture (<b>Figure 2</b>). This graph shows the 
data for just the lowest voice across the whole of page 4, and&mdash;again without 
going into details&mdash;you can see that this time there is a much closer fit, and 
the same applied to the other lines too. In terms of how Thomas conceived and operationalized the music, then, his performance was extremely accurate, and in 
fact was so almost from the beginning of the rehearsal process; as Clarke 
comments in the article, &ldquo;This then is powerful evidence for the rhythmic 
integrity of the three individual voices, and their very close relationship with 
the rhythmic notation of the score.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[13] So far, then, it might seem that the idea of performance as reproduction is 
vindicated: even in music as complexly notated as this, the performance 
corresponds as closely to the score as it would be reasonable to expect, and 
Thomas&rsquo; account of how he learnt the piece&mdash;practicing each line separately 
before putting them together, even using a calculator to work out the exact 
relationships between them&mdash;might well suggest that accurate rendition, in a 
word reproduction, was his aim. In fact, if anything, Thomas seems to 
underestimate the accuracy of his performance, as came out in an exchange 
between him and Clarke (they were talking about a passage on page 6 of <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i>):</p>

<blockquote>ERIC CLARKE: But God, I mean it&rsquo;s, does he really want it so, I mean, you 
	know, like the second bar of page 6, you&rsquo;ve got a 3 in the time of 2, within 
	a 6 in the time of 5, within a 5/16 bar<nobr> . . . </nobr><br>
	PHILIP THOMAS: Oh, but that&rsquo;s not complicated, really, that&rsquo;s, forget the 
six in the space of five, so if you played it without the six in the space of 
five it would be [sings], and six in the space of five simply means it&rsquo;s a 
little bit faster, so those two bars would be [sings], you just simply nudge the 
beat on a bit faster<nobr>. . . .</nobr> I mean it&rsquo;s correct as I, I mean, hearing it on the Disklavier, 
	if someone was going to really meticulously see the timings of that, then it 
	would be different every time. I&rsquo;m not going to be, it&rsquo;s not going to be 
	exact<nobr>. . . .</nobr> I hope no one listens to music really hearing things as they are, 
	6 in the space of 5<nobr>. . . .</nobr> It&rsquo;s just a notational device which encourages me to 
	just move on a little bit here.</blockquote>
	
<p>[14] That final comment indicates that, for all the accuracy which he actually 
achieved in performance, Thomas thought of the notation less as the 
specification of a sound object than as a stimulus to the performer to respond 
in a musically meaningful way. Indeed he came back to this several times in the 
interview:</p>

<blockquote>PHILIP THOMAS: This is a classic kind of notational device to prompt the 
	performer to respond in ways which will always keep it floating and never 
	rooted in anything, always keep it changing<nobr>. . . .</nobr> It&rsquo;s not highly calculated 
	stuff, it&rsquo;s more a way of just inspiring the performer to do certain kinds 
	of things, and hopefully the listeners won&rsquo;t be thinking about how is that 
	notated too much, you know, as you say, it&rsquo;s just this constantly 
	fluctuating, it&rsquo;s a wash of sound, the same notes the whole time, just the 
	pedal down, I think it&rsquo;s very beautiful.</blockquote>
	
<p>[15] But the most revealing statement came in the run-through with Thomas and 
Harrison. Thomas had just played the same passage that he and Clarke had 
discussed at the interview, and the following exchange took place:</p>

<blockquote>PHILIP THOMAS: How does it feel the last section, when it&rsquo;s more 
	complicated rhythm between the two hands?<br>
	BRYN HARRISON: You can feel the change from something that is in one metre 
	to two, definitely, you get a slight feeling of acceleration as well, which 
	is nice.<br>
	PHILIP THOMAS: Do you think it&rsquo;s accurate? I think I&rsquo;m pretty accurate.<br>
	BRYN HARRISON: As far as I can tell, I&rsquo;m struggling to tell<nobr>. . . .</nobr><br>
	PHILIP THOMAS: You kind of do it so much, I&rsquo;ve practised it, and then you 
get used to it, and it gets compromised again, so I&rsquo;ve got to keep kicking 
myself in the arse to kind of take it apart again, I think that&rsquo;s the problem, 
I&rsquo;ve got to keep unraveling it.<br>
	BRYN HARRISON: Otherwise you get used to the sound and keep imitating 
	yourself in a slightly inaccurate way really.</blockquote>
	
<p>[16] Performance, then, as Thomas conceives and practices it, isn&rsquo;t a matter of 
reproducing an overlearnt series of actions, however accurately. Rather, it 
consists of an interpretive engagement with the notation that can only be done 
in real time, that has to be enacted afresh on each occasion of performance&mdash;and 
it is here that I come back to the hidden social dimension of solo performance 
that I talked about, for this engagement with the notation is a two-way process, 
a process of interaction, a vehicle through which performance acquires the 
quality that Lonnie Hillyer ascribed to jazz improvisation when he spoke of it as 
&ldquo;really like a guy having a conversation with himself&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>. And as Thomas sees 
it, the result of this real-time interaction is the generation of a kind of 
energy which wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be there. This is how he explains it in the 
joint article:</p>

<blockquote>As I devise a strategy for counting, a certain energy is created in my 
	mind which impacts upon the articulation of the gestures. Page 5, for 
	example, consists very simply of the same three-note cluster repeated at 
	different dynamics, with slightly different durations, and positioned 
	irregularly throughout the page. The complexity of the counting needed to 
	measure accurately the lengths of the intervening rests is, of course, 
	unheard by the listener; but the impact of that counting upon the 
	articulation of the cluster across time is such that each sound has its own 
	energy. If Bryn had notated this using either a simpler rhythmic strategy, 
	or space-time notation, that energy would, I suggest, be noticeably lacking.</blockquote>
	
<p>[17] The result is that in terms of human activity there is a real difference 
between performing and, so to speak, merely imitating the sound that performance 
makes. This is something that Thomas spelled out in his interview, too, in 
connection with the idea that you can perform Ferneyhough&rsquo;s music by reducing 
the rhythms to a simpler metrical framework which can then be subjected to 
nuance, so reproducing more or less the effect of the original notation: This 
kind of simplified transcription, Thomas complained, suggests that the original 
notation is needlessly complex&mdash;&ldquo;and it is a completely ridiculous notion&rdquo;, he 
added, &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s as if rhythmic notation affects duration alone, but of 
course it doesn&rsquo;t&rdquo;. In this way the transcription &ldquo;would sound entirely 
different from what Ferneyhough had written, the effect would be completely 
different&rdquo;.</p>

<p>[18] The extent to which this difference&mdash;the difference in energy that Thomas 
spoke of&mdash;actually communicates itself to listeners is a question that could 
only be settled by further empirical work. But I hope I have said enough to 
establish the general point I wanted to make. We have here the kind of music 
that, with its abstract, mathematical notation, might be thought most amenable 
to the paradigm of performance as reproduction, and analysis of the MIDI 
recordings shows that accuracy of reproduction is achieved to a remarkably high 
degree. And yet, at the same time, an ethnographical approach reveals a quite 
different conception&mdash;what would once have been called a folk theory&mdash;and, 
presumably, a quite different pattern of intentional activity on the musicians&rsquo; 
part (for it is obvious from the transcript of the play-through session that 
Thomas and Harrison were thinking along very much the same lines). And here 
there are three points I would like to bring out.</p>

<p>[19] The first of these points is that there is space in both Thomas&rsquo; and 
Harrison&rsquo;s thinking for the performer. In his interview Harrison said this in so 
many words:</p>

<blockquote>BRYN HARRISON: I wouldn&rsquo;t want to feel I was one of those composers who 
	feel that there&rsquo;s no flexibility in terms of what the player can bring to a 
	piece, I think that&rsquo;s where the sort of human aspect comes in and I think 
	that that&rsquo;s the really, really important part of music-making as far as I&rsquo;m 
	concerned.</blockquote>
	
<p>[20] But he also said something that grounds this view of the performer&rsquo;s role 
in his thinking about composition. Referring to the New York-based artist and 
friend of John Cage&rsquo;s, Harrison observed:</p>

<blockquote>BRYN HARRISON: Jasper Johns said that &ldquo;Sometimes I see it and then paint 
	it. Other times I paint it and then see it&rdquo;. And I really like that quote, 
	because I think in some ways the way that I&rsquo;m dealing with rhythm and the 
	setup on the page, it&rsquo;s not purely deterministic in my point of view, even 
	though you know, it&rsquo;s carefully regulated on the page but in some ways I&rsquo;m 
	writing it to hear it, as much as I&rsquo;m hearing it to write it.</blockquote>
	
<p>[21] In other words, in contrast to the still influential nineteenth-century 
idea of the composer possessing a vision which is communicated through the 
score, Harrison understands composition as a process of discovery&mdash;a process 
which does not come to an end when the score is completed, but continues into 
the performance:</p>

<blockquote>BRYN HARRISON: I think the thing I&rsquo;ve learnt is that you don&rsquo;t have to 
have the answers to every question as well, I think you know, when I first 
started getting performances and I&rsquo;d go and attend rehearsals, you know I was, 
well I was probably scared stiff for one thing, but there was always this 
feeling that any question that a player had you had to feel you immediately knew 
the answer to that question, and of course you&rsquo;ve got to trust their judgment as 
	well.</blockquote>
	
<p>[22] As well as creating a space for the creative contribution of the performer, 
in a way that the reproduction paradigm does not, these comments emphasize the 
extent to which the meaning of music is emergent, in other words to which it 
arises from the act of performance itself.</p>

<p>[23] The second point I&rsquo;d like to draw out is that approaches to performance 
analysis that focus exclusively on recordings&mdash;on the acoustic outputs of 
performance&mdash;risk misreading or simply not grasping the social meaning inherent 
in the act of performance: much as I applaud the efforts that have been made in 
the last decade or two to develop a musicology of performance, we are vulnerable 
to the claim that the voices of performers have not really been heard, that 
theorists have as it were taken it upon themselves to speak for performers in a 
kind of ventriloquism. If that is the case, then the project I have been 
describing is in the most literal way an attempt to bring performers&rsquo; voices 
into the field of study, and the suggestion I am making is that ethnographic 
approaches have a great deal of potential for contextualizing the now more 
traditional approaches to the empirical study of performance.</p>

<p>[24] The final point follows on from this. When the &ldquo;New&rdquo; musicologists of the 
1990s identified what they saw as a complicity between traditional musical 
analysis and the ideology of musical autonomy, they reacted against the whole of 
idea of &ldquo;close reading&rdquo;; the same happened when, a decade or two before that, 
theatre studies broke away from literary studies. But there is no need to throw 
away the baby with the bathwater, because there is not an either/or relationship 
between ethnographical, contextual approaches on the one hand, and the close 
reading of texts (under which I include both scores and performance data) on the 
other. Moreover, in music of the Western &ldquo;art&rdquo; tradition, this both/and 
relationship extends to the very topic of study. In the wake of Lydia Goehr&rsquo;s 
influential book <i>The Museum of Musical Works,</i> there was a general tendency to 
debunk the idea of musical works, and it would be very easy to imagine a 
musicology of performance that went the same way as theatre studies. 
(Christopher Small&rsquo;s writings, however valuable as a corrective to the then 
prevailing assumptions of mainstream musicology, provide an idea of what such a 
musicology of performance might look like.) Yet one of the characteristic 
features of the Western &ldquo;art&rdquo; tradition is the dual life of musical works: on 
the one hand as frameworks for a performance culture that is distinguishable 
from that of jazz improvisation only in terms of degree, not category; and on 
the other, as objects of contemplation or critical reflection, if only to that 
small but culturally influential circle of the musical literati.</p>

<p>[25] In moving so rapidly from Bryn Harrison&rsquo;s 
<i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i> to music in general 
I am, of course, implying that the kind of performative meaning I have been 
talking about is something present in musical performance in general, at least 
within the Western &ldquo;art&rdquo; tradition, rather than something purely idiosyncratic, 
applying only to &ldquo;New Complexity&rdquo; music, or perhaps more generally to music 
outside the so-called &ldquo;common practice&rdquo; tradition. Philip Thomas, it appears, 
would incline to the latter view. Immediately after the passage from our joint 
article in which he talks about energy, he discusses the way in which the use of 
bar lines affects the manner of performance: the notation of the opening gesture 
as occurring after a semiquaver rest, he says, &ldquo;suggests to the performer a 
different way of breathing, if you like, with the initial attack bouncing off an 
imaginary wall rather than coming down on the traditional down-beat&rdquo;. Having 
cited some other, similar cases, he continues:</p>

<blockquote>Here we see how despite the apparent rigidity of the barring structure 
that Bryn laid out for himself, he has used the bars to bring life to the 
material and not simply to contain it. These are examples of the notation 
playing a crucial role in the nature of the material. One could feasibly learn, 
say, a Beethoven sonata in a purely aural manner, simply through repeatedly 
listening to a recording: the correct pitches, rhythms, tempi, dynamics, and so 
on could all be learned in this way. But in <i>&ecirc;tre-temps</i>, and much 
	music like it, the visual appearance of the notation is fundamental to the 
	character and production of the material: the notation and the material are 
	inseparable.</blockquote>
	
<p>[26] Yet I wonder if the contrast with a Beethoven sonata is as self-evident as 
it might appear. Certainly you could learn a Beethoven sonata that way. But such 
an approach runs counter to the established pedagogical view that you make music 
your own by going back to the score and creating your own interpretation of it. 
And after all, in principle you could (with whatever difficulty) do the same 
with Harrison&rsquo;s music: the point Thomas is making isn&rsquo;t really so much that this 
can&rsquo;t be done, but that a certain energy&mdash;a dimension of the music that derives 
from the often uneasy relationship between score and sound, between written 
notation and acoustic realization&mdash;will be lacking. And if that is true of 
Harrison, then I see no reason to believe that it is not true of Beethoven as 
well. To say that there is more to musical performance than the sound it makes 
may sound merely flippant. But to do justice at one and the same time to the 
sight and the sound of music is perhaps the most challenging demand we face in 
making sense not just of musical performance, but of the tradition of Western 
&ldquo;art&rdquo; music itself.</p>
