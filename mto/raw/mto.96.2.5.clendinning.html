<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In &ldquo;Harmonic and Formal Processes in Ligeti&rsquo;s Net-Structure
Compositions,&rdquo; Miguel Roig-Francoli investigates three of Ligeti&rsquo;s
&ldquo;net-structure&rdquo; compositions: <i>Ramifications</i> (1968&ndash;69), the first
movement of the <i>Chamber Concerto</i> (1969&ndash;70), and the fifth movement
of the <i>Second String Quartet</i> (1968).  He begins his article by
introducing the concept of &ldquo;net structures&rdquo; and identifying their
basic characteristics.  He divides the net-structure techniques into
four categories, each of which is illustrated by close analyses of
small-scale harmonic features of sections of the works.  He then
considers longer-range connections in these movements, which he
investigates using reductive techniques.  He concludes with a
consideration of symmetry and formal balance in the large-scale form
of these compositions.  In this review, I consider each element of his
discussion in turn, providing additional background on some aspects
and examining his methodology and his analytical conclusions.<p>

[2] Like Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and
other European composers of the 1960s, Ligeti has often commented
publicly on his own works, with some of his remarks recorded in the
context of interviews or program notes for performances or
recordings.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Although a composer&rsquo;s comments on his works should be
examined critically (comments may be used to obfuscate rather than
enlighten), Ligeti&rsquo;s remarks provide a sense of how he thinks about
his compositional processes, and have been useful to analysts who
study his works.  Ligeti uses a variety of terms to refer to his
compositional techniques from the 1960s and 1970s; those most
frequently used are &ldquo;micropolyphony&rdquo; and &ldquo;meccanico.&rdquo;  Ligeti
typically uses micropolyphony and meccanico as &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; terms,
referring to a wide range of pieces from the 1960s and early 1970s
with specific shared characteristics.<p>

[3] The term &ldquo;net-structure,&rdquo; which Roig-Francoli selects, is one used
in the interviews in a more general sense than meccanico and
micropolyphony.  Roig-Francoli defines a net-structure as &ldquo;a
continuous web of finely-woven lines or repeated patterns in a
constant, interactive process of transformation of one or more
parameters, such as pitch, rhythm, texture, dynamics, or timbre&rdquo; (page
243).  Unlike the terms micropolyphony and meccanico, which Ligeti
uses <i>analytically</i>, net-structure is not usually mentioned in the
context of specific pieces or techniques.  Rather, it is consistently
used <i>qualitatively</i> to refer to a <i>feeling</i> Ligeti had about the
textures of the pieces&mdash;an allusion to a childhood dream where Ligeti
was caught in a room full of entangling webs.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[4] Roig-Francoli does not include works such as <i>Lontano</i> and <i>Lux
Aeterna</i> in the &ldquo;net-structure&rdquo; group, although Ligeti&rsquo;s own remarks
include them along with earlier works like <i>Apparitions</i> (the original
reference point for the web dream anecdote) and <i>Atmospheres</i>.  In
footnote 5, Roig-Francoli acknowledges this point, but attempts to
distinguish these two works by saying that the process is &ldquo;linear&rdquo; in
one and &ldquo;harmonic&rdquo; in the other (page 243).  This is a false
distinction&mdash;in both cases the changes in harmonies are created by
&ldquo;chromatic fluctuation or intervallic expansion and contraction&rdquo; as
Roig-Francoli confirms later: &ldquo;The process of constant chromatic
transformation, a procedure which Ligeti has used widely both in
micropolyphonic and harmonic textures<nobr> . . .</nobr>&rdquo; (page 246).  In the
following paragraph, after he has eliminated pieces from Ligeti&rsquo;s
broad category of &ldquo;net-structure,&rdquo; Roig-Francoli does the same with
the term &ldquo;meccanico&rdquo; (page 244), a term which Ligeti uses in reference
to an anecdote about a story of a widow with a house full of ticking
clocks.  Ligeti uses this term in a general way, to describe music
with a sense of mechanical action that is reminiscent of
&ldquo;malfunctioning machinery.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Roig-Francoli interprets Ligeti&rsquo;s
comments about meccanico as referring only to single pitch
repetitions; yet the context of Ligeti&rsquo;s comments includes a question
about the opening of <i>Continuum</i> and a description of a piece that he
wrote as a schoolboy in which &ldquo;the left hand plays a mechanical
progression of a tritone and the right hand something equally
machine-like; two little machines at play&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>&mdash;a passage very similar
to the opening of <i>Continuum</i> in which repeated patterns of two or
more pitches are used in each linear strand.<p>

[5] As Roig-Francoli notes, however, &ldquo;Ligeti&rsquo;s use of technical terms
descriptive of his music is not always consistent&rdquo; (page 244).  In order
to avoid terminological confusion, previous analysts have found it
useful to coin terms of their own for groups of Ligeti&rsquo;s compositions,
using specific techniques rather than attempting to use one of his
terms.  In my own work, I use the term <i>microcanon</i> (invented as a
subcategory of <i>micropolyphony</i>) to designate textures formed from a
pitch succession set canonically in many voices at short time
intervals, and <i>pattern-meccanico</i> (a subcategory of <i>meccanico</i>) for
textures in which several linear strands, each constructed from small
groups of pitches repeated mechanically, are overlaid to create a
contrapuntal texture.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Compositions using microcanonic techniques
include <i>Lux aeterna</i> (1966), <i>Lontano</i> (1967), and the ninth movement
of the <i>Ten Pieces for Wind Quintet</i> (1968).  Works with one or more
passages of pattern-meccanico textures include <i>Continuum</i> (1968),
<i>Coulee</i> (1969), and the fifth movement of the <i>Second String
Quartet</i>.  Later works, such as <i>Ramifications</i>, the <i>Chamber
Concerto</i>, the &ldquo;Selbstportrait&rdquo; movement of <i>Three Pieces for Two
Pianos</i> (1976), and the <i>Drei Phantasien nach Friedrich Holderlin</i>
(1982) combine microcanon with pattern-meccanico in various ways.<p>

[6] After his introductory comments, Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s attention turns
to the analysis of &ldquo;harmonic processes&rdquo; in Ligeti&rsquo;s net-structures.
While Roig-Francoli is careful to try to distance himself from
previous analysts of Ligeti&rsquo;s music, his analytical approach is built
on foundations provided by other writers. Most of the analytical
comments are directed toward <i>Ramifications</i>, one of several works in
which Ligeti combines pattern-meccanico techniques with microcanon
(illustrated in Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s Example 1).<p>

[7] Roig-Francoli begins his analysis of <i>Ramifications</i> by
partitioning each instrument&rsquo;s flowing melodic line of pitches with
brief durations into small repeated units, or patterns.  He does not
state the criteria he uses for partitioning, but seems to be following
the segmentation procedures established by previous analysts for
pattern-meccanico textures.  Analytical procedures for segmentation in
twentieth-century music typically draw on discontinuities in one or
more aspects of the musical texture&mdash;rests, abrupt changes of range,
separation of melodic strands, durations markedly longer or shorter
than those proceeding or following, and changes in timbre or
articulation.  Repetition of a sequence of pitches or durations can
also be used for partitioning.  In Ligeti&rsquo;s pattern-meccanico
compositions, long rests (more than the notated beat unit), abrupt
changes of range, markedly longer or shorter durations, and noticeable
variation in articulation or timbre are rare, but the formation of the
texture by weaving of individual instrumental parts is typical, making
the initial partition the separation of individual instrumental parts.
Unlike <i>Continuum</i>, which has continuously flowing lines, the
instrumental lines in <i>Ramifications</i> (and other later works like the
&ldquo;Selbstportrait&rdquo; movement of <i>Three Pieces for Two Pianos</i>) do include
brief rests, but their duration is generally less than the notated
beat unit and they do not interrupt the continuous flow of the lines.
The criteria for partitioning this type of texture depends on
recognition of repeated melodic units or patterns.  Each unit is a
series of ascending (or descending) steps or skips, which is separated
from its repetitions by a skip from the highest to lowest (or lowest
to highest) boundary pitches of the pattern (the largest skips in the
melodic line).  Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s segments fit these criteria.<p>

[8] After partitioning, Roig-Francoli then examines the patterns.  One
innovative aspect of his analysis of the opening patterns of
<i>Ramifications</i> (in Example 2a) is the emphasis on the inclusion of
various partitions of the pitch interval [4] in the melodic
<nobr>strands.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></nobr> Rather than explaining the metamorphosis of the patterns
by focusing on voice-leading in the compound melody&mdash;maintenance of
common tones, voice leading by step, and additions of tones&mdash;he
examines the outer interval span and the inner filling of that span as
an approach to the same type of information.  However, in examining
details of his analysis of this example, several problems emerge.
First, Roig-Francoli states that the &ldquo;group cardinality<nobr> . . . </nobr>is
symmetrical, creating the pattern 2&ndash;3&ndash;4&ndash;5&ndash;4&ndash;3&ndash;2&rdquo; (page 246).  However,
the sequence of patterns in its entirety is
2&ndash;2&ndash;3&ndash;4&ndash;3&ndash;3&ndash;4&ndash;4&ndash;4&ndash;5&ndash;4&ndash;4&ndash;4&ndash;3&ndash;3&ndash;3&ndash;2, which is not symmetrical.  He gives
no justification for selecting from the full sequence the individual
patterns that makes the 2&ndash;3&ndash;4&ndash;5&ndash;4&ndash;3&ndash;2 symmetry.  Although the
cardinality of the patterns does, in general, expand from 2 pitches to
5 pitches and contract back to 2, it is not as symmetrical as he makes
it seem.  Second, in this same paragraph, he states that &ldquo;the piece
begins with the pitches A4&ndash;G4, connected at measure 2 by the passing <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4 <nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo; (page 246).  What he does not mention is that the initial A4&ndash;G4
is followed by A4&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 prior to the pattern with A4&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4&ndash;G4.  By what
criteria is the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4 passing?  The spelling of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> here does not
provide useful information&mdash;it simply follows the convention of
spelling a pitch as a sharp when it goes up to the next pitch and as a
flat when it goes down.  These questions can be clarified by examining
the progression of patterns with regard to pattern shifts.  In this
light, the G4 (and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4) are &ldquo;added pitches&rdquo; appended to the

(Roig-Francoli also
emphasizes the symmetrical nature of the chromatic clusters here&mdash;but
chromatic pitch clusters are always symmetrical!)  Without the ability
to eliminate the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>4 as &ldquo;passing&rdquo; there is no real point to be made.<p>

[9] In order to classify various types of net-structures in Example 2 and
those that follow, Roig-Francoli introduces four types of
net-structures: 1) &ldquo;chromatic fluctuation of<nobr> . . . </nobr>short melodic
patterns,&rdquo; 2) &ldquo;chromatic transformation of harmonic cells,&rdquo; 3)
&ldquo;chromatic transformation of triadic units&rdquo; and 4) &ldquo;progressive change
in dynamics, timbre, or rhythm&rdquo; (page 246).  However, his examples show
that the first three of his categories actually involve the same
compositional procedure: step-wise voice-leading (usually involving
half-steps) that achieves gradual transformations in the harmonic
content of the music.  In regard to his first two categories, the
example he cites for his Category 2 (his Example 3) has a microstructure
of rapidly reiterated short melodic patterns just like his example for
Category 1 (his Example 2).  The &ldquo;melodic patterns&rdquo; are the source of the
harmonies involved in the &ldquo;chromatic transformation of harmonic
cells.&rdquo;  The only difference in the two is the size of the pitch
intervals involved in the patterns: Roig-Francoli limits Category 1 to
patterns spanning no more than [6] with no more than [4] between
adjacent pitches.  Although he does not explain the reasons for these
limitations on Category 1 (nor does he explain the lack of specificity
regarding acceptable intervals for Categories 2 or 3), it is possible
that Roig-Francoli makes the distinction because the patterns with
larger intervals between successive pitches are more like
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; harmonic arpeggiations. However, there is fluidity
between the harmonic dimension and the melodic dimension in many of
Ligeti&rsquo;s compositions, and the boundaries between perception of melody
and harmony were elements that Ligeti was exploring in his
compositions at the time these pieces were written.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><p>

[10] In his analysis of Example 3, Roig-Francoli represents his
partitioning of the patterns in a &ldquo;pitch reduction&rdquo; graph, in which
the pitches of each pattern are &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; in harmonies.  As in the
previous example, his interest lies in the partitioning of the outer
span into pitch intervals rather than the voice-leading from one
pattern to the next.  Drawing on Bernard&rsquo;s theory of trichordal
relationships,<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Roig-Francoli isolates several trichords related by
<i>infolding</i> and <i>unfolding</i> ([2][6], [2][8], [6][8], and [8][10]) that
he considers significant in the &ldquo;middleground&rdquo; structure of this
passage (page 248&ndash;249).  His criteria for significance are &ldquo;main points
of structural articulation&rdquo;: beginnings and endings of points of
&ldquo;textural transformation,&rdquo; &ldquo;relatively stable sonorities,&rdquo; harmonies
that initiate or close &ldquo;processes of chromatic expansion or
contraction,&rdquo; and &ldquo;intervallic and spatial symmetrical designs&rdquo; (page
248).  Roig-Francoli defines &ldquo;textural transformation&rdquo; as &ldquo;progressive
changes of patterns or figuration in all instruments&rdquo; (page 248, note
18)&mdash;in other words, a textural transformation is a passage with
frequent pattern shifts or a rapid &ldquo;harmonic rhythm.&rdquo;<p>

[11] A comparison of his reduction with the score reveals some
inconsistencies.  Some of the trichords he selects for his
&ldquo;middleground reduction&rdquo; <i>are</i> highlighted in the musical context&mdash;for
example, [2][6] as the end of an expansion in Group 2, measure 20 and
[8][10] as a resting point in Group 1, measures 21&ndash;22.  Others occur in the
midst of an ongoing process: the &ldquo;textural transformation&rdquo; identified
by Roig-Francoli in measures 20&ndash;21 does not stop at the [6][8] in
Group 1 which he selects, but continues uninterrupted to [10][8];
likewise the [2][6]s in Group 2, measures 22 and 23, and the [6][8] in Group
2, measure 24.  He does not show the eventual goal of the textural
transformation in Group 2 in his example&mdash;the rapid pattern shifts
continue unabated until a reiterated pattern E4&ndash;B4&ndash;G5 in measure 25, a span
of [7][8].<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> In addition, trichords [8][11], [9][10], and [7][8] are
significant in this passage as ending and resting points
(Roig-Francoli recognizes them as significant in his Example 3b), yet are
not accounted for in the trichordal constellation that he discusses.<p>

[12] Roig-Francoli delays consideration of his third type of
net-structure (chromatic transformation of triadic units) to pages 257
and 258, and then only mentions it briefly.  This &ldquo;short shrift&rdquo; is
appropriate since Ligeti does not prioritize &ldquo;triadic units&rdquo; but
treats harmonies with three pitches as one of the possible types of
&ldquo;harmonic cells.&rdquo;  Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s use of the term &ldquo;triadic&rdquo; is
questionable here in any case&mdash;these are trichords made from stacks of
[7]s, [8]s, and [9]s (perfect fifths and major and minor sixths), but
they have no tonal implications, are not derived from chords stacked
in thirds in this context, and are in no way functional.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Although
Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s division of Ligeti&rsquo;s voice-leading techniques into the
first three categories is problematic, the step-wise (but not always
&ldquo;chromatic&rdquo;) voice-leading that he observes in each of these examples
is typical of Ligeti&rsquo;s style in the late 1960s.<p>
[13] The fourth type of Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s net-structures, &ldquo;progressive
change in dynamics, timbre, or rhythm,&rdquo; is certainly an interesting
aspect of Ligeti&rsquo;s music.  Unfortunately, Roig-Francoli does not deal
with these elements in any detail; he provides only a brief surface
description of &ldquo;rhythmic layers&rdquo; and changes in prevailing durations
in two passages from <i>Ramifications</i> to illustrate this &ldquo;category&rdquo;
(pages 250&ndash;252, 257&ndash;258).  The examination of non-pitch elements can be a
complex process, due to changes in the prevailing duration in various
instrumental parts, harmonic rhythm (the rate of change in the pitch
content of patterns), alignment of starting points of patterns
(pattern interaction), dynamics, or timbre.  Additionally, these
elements can interact, supporting&mdash;or contradicting&mdash;the shaping of a
section by range, pitch content, or other factors.  One approach to
the interaction of pitch and non-pitch elements is to separate out
each contributor and consider its effect in the sound of the piece.
But this solution does not capture the full richness of the
interaction.  This aspect of Ligeti&rsquo;s compositions warrants further
investigation.<p>

[14] In addition to <i>Ramifications</i>, Roig-Francoli locates
&ldquo;net-structures&rdquo; in the first movement of Ligeti&rsquo;s <i>Chamber Concerto</i>
(pages 252, 262&ndash;263) and the fifth movement of his <i>Second String
Quartet</i> (pages 252&ndash;253, 256&ndash;257). His comments on the details of these
two pieces add little to the work of previous analysts, aside from the
emphasis on harmonic stacks and registral and associational links
between specific pitches.  Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s representation of the
harmonies of the closing section of the first movement of the <i>Chamber
Concerto</i> in Example 5 suffers from a lack of precision in the distinction
between pitch and pitch class, and a lack of specification of his
segmentation criteria.  Since the final section incorporates octave
doublings of the canon in six octaves, Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s Example 5 is
mislabeled: those are not &ldquo;pitch reductions&rdquo; or &ldquo;pitch collections&rdquo; as
he states in his text, but pitch-class collections.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Unlike the
canon melodies of <i>Ramifications</i>, the canonic line here is not
divided into recurring patterns.  It is unclear how Roig-Francoli
arrives at the scalar segments shown in his Example 5: they are not
patterns or segments of the canon melody.  Presumably, they derive
from temporal segments, but they only roughly correspond to the
pitch-class content within the segments I examined.  The harmonic
process <i>is</i> one of &ldquo;subtraction and addition of single pitches&rdquo;
(page 252); however, close inspection of the canon melody and harmonies
it creates in this section reveals that the process is not as orderly
as is indicated in his example. In his discussion of this example,
Roig-Francoli is interested in the &ldquo;alternation of symmetrical and
asymmetrical states&rdquo; (page 252).  As previously noted, chromatic pitch
collections are always symmetrical&mdash;therefore the symmetricality in
the first three segments that he shows is trivial.  The alternation
between symmetry and asymmetry is a natural by-product of a gradual,
one-pitch-at-a-time expansion outward of chromatic clusters around a
&ldquo;hollow&rdquo; center.  That type of expansion is most logically constructed
by moving one side out a little, compensating by expanding out the
other side, then repeating the process.  This type of systematically
expanding wedge is common in others of Ligeti&rsquo;s compositions,
including the &ldquo;Christe&rdquo; settings from the &ldquo;Kyrie&rdquo; of the <i>Requiem</i>.
Like this example, the <i>Requiem</i> does not expand with a regular
alternation, while the ninth movement of the <i>Ten Pieces for Wind
Quintet</i> does.<p>

[15] The most significant contribution of this article is the
discussion of possible types of longer-range harmonic structures in
Ligeti&rsquo;s music (pages 253&ndash;257).  Roig-Francoli confronts Ligeti&rsquo;s
assertion that his musical forms are non-teleological and
&ldquo;object-like&rdquo; (rather than &ldquo;process-like&rdquo;).  He argues persuasively
that Ligeti&rsquo;s music <i>is</i> teleological, with forward-directed linear
motion created by extended harmonic processes with step-wise
voice-leading between contextually-established local harmonic goals.
He observes that the concept of prolongation is problematic in
compositions like Ligeti&rsquo;s that do not exhibit the characteristics of
tonal function and voice-leading, pitch organization using centricity,
or other large-scale means of predicting specific goals for linear
motion.  In Example 6b, Roig-Francoli introduces a &ldquo;long-range pitch
reduction,&rdquo; a type of &ldquo;middleground sketch&rdquo; which he states &ldquo;displays
the voice-leading connections between major points of formal
articulation&rdquo; (page 253).  His graph is not intended to imply
prolongation or directed motion, but instead to display associational
links between specific pitches and intervals.<p>

[16] As with other systems of reductional analysis, such as
Schenkerian reductions, the parsing and interpretation of foreground
events are crucial to middleground decisions.  Details of
Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s graph are difficult to evaluate since the presentation
of this graph is not supported by detailed analysis of each of the
sections represented in the longer-range graph.  For the most part,
his comments (and his graph) parallel the observations made by
previous analysts who provide a more detailed foreground analysis.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s graph provides a means for highlighting specific
pitches and locations in the piece&mdash;and this is difficult to
accomplish with detail-rich range graphs (plots of pitches sounding
over time).  Unfortunately, the task of comparing his comments with
his graph (and with the score) is made more difficult by his use of
square-bracket notation to indicate both the size of intervals in
semitones and the reduction of compound intervals.<p>

[17] In the concluding section of this article, entitled &ldquo;Formal
Processes,&rdquo; Roig-Francoli lists four main types of form that he
asserts Ligeti &ldquo;identifies among his compositions&rdquo; (page 260).  This is
a case in point about the dangers of extracting information from
interviews without careful consideration of the context.  In
Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s presentation, these formal categories seem to be
definitive and clear-cut.  However, the context from which they were
extracted is a wandering, informal, and internally-contradictory
conversation from Ligeti&rsquo;s relatively early (1971)
&ldquo;self-interview&rdquo;&mdash;hardly the type of text from which one derives
indisputable categories.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> (Ligeti is uninclined in &ldquo;interviewing
himself&rdquo; to insist he clarify points that are vague or unclear).<p>

[18] After identifying the net-structure compositions as among
Ligeti&rsquo;s &ldquo;balanced, static forms,&rdquo; Roig-Francoli lists the factors
that he intends to use to identify formal and sectional divisions:
&ldquo;harmonic, intervallic, and spatial processes&rdquo;; &ldquo;rhythmic processes&rdquo;;
&ldquo;textural changes&rdquo;; &ldquo;formal articulation&rdquo;; and &ldquo;auxiliary factors<nobr> . . . </nobr>such as instrumentation and dynamics&rdquo; (page 260).  From examining
Figures 2 and 3, it seems that formal balance and golden section
calculations have influenced his choices.  For example, a comparison
of Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s discussion of the formal outline of <i>Ramifications</i>
with Figure 2 and the score, reveals that his <i>comments</i> acknowledge
elisions, overlapping processes, the precise locations of events, and
the continuous nature of each main section, but his <i>chart</i> glosses
over those &ldquo;messy details&rdquo; to present a parallelism between sections
and a correspondence of events to golden section proportions that is
more tenuous in the music than it appears on the chart (pages 260&ndash;262).
Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s chart of the subdivisions of the second large section
in the <i>Chamber Concerto</i> suffers from the same flaw (pages 262&ndash;263).
The precision of golden section calculations in that work is further
disturbed by the presence of varying measure lengths and tempi and by
unmeasured cadenza-like passages.  Comparing Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s
calculations to those made by approximating the length of time that
each measure would last in seconds indicates that some of his
locations may be &ldquo;off&rdquo; by as much as two measures.<p>

[19] This is not to imply that sectional balance (including golden
section proportions at the level of the entire movement) is absent in
Ligeti&rsquo;s music.  Roig-Francoli&rsquo;s locations of the golden section
proportions at the level of the entire movement are more convincing
than his smaller-scale ones, and, as he notes, other analysts have
located golden section proportions overarching entire movements (page
264, note 45).  <i>Lux aeterna</i> provides further evidence that
proportional balance is important to Ligeti.  At the end of the third
section, Ligeti has notated seven measures of rests, the precise
meaning of which is not explained in the score. When Ligeti was asked
about them, he replied they &ldquo;depend on proportions of the durations of
the piece.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The addition of this &ldquo;silent coda&rdquo; changes the total
number of measures from 119 to 126, a difference which affects the
calculation of the golden section (similarly to the silent measures at
the end of <i>Ramifications</i>), but neither calculation of the golden
section corresponds to a significant structural point in the piece.
One explanation of the additional measures is the creation of a
large-scale symmetry in the length of sections: from the beginning to
the end of each canonic section, the three sections are 37, 50,
and 37 measures long (including the seven silent measures), with each
pair of the canonic sections separated by one complete measure without
canon.  These may be the proportions that Ligeti had in mind when he
added the seven measures.<p>

[20] In summary, this article provides an introduction to
<i>Ramifications</i>, the first movement of the <i>Chamber Concerto</i>, and the
fifth movement of the <i>Second String Quartet</i>&mdash;three of Ligeti&rsquo;s
compositions written shortly after <i>Lux aeterna</i>, <i>Lontano</i>, and
<i>Continuum</i> that have not received as much attention in the analytical
literature.  Roig-Francoli makes some interesting observations about
these pieces, but his analysis would benefit from a clearer statement
of the criteria he used for partitioning, delineating categories, and
selecting significant harmonies.  More attention to analytical details
would also strengthen his arguments.  In prioritizing harmonies that
fit trichordal constellations and in his search for symmetries, golden
sections, and sectional parallelisms, Roig-Francoli seems willing to
overlook elisions or other continuities in the musical surface,
canonic processes and voice-leading details, and the exact content or
locations of events in his desire for regularity and order. He should
heed Ligeti&rsquo;s remarks that he quotes (page 265): &ldquo;I detest both absolute
geometrical precision and total openness.  I want a certain order, but
an order slightly disorganized<nobr> . . . </nobr>I love irregularities&rdquo; and &ldquo;prima
la musica, dopo la regola.&rdquo;</p>
