<h3>I</h3>


<p>[1] At the close of an essay which sees off one of Derrida&rsquo;s opponents, 
Christopher Norris sets the following conditions for any future challenge 
to Derrida. He says,
<p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;[A]ny convincing challenge will have to do more than just rehearse what 
amounts to a litany of anti-deconstructionist id&eacute;es re&ccedil;ues. 
It will need to show precisely where Derrida&rsquo;s arguments go wrong; 
where he misreads or misconstrues his philosophical source-texts; or 
where the claims of deconstruction themselves fall prey to a better, more 
adequate, historically informed, or cogent theoretical critique.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p>
</blockquote>

<p>I accept that these conditions are fair, and I am happy to abide by them in 
this paper. What I shall attempt here is a critique first of Derrida 
himself, secondly of textuality and interdisciplinarity, which simplify and 
distort Derrida&rsquo;s writings, and thirdly the use that certain musicologists 
have made of these arguments during the last decade, in writings that 
may today be generally dubbed the New Musicology (a label bound to 
disappear before long). If I were to limit my criticisms to the 
post-structuralist assumptions which pervade much recent work in 
musicology and the other humanities, I might be accused by some of 
attacking too easy a target. It is for this reason that much of the present 
paper confronts the most important source for such ideas, however 
simplified and debased they may have become in their dissemination. I 
will remind the reader at this point that the necessary restrictions on 
space preclude any exhaustive treatment of the issues here; according to 
the Socratic principles examined in the first part of the paper, I would 
encourage further dialogue within the arena of mto-talk.
<p>

[2] Let me begin with a cautionary tale. In Derrida&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s 
Pharmacy,&rdquo; from the collection <i>Dissemination</i>, we find one of the 
most frequently cited examples of a metaphysical text which contains the 
seeds of its own deconstruction<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>. Norris, in his biography of 
Derrida says that it is &ldquo;a good place to start <nobr>. . .</nobr> since Derrida is here 
engaged with something like a mythical inaugural moment in the 
&lsquo;logocentric&rsquo; epoch whose effects (as he argues) reach down from Plato 
to the present day&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>. Let us then begin here too. 
The deconstruction characteristically involves an aspect of the text under 
discussion which would be regarded as marginal: in this case, Derrida 
examines a metaphor, which, he claims, introduces  an element of 
semantic undecidability that threatens to subvert the canonical reading of 
the text. The text is a passage from Plato&rsquo;s <i>Phaedrus</i><sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>, and in 
Derrida&rsquo;s hands it begins to speak against its author; Derrida&rsquo;s &ldquo;close 
reading&rdquo; of the text seeks to demonstrate exactly how the text&rsquo;s rhetorical 
figures may contradict its argument.
<p>

[3] The <i>Phaedrus</i> is an examination of rhetoric, which argues that 
the art is pernicious insofar as it ignores reason and knowledge. Contrary 
to Derrida&rsquo;s reading, Plato does not present rhetoric and philosophy as a 
binary opposition, since he is condemning only some rhetoric, while 
generously conceding that, for example, the rhetorical school of 
Isocrates, one of Plato&rsquo;s own rivals, has much of worth to offer. So Plato 
is not interested in making a rigid and unyielding distinction between the 
logic of an argument, and the way in which it is presented. The passage 
Derrida discusses is centered upon an Egyptian myth which Socrates 
relates to Phaedrus, the superficial young orator, by way of an 
illustration of his arguments on writing. The god Theuth came to 
Thamus, the king of Egypt, offering a long list of his inventions as gifts. 
Thamus first listened to the account Theuth gave of each of his gifts, 
accepting some, while rejecting others, according to his judgement of the 
merits of each. When Theuth arrived at the gift of writing, he said, &ldquo;Here 
is an accomplishment, my lord the king, which will improve both the 
wisdom and the memory of the Egyptians. I have discovered a remedy 
for memory and wisdom.&rdquo; Thamus rejects the gift, with a weighty 
reproof, which is worth quoting in full.
<p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Theuth, my paragon of inventors, the discoverer of an art is not the best 
judge of the good or harm which will accrue to those who practise it. So 
it is in this case; you, who are the father of writing, have out of fondness 
for your offspring attributed to it quite the opposite of its real function. 
Those who acquire it wil cease to exercise their memory and become 
forgetful; they will rely on writing to bring things to their remembrance 
by external signs instead of on their own internal resources. What you 
have discovered is a remedy for recollection, not for memory. And as 
for wisdom, your pupils will have the reputation for it without the 
reality: they will receive a quantity of information without proper 
instruction, and in consequence be thought very knowledgeable when 
they are for the most part quite ignorant. And because they are filled 
with the conceit of wisdom instead of real wisdom they will be a burden 
to society.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p></blockquote>

<p>(Thamus seems to have great insight into the note-taking habits of some 
students, who write furiously and memorise great quantities in the hope 
that these activities will serve as a substitute for understanding.) The 
word I rendered as &ldquo;remedy&rdquo; is in the original &ldquo;ph&aacute;rmakon,&rdquo; 
which the lexicons define as alternatively a curative medicine, or a 
poison. Indeed, the two meanings are preserved in two modern Greek 
cognate words: ph&aacute;rmakon now means medicine alone, while the 
verb pharmak&oacute;no is to poison. This is the crux of our present 
argument.
<p>

[4] Now according to Derrida, this apparent ambiguity renders the 
meaning of the word &ldquo;undecidable.&rdquo; Let us examine this on two grounds. 
First, within the present context, &ldquo;ph&aacute;rmakon&rdquo; clearly carries its 
positive meaning, since Theuth is hardly going to persuade the king by 
offering him a poison. Derrida realises this, but he wants to argue that 
the other, opposed meaning insinuates itself upon the intended meaning. 
Secondly then, might the word&rsquo;s use in the language settle the question of 
meaning? I would argue that it does, and this is exactly what Derrida is 
constrained to ignore due to his whole approach to language. For the 
apparent double-meaning is not a binary opposition operating solely 
within a closed linguistic system, but is linked rather to features of the 
extra-linguistic material world. As Paracelsus had already said prior to 
Plato, &ldquo;it depends only upon the amount whether a poison is poisonous or 
not&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>. So what 
we have is not a Saussurean semantic opposition within a single signifier, 
but the dissapointingly mundane observation that a small dose can cure, 
while a large dose will poison. As usual, the implicit linguistic idealism 
of deconstruction excludes the possibility of any interpretation which 
refers to our experience and perceptions of an external world, because &ldquo;il 
n&rsquo;y a pas de hors-texte.&rdquo; Thus a word whose meaning is readily 
comprehensible in the context of common medical knowledge, available 
equally to Plato and to ourselves, becomes fissured by paradox through 
the assumptions which deconstruction brings to bear on the text. The 
paradox is not therefore discovered but rather created by deconstructive 
reading of the text.
<p>

[5] So far we have one pivotal example of Derrida&rsquo;s supposed &ldquo;close 
reading&rdquo; proving quite otherwise. Pivotal because this passage supposedly 
lays bare the &ldquo;inaugural moment in the &lsquo;logocentric&rsquo; epoch whose effects 
reach down from Plato to the present day.&rdquo; It would be unlike Derrida, 
of course, to engage in a simple search for origins; what he is claiming is 
not so much that Plato is the creator of the &ldquo;logocentric epoch&rdquo; and the 
source of all its problems, but rather that the <i>Phaedrus</i> passage is 
symptomatic of a kind of necessity imposed upon us by language, 
whenever we engage in the search for philosophical truths. But what kind 
of necessity is this? What are the forces which according to Derrida, 
always already subvert the meaning of texts? By way of explanation, let 
us look at Derrida&rsquo;s next step in his discussion of the <i>Phaedrus</i> 
passage, which introduces the mechanism of intertextuality.
<p>

[6] Derrida claims that the forces of language bring a cognate word to 
bear upon the poison/cure discussion. He claims that this other word, 
which means either magician or scapegoat is the key to this discussion, 
and since words, according to Derrida&rsquo;s post-Saussurean semantics, gain 
their identity and meaning through all the other, absent terms of the 
language, it is of no matter that this word fails to appear in Plato&rsquo;s text. 
A magician, according to the lexicon, can be a user of potions, possibly 
to poison others, while Derrida notes, from a reading of Frazer&rsquo;s <i>The 
Golden Bough</i>, that in the earlier history of Athens, certain persons 
living within the polis would be ejected as a means of averting an 
impending disaster. He elaborates upon this notion of the scapegoat, 
claiming that the word is both within Plato&rsquo;s text, due to the presence of 
the supposedly related &ldquo;ph&aacute;rmakon,&rdquo; but also absent, excluded, 
just as the scapegoat was excluded by the laws of the polis. The word is 
then drawn up into a discussion of the inside/outside opposition which 
Derrida again thinks is pervasive and inevitable within logocentrism.
<p>

[7] I would contend though, that Derrida is again mistaken in a way 
which is symptomatic of his approach to language. You will notice that I 
have so far avoided mentioning the Greek word for magician and 
scapegoat. This is for a good reason. Since Attic Greek in its written 
form had no accents, only the spoken language revealed which syllables 
were stressed. Because of Derrida&rsquo;s charge that speech has been 
privileged throughout the &ldquo;logocentric epoch&rdquo; this issue is of central 
importance. What has escaped Derrida here, is the fact that magician and 
scapegoat were not rendered by the same Greek word, but rather by two, 
and the distinction is only apparent from speech<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>.
<p>

<ul>
pharmak&oacute;s (stress on the last syllable) means scapegoat, 
while<br>
ph&aacute;rmakos (stress on the first syllable) is our magician and user 
of poisonous potions.
<p>
</ul>

<p>Thus the latter is a genuine relative of our original word 
ph&aacute;rmakon, while the former disappears from the picture. This 
provides a neat example of exactly the reverse of Derrida&rsquo;s neologism 
&ldquo;diff&eacute;rance&rdquo;: where Derrida created a word whose double 
meaning&mdash;differance and deferral&mdash;is apparent only in writing, and not 
in speech, here we have a difference in meaning apparent in speech but 
not in writing. This is a nice irony to arise from a Derridean text. The 
importation of the scapegoat, seems designed to raise the stakes by 
introducing a political dimension to Plato&rsquo;s supposed binary oppositions; 
however, Derrida not only makes a very telling error in the process, but 
the importation can only take place by a very nebulous notion of 
necessity and forces traversing language; this is related to his semantics 
of diff&eacute;rance, derived tendentiously from Saussure&mdash;but I shall 
deal with this matter a little later. I might, facetiously, offer another 
example of Derridean semantic defferal: writing, in the myth was offered 
as a gift, but of course in German, &ldquo;<i>Gift</i>&rdquo; means poison, reinforcing 
Derrida&rsquo;s original point. By this means&mdash;admittedly more Yale 
deconstructionist than Derridean&mdash;we can prove anything.
<p>

[8] The <i>Phaedrus</i> is in part Plato&rsquo;s defence of the Socratic 
dialectic method. In opposition to this, he places the rhetorician&rsquo;s speech, 
written out beforehand, which can be delivered by another on a different 
occasion, to an audience quite different from that originally intended. 
There is of course a certain irony in the fact that Plato is himself leaving 
a piece of writing as a hostage to fortune, in praise of Socrates who 
resisted the temptation to depart from spoken dialectics, and so preserved 
nothing in writing; and indeed this irony can hardly have escaped Plato. 
Socrates, in the dialogue, is making a complaint of a very practical 
nature: that speeches already written out cannot answer back, and cannot 
possibly adjust themselves to the prejudices or ignorance of all future 
audiences. There is no binary opposition here, though, because, as I have 
said, Socrates allows for a rhetoric, an art of speech writing which is 
carefully attuned to its audiences&rsquo; needs, not to flatter, but to persuade. 
But of course the dialectical method remains the ideal for Socrates, since 
minds interact directly, and every fallacy, over-hasty conclusion or 
misunderstanding can in principle be addressed immediately by the other 
speakers. Socrates is also concerned that knowledge gained purely from 
written sources will not necessarily be accompanied by understanding; 
the reader may accept the conclusions of a detailed argument 
dogmatically, without following the argument. (This matches my own 
teaching experience, since, for example, a few students in my aesthetics 
courses have been horrified by the notion that the quality of the argument 
is to be valued above the conclusions reached, since they have been 
accustomed to the neat packaging of supposed facts, which can be 
memorised for examination purposes&mdash;in which case, understanding is a 
mere luxury.) This is the kind of practical problem Socrates is 
addressing, and to treat it according to a hermeneutics of suspicion that 
searches at all costs for a privileging of speech over writing seems to 
miss the point, without any substantial gain to compensate&mdash;this is in 
addition to the fact that the alleged close reading turns out to be gravely 
flawed in ways which directly undermine Derrida&rsquo;s deconstructive 
interpretation. To put a contemporary gloss on Socrates&rsquo; argument, we 
might offer e-mail as a form of writing which would completely satisfy 
all his strictures, since the writer can answer back; the academic e-mail 
discussion list, at its best, would have pleased Socrates greatly, and might 
even offer an advantage which he would acknowledge: answers can be 
more carefully framed, since we can ponder over them at far greater 
length than would be tolerable in spoken dialogue.
<p>

[9] So here we have an example of writing which co-incides with 
Socrates&rsquo; discursive ideal. We should also remember that the examples of 
writing Socrates was considering were themselves to be communicated in 
speech, since rhetoric was the topic under consideration. We ought 
further to recall that silent, inward reading is a relatively modern 
phenomenon, which was rare enough to invite comment only five 
centuries ago; even with an audience of one&mdash;the reader alone&mdash;written 
texts were still associated with the speaking voice. The concert platform, 
by the way, displays its own ethic on written music: the consensus since 
Liszt has demanded that a recitalist memorise the score on the 
understanding that only then has the music been internalized.
<p>

[10] Derrida is also misleading in his account of the supposedly canonical 
reading of the <i>Phaedrus</i> which his deconstructive reading is 
supposed to overthrow. The scholarly consensus, according to Derrida, is 
that the Phaedrus is one of Plato&rsquo;s poorest products, either immature, or 
written in his dotage, and in either case not worthy of the same attention 
as most of his other works. This, however, is a travesty of contemporary 
Platonic scholarship, which has established conclusively that the 
<i>Phaedrus</i> is a late work, and it is admired for its literary 
qualities, not condemned. Glancing at the translation most widely 
available in the U.K., by Walter Hamilton<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>, the Introduction explains 
how the seemingly disparate segments of the text are in fact carefully 
unified, whereas Derrida would have us believe that modern 
commentators unite in proclaiming the <i>Phaedrus</i> too haphazard. 
Nor is the writing myth shunned, or regarded as an embarrassment by 
Hamilton. (I might also mention here that the Phaedrus character in the 
dialogue seems to think that Socrates has just invented the myth as a 
colourful illustration of his argument.) It is this largely fictitious 
canonical reading against which Derrida offers his new transgressive 
interpretation&mdash;a dramatic backdrop to be sure, but unfortunately for 
Derrida it is also untrue.
<p>

[11] By way of summary then, Derrida, in his treatment of the 
<i>Phaedrus</i>, first misrepresents the modern scholarly consensus on 
the text; secondly, he declares that his own close reading will overthrow 
this alleged canonical interpretation, by respecting the details of Plato&rsquo;s 
text, but on closer inspection this reading is found to be less than close, 
and subject to external purposes, leading to a reading which the details of 
the text cannot sustain, such as various imposed binary oppositions; 
thirdly, he bases his deconstruction of the text on the semantic 
undecidability of a word which is perfectly decidable on non-linguistic 
grounds; fourthly, he imports another word into the text, justifying this 
strategy on the basis of a dubious necessity arising from his semantics of 
diffe&rsquo;rance; fifthly, this absent word, supposedly a key to the passage, 
turns out to be two words, spoiling the putative relationship, and 
ironically proving symptomatic of a certain blindness in Derrida&rsquo;s 
approach.
<p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>[12] All too briefly, I would now like to present a sketch of Derrida&rsquo;s 
views on language, derived from his peculiar reading of Saussure. At the 
end of his life, Saussure, an historical linguist, presented a vision of a 
new non-historical linguistics which would treat language 
synchronically<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>. Derrida tries to cast 
Saussure as an upholder of phonocentrism, the privileging of speech over 
writing, but this charge is even harder to press on Saussure than it was on 
Plato<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>. For 
Saussure had worked with written texts throughout his working life as an 
historical linguist&mdash;prior to the development of audio recording 
technology, written records were all the historical linguist could refer to. 
Saussure, in his last lectures was, among other things, explaining how the 
spoken word could now find a place in a new, synchronic examination of 
a language, at any given moment in its history, as a system; this 
appearance of speech was a proposed reversal in the practices of 
linguists, and nothing to do with the upholding of an alleged phonocentric 
tradition running from Plato onwards.
<p>

[13] Saussure explored the phonemic level of language in these last 
lectures, and concluded that phonemes belonged to a system of 
oppositions, allowing us to distinguish cat from mat. His daring 
speculative leap was to suggest that the semantic level of language was 
also governed by a system of oppositions, and it was this idea which made 
the structuralist enterprise in the social sciences and humanities possible, 
giving us L&eacute;vi-Strauss&rsquo;s structuralist anthropology and Nattiez&rsquo;s 
structuralist musicology. Saussure was suggesting that words gained their 
meaning purely from an intra-linguistic system of differences, each 
concept gaining its identity from all that it was not, that is from all the 
other concepts. In the hands of Saussure&rsquo;s successors, such as Jakobson, 
this speculation began to appear unsustainable. Jakobson split the 
phonemic atom in the 1930s, showing that each phoneme consisted of a 
number of simultaneous material distinctive features; the science of 
phonetics can describe these features in terms of their acoustics, or in 
terms of the physiological changes in the speaker&rsquo;s buccal cavity. This 
analysis of the phoneme removed the motivation for the oppositional 
model in linguistics and the structuralist enterprise in general, but its 
implications were not immediately felt<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup>. The model of 
syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes to account for the interaction of 
grammatical and semantic features of sentences was found too weak in its 
explanatory powers to cope with many common linguistic formations, 
and by the late 1950s the Saussurean hypotheses had all been tested and 
found wanting<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>; the new model for 
linguistics was provided by Chomsky&rsquo;s transformational and generative 
grammar. (Still more important, perhaps, was the development, since 
Frege, of truth-functional semantics, of which Saussure was ignorant.) 
This revolution in the parent science of linguistics seemed to leave 
structuralism in the other disciplines untouched, even though the 
foundation had now collapsed. Hence the structuralist writings of Nattiez 
as late as the 1970s<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>. Indeed, it was just as 
structuralism in linguistics was collapsing that the francophone world 
chose, perversely to adopt it, so that its final overthrow outside 
linguistics was not due to Chomsky, but rather to the very different 
critique offered by Derrida. Thus we find Barthes in the early 60s 
producing <i>The Fashion System</i><sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>, a largely unread work of 
mind-numbing high structuralism, while by the end of the decade, he was 
subverting his own structuralist past in the seminars which led to the 
publication of <i>S/Z</i><sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>. Likewise, in francophone 
Canada, allowing for a trans-Atlantic delay, we find Nattiez furiously 
back-pedalling during the 80s in order not to appear na&iuml;ve in the 
new post-structuralist environment<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>.
<p>

[14] Derrida, in <i>Grammatology</i>, ignored the Chomskian 
revolution and took Saussure&rsquo;s lectures of 1917 to be the last word on 
language and meaning. Aside from the shortcomings mentioned above, 
this also meant the acceptance of the potentially most misleading of 
Saussure&rsquo;s methodological choices: the bracketing of the language- and 
mind-independent world, in order to present language as a self-sufficient 
system. But once the external world is removed from the account, for 
methodological reasons, it is hard to see at what point it can logically be 
re-introduced. And so we arrive at a kind of linguistic idealism which 
treats the world as a creation of language. While Derrida himself would 
not seem to endorse this doctrine, it is implicit in much post-modernist 
writing in the humanities today. Saussure, in his talk of the arbitrary 
connection between the signifier and the signified in no way introduced a 
revolutionary idea: he is saying simply that the sound of a word has no 
necessary connection with its associated concept&mdash;this much should be 
evident to any child when she first notices that there exist languages other 
than her own. But once this association has been made, the connection 
between the word and the objects in the extra-linguistic world to which it 
may refer is not at all arbitrary. Most literary theorists&rsquo; accounts of 
Saussure are hopelessly confused on this point<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup>.
<p>

[15] Derrida takes as his starting point Saussure&rsquo;s semantics of pure 
difference, which, as I said, leaves out the referential function of 
language. At this point, since Derrida thinks it should be taken seriously, 
I would like to ask just what a semantics of pure difference would mean. 
Take, for example the word &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; in English: its French equivalent is 
&ldquo;mouton&rdquo;; but whereas we have a second word for the animal when 
slaughtered for consumption, namely &ldquo;mutton,&rdquo; the French must manage 
with the one word for both concepts. Now, in a linguistic economy of 
pure difference, we are to understand that whereas we anglophones, 
thanks to our language, can carve up the world conceptually in such a 
way as to distinguish live from dead sheep, the francophone, on the other 
hand can make no such distinction. I would suggest though, that it is far 
from immaterial to most Frenchmen whether the dining table supports a 
live or a dead sheep, just as French farmers seem aware of the distinction 
when they set alight British lorries carrying live sheep. Such are the 
absurdities of a theory which treats language as a completely autonomous 
system. But this unworkable semantics is what Derrida insists on 
employing as his starting point. From there, he generates his favourite 
paradox by showing that meaning is perpetually deffered by the economy 
of difference&mdash;there is no self-present meaning when a sign owes its 
identity to the rest of the system.
<p>

[16] I would like to consider now the textualist strategies of 
interdisciplinarity which emerge from this position, and which pervade 
much recent work in the humanities. The Saussurean exclusion of any 
language-independent reality removes the referential function from 
language, and without reference, truth claims must also be abandoned. 
This blurs all distinctions between literary writing, which makes no 
direct assertions about the world beyond the text, and any writing which 
purports to extend our knowledge of extra-textual matters, whether 
particle physics or music theory. Distinctions between verbal and 
non-verbal artifacts can also be removed, now that language has been 
dispossessed of its referential functions. Thus the inability of music to 
form propositions is irrelevant: it is no more, and no less discursive, on 
this view, than language. All human artifacts can therefore be treated 
within a generalised theory of &ldquo;text&rdquo; without respect to the different 
media involved. Interdisciplinarity is the attempt to realise this project: 
since all is text, the boundaries between the disciplines is illusory. The 
different arts are thus to be treated in the same manner, and the 
differences between the arts and factual discourses are considered 
illusory.
<p>

[17] This has clear consequences for music theory, since the dissolving of 
disciplinary boundaries in favour of generalised text removes all 
justifications for specialist technical knowledge in this field or any other. 
There is no ground for complaint therefore when the interdisciplinary 
outsider encroaches upon the territory we thought was ours, without any 
training in music theory, perhaps without even the ability to read music 
notation, for no technical prerequisites can be stipulated if there are no 
disciplinary boundaries left. Instead of music theory&rsquo;s approach to music 
as an art with its own vast repertoire of techniques, based on its peculiar 
material, sound, the interdisciplinary approach reduces musical works to 
cultural documents. As the psychologist Maslov once said, if your only 
tool is a hammer, you tend to see everything as a nail. Music theorists 
should therefore think again before they join in the celebration of 
interdisciplinarity, since the price of the ticket is ultimately the 
renunciation of technique. While these techniques are individually open 
to interrogation&mdash;witness the growing literature tracing the genaeology 
of Schenker&rsquo;s thought in the work of William Pastille<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> and others, its organicist 
links to the aesthetic ideology in Alan Street&rsquo;s critique<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup>, and the project of 
replacing its methodological foundations, by Matthew Brown and 
Douglas Dempster<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> and many others. All of 
this is welcome, but while music theory can challenge, modify or replace 
parts of its technical repertoire, it cannot survive the removal of all 
specialist technical knowledge.
<p>

[18] This, however, is to look towards the future. Inconsistency can 
sometimes have its advantages, and the consequences of misguided 
theories are not always realised. It is also to pass well beyond Derrida 
into the murkier realms of contemporary academia. What I propose to 
look at now are some attempts by musicologists to deconstruct musical 
texts using similar strategies to those found in Derrida. These strategies 
include the close reading of musical texts in order to find marginal 
elements which subvert the hierarchies supposedly present in the score. 
This accordingly involves the isolation of weighted binary oppositions, 
with a privileged and a suppressed term, which can be mapped onto 
binary oppositions of political import, tracing encoded patterns of 
complicity and subversion in the music. Related to this is the strategy of 
discovering a transgressive element in the score which cannot be 
contained within the frame set by canonical readings of the work, but 
disrupts and places in question the opposition between the inner and the 
outer which sustains the ideology of the autonomous musical work. As 
with Derrida, I shall be examing these transgressive close readings to see 
whether they have textual warrant.
<p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>[19] Susan McClary, in &ldquo;The Blasphemy of Talking Politics During Bach 
Year&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup>, 
provides an analysis of the first movement of Bach&rsquo;s Brandenburg 
Concerto No.5, which seeks to isolate such a transgressive element, one 
that is only subdued just in time for the final ritornello to begin. She 
prefaces this analysis with a denunciation of formalism and then attempts 
to define tonality, linking it to &ldquo;the social values it articulates&rdquo; which are 
thoroughly bourgeois, consisting of &ldquo;beliefs in progress, in expansion, in 
the ability to attain ultimate goals through rational striving in the 
ingenuity of the individual strategist operating both within and in 
defiance of the norm.&rdquo; The route from the musical to the particulars of 
McClary&rsquo;s political reading is obscure. For instance, McClary, like most 
musicologists today, recognises the elaborate hierarchical organisation of 
tonal music; but does this not suggest that tonality upheld the values of 
the aristocracy, or the Church, who, after all, employed most 
Eighteenth-Century composers? Why should we simply assume that 
tonality articulates bourgeois values? The role of the tonic within this 
picture is not clear. Is it an &ldquo;ultimate goal&rdquo; to be attained through 
&ldquo;rational striving&rdquo;? Or is it a &ldquo;norm&rdquo; which the &ldquo;individual strategist&rdquo; 
may often defy?
<p>

[20] At any rate, McClary chooses the Brandenburg Concerto movement 
to demonstrate how her politics of tonality is played out in a piece of 
music from this era. Her reading is of course transgressive of canonical 
readings, which fall within the norms of formalism&mdash;hence the 
&ldquo;blasphemy of talking politics,&rdquo; as she puts it. She characterises the 
concerto as a form which &ldquo;addresses the tensions between the dynamic 
individual and the stable society,&rdquo; the ritornelli representing stability and 
the concertino representing dynamism. In the case of this movement, the 
ritornello ill fits this description, due to its elusive phrase-structure and 
its strange melodic contours (in measures 3,4), but to point this out 
would burden the account McClary wants to give with complications. The 
transgressive element she picks out is the role of the harpsichord, which 
almost succeeds in enacting a revolution, emerging from its traditional 
humble task to overthrow not only the ripieno, but the two conventional 
solo instruments as well. She focusses upon the famous cadenza, in which 
the harpsichord &ldquo;unleashes elements of chaos, irrationality, and noise 
until finally it blurs almost entirely the sense of key, meter, and form 
upon which eighteenth-century style depends.&rdquo; The harpsichord only 
allows itself to be reabsorbed into the final ritornello &ldquo;when the 
alternative seems to be madness.&rdquo; This analysis faces some grave 
problems. Firstly, the harpsichordist was traditionally in a position of 
leadership; the humble role McClary would assign it must leave this out 
of consideration. Secondly, the harpsichord behaves as a normal member 
of the concertino group from the first entry, so that McClary must resort 
to supressing the harpsichord&rsquo;s contribution to stability for most of the 
movement, just as she suppressed the instability of the ritornello. 
Thirdly, and this is most important, the account McClary gives of the 
cadenza badly misrepresents the score: the harpsichord emerges to the 
fore gradually, not violently, and of the sixty-five measures, the first 
forty-one are more placid and undisturbed than any earlier passage. This 
section ends with six bars of dominant pedal, from which emerges a 
resumption of the demisemiquaver arpeggios and scales from earlier in 
the movement. The demisemiquavers proceed for six-and-a-half 
measures before the dominant pedal returns. Of these measures, only two 
and a half contain any chromaticism, and they take the form of a 
chromatic descent in diminished-seventh chords, such as we find elsewhere in 
Bach (the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> Partita, for example). Even during this short passage, the 
rhythm is very clear: the left hand takes the first note of every quaver 
beat, while the right hand follows with three demisemiquavers. Twelve 
measures of unambiguous dominant pedal return after this, and the 
harpsichord cadenza ends with as much decorum as it had begun.
<p>

[21] Another essay of McClary&rsquo;s analyses the first movement of Brahms&rsquo;s 
Third Symphony, a paradigm of Hanslickian absolute music according to 
the canonical interpretations which McClary wishes to challenge<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>. She argues 
that sonata form encodes gender oppositions into its thematic contrasts, 
while the tonality of sonata form involves conflict between Self, 
represented by the tonic, and Other, represented by the key to which the 
music modulates; the patriarchal nature of traditional sonata strategies is 
evident from the purging of the Other which must take place before the 
movement can close in an affirmation of Self. In her analysis, McClary 
seeks to rescue Brahms from the shadow of Beethoven, by showing how 
Brahms subverts his predecessor&rsquo;s patriarchal strategies. You will recall 
that McClary has little affection for Beethoven the rapist, as she once 
styled him in a discussion of the Ninth Symphony, which motivates her 
redemptive work on both Brahms and Schubert. This redemption takes 
place, according to McClary through the treatment of the material 
representing the Other in the recapitulation. Where the exposition had 
moved from F to A, the recapitulation casts the Other, not in the tonic, 
but in D. This strategy, McClary says, wrests the second theme, the 
feminine, &ldquo;from the control of the &lsquo;patriarchal&rsquo; tonic.&rdquo; Unfortunately for 
McClary&rsquo;s close reading, this is one of Beethoven&rsquo;s standard strategies in 
sonata movements which modulate initially to the mediant, so Brahms is 
in fact using Beethoven as a model, and not overthrowing him.
<p>

[22] Finally, let us look at an analysis by James Hepokoski of a scene 
from <i>Il trovatore</i>: the gypsies&rsquo; &ldquo;Anvil Chorus&rdquo; which alternates 
with Azucena&rsquo;s narrative, &ldquo;Stride la vampa&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>. Hepokoski assumes that 
Verdi, in his early and middle operas, employed fixed forms which were 
so firmly established as conventions that they were recognized and 
understood by contemporary audiences. In the middle-period operas, 
Verdi was additionally able to manipulate those forms, creating 
expectations in his audience which could be redirected or frustrated in 
meaningful ways. These strategies served to evoke semiotic complexes 
which traversed contemporary cultural and political attitudes. Hepokoski 
portrayed opera in Italy at this time as an institution of the waning feudal 
ruling class, which was being appropriated by the bourgeoisie to 
legitimate its own world view. While enjoying the prestige derived from 
aristocratic opera, the bourgeoisie also wished to dissolve the former 
grand conventions into the immediacy, spontaneity and naturalness 
promoted by their Romantic creed. Hepokoski takes the French strophic 
form of Azucena&rsquo;s aria, and the Italian lyric form of the &ldquo;Anvil Chorus,&rdquo; 
and maps the resulting French/Italian opposition onto political 
oppositions, such as bourgeois/aristocratic, and cultural oppositions, such 
as natural/conventional. The intermingling of world-views thus resulting 
from the nesting of the different forms in this scena enacts the clash 
between the two social classes vying for power, and reveals their 
common purposes.
<p>

[23] The pivotal use made of Azucena&rsquo;s strophic aria in this system of 
oppositions appears over-ambitious, since a strophic form was used 
conventionally for narratives, regardless of any French, bourgeois or 
other associations this form supposedly carried. Hepokoski&rsquo;s 
interpretation finally comes unstuck on general issue of the fixed forms 
thesis that he depends upon in order to extract his initial binary 
opposition: this thesis altogether lacks support in the contemporary 
literature. The one commentator who mentioned forms&mdash;Basevi&mdash;used 
the word to refer to the constituent parts of the larger forms, spanning a 
scena, which Hepokoski means by the word. Basevi, as Roger Parker has 
established,<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> discussed formal issues 
on an ad hoc basis, and his account compels us to concede that form was 
too malleable and varying to provide grounds for any clear-cut binary 
oppositions. But without these oppositions, no deconstruction arises.
<p>

[24] These three examples are not offered as paradigms of Derridean 
deconstruction, but as representative examples of the use of 
deconstructive strategies in recent musicology. But even if McClary and 
Hepokoski were meticulous in following Derrida&rsquo;s practices, they would 
still face shipwreck upon the issue of Saussurean semantics, which 
Derrida shares with the cruder linguistic idealism of so many in the 
humanities today. As I have argued, the search for binary oppositions 
within texts is without motivation once Saussure&rsquo;s semantics is understood 
to be unworkable. And since Saussure was attempting to found a 
scientific project, he submitted himself, by implication, to scientific 
method, which is fallibilist rather than dogmatic; to respect Saussure&rsquo;s 
historical role is very different, therefore, from nurturing misplaced 
dogmatic loyalty in a theory which was disproven long ago. I have many 
other examples of putative musicological deconstructions which fail to 
live up to their claims, but since the danger of causing offence by 
attacking someone in the audience increases with the number of examples 
used, I thought it would be more diplomatic to reserve these for any 
private discussion which might arise later. In conclusion though, if the 
god Theuth, of Plato&rsquo;s myth, should approach you bearing the gift of 
deconstruction, ponder his claims carefully, lest you receive poison 
rather than cure. Musicology today needs a cure for its overweening 
theoretical ills, but that cure is unlikely to be found in the incantations 
and potions of deconstruction&rsquo;s magicians (ph&aacute;rmakos). If, on the 
contrary, you think I have made a scapegoat (pharmak&oacute;s) of 
deconstruction, you are welcome to place your protest on mto-talk.</p>
