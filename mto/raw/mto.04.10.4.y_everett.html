<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Literary critic Simon Denitith describes parody as a 
cultural form that engages in &ldquo;a battle between popular cultural energies and 
the forces of authority which seek to control them.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Similar to authors of 
literary parodies, Western composers have incorporated parodic devices in their 
works as ludicrous or subversive responses to the socio-political conditions of 
their times. Examples of musical parody in 18th and 19th century music abound. 
Mozart&rsquo;s quotations of Martin and Sarti in <i>Don Giovanni</i> and Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s 
misquotation of <i>The Marseillaise</i> in his 1812 overture combine mischief with 
irony. Stylistic incongruities in Beethoven&rsquo;s late music may be viewed as 
manifestations of romantic irony in the vein of Fichte and Schlegel, exemplified 
by &ldquo;paradox, self-annihilation, parody, and the appearance of the fortuitous and 
unusual.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> In terms of twentieth-century literature, literary theorists have 
hypothesized that the ironic intent underlying parody is an ideological goal in 
its own right. Mikhail Bakhtin, for example, discusses the Russian formalists&rsquo; 
treatment of parody as a genre of double-voiced discourse; his theory of the <i>carnivalesque</i> 
provides a social ground that testifies to the relativity of all languages.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
Linda Hutcheon emphasizes the <i>enunciative</i> contexts by which twentieth-century 
artists and composers have embraced parody from a critical, ironic distance.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p><p>[2] In musical discourse, parody and irony present 
elusive terms that defy concrete analysis. How can parody be systematically 
distinguished from collage, pastiche, allusion, and quotation in 
twentieth-century music? Can literary criteria for parody and irony be 
effectively adapted and expanded toward musical analysis? In an attempt to 
establish specific criteria for analysis, this article expands on Linda Hutcheon&rsquo;s literary theory on parody, D.C. Muecke&rsquo;s writing on irony, and 
music-theoretical concepts and applications advanced by Robert Hatten and Esti 
Sheinberg.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Hutcheon&rsquo;s concept of <i>ethos</i> provides a useful interpretive 
framework for distinguishing the aesthetic motivations that underlie parody, 
irony, and satire, and their points of intersection. I also build on Hatten&rsquo;s 
and Sheinberg&rsquo;s theoretical positions informed by semiotic theories in 
constructing a preliminary typology of parodic devices with application to 
twentieth-century dramatic works. My analysis examines the distinctive parodic 
strategies that give rise to ironic and satiric <i>ethos</i> in selected works by 
Kurt Weill, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Louis Andriessen. In the conclusion, 
further considerations for expanding and refining the typology will be addressed 
in relation to discourses of intertextuality and postmodernism. </p>
<p>[3] 
According to Hutcheon, many art forms in the twentieth century convey irony 
through what she calls &ldquo;parodic transgression.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> For instance, Hutcheon 
invites us to look at a surrealist painting by Ren&eacute; Magritte called 
&ldquo;Perspective&rdquo; (1950), which anthropomorphizes three coffins as human figures 
that look over a balcony. In order to really &ldquo;get&rdquo; the parody, Hutcheon says, 
one has to recognize the hidden or backgrounded referent.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Magritte parodies 
the impressionist painter Edouard Manet&rsquo;s &ldquo;le balcon&rdquo; (1869), a painting that 
features three upper middle-class figures, clad in handsome clothing, in poses 
identical to those of the coffins. The surrealist painter &ldquo;trans-contextualizes&rdquo; 
the placement and perspective of the three figures in Manet&rsquo;s painting and then 
inverts the semantic configuration of the referent; not only is the concept of 
life replaced by death, but a tropological reading emerges as a critique of 
bourgeois society (i.e., death of middle-class lifestyle).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4] In her exploration of the pragmatic functions 
of parody in modernist and postmodernist works ranging from visual art, 
literature, film, to music, Hutcheon construes parody as &ldquo;a structure of 
repetition with critical distance.&rdquo; She distinguishes parody from pastiche and 
collage by foregrounding the artist&rsquo;s self-conscious reworking of the 
backgrounded model that moves beyond mere imitation. Hutcheon introduces the 
concept of <i>ethos</i>&mdash;&ldquo;an inferred intended reaction motivated by the text&rdquo;&mdash;to 
establish a framework for distinguishing the functions of satire, parody, and 
irony.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> First, she distinguishes satire and parody as separate types of 
literary genre with an overlapping <i>ethos</i>. As shown in <b>Figure 1a</b>, she draws two 
overlapping circles: the one to the left indicates S for satire and the one to 
the right indicates P for parody. Second, she denotes irony (I), enclosed in a 
circle with dotted line, as a trope or figure of speech used by both genres to 
mark the difference in meaning that emerges from &ldquo;the superimposition of 
semantic contexts involving one signifier and two signifieds.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> She describes 
this model as three overlapping and constantly shifting circles, whereby the 
proportions of mutual inclusion vary with each text under consideration. Her 
<i>ethos</i> is, moreover, defined by <i>markedness</i> values in which one term dominates 
its opposite by creating a categorical asymmetry.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Satire is always 
accompanied by a scornful or disdainful <i>ethos</i> (and therefore marked) while 
parody is accompanied by reverential, humorous, or contesting <i>ethos</i> (and 
therefore unmarked). Thus if Magritte&rsquo;s intention in parodying Manet is 
satirical in his critique of bourgeois society, its <i>ethos</i> is located in the 
area of intersection between S and P. While focusing on the perception and 
interpretation of the reader (who decodes the encoded text) and the underlying 
social conventions that dictate possible readings, Hutcheon takes care not to 
equate parody with intertextuality, which signifies an anonymous, impersonal 
crossing of texts according to Julia Kristeva.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>
<p>[5] 
First, I define parody in musical discourse as a composer&rsquo;s appropriation of pre-existing music with intent to highlight it in a significant way.  The analyst then determines whether the accompanying 
<i>ethos</i> is deferential (<i>neutral</i>), ridiculing (<i>satirical</i>), or contradictory (<i>ironic</i>) based on how the new context transforms and/or subverts the topical/expressive meaning of the borrowed element.  Specifically, satirical or ironic 
<i>ethos</i> arises from signals that trans-contextualize and invert or negate the topical meaning of the backgrounded referent. In a piece of music, the signals that invert or negate the literal message may be communicated through sung or spoken text, conflicting musical signifiers, and/or affect or mode of delivery.  Second, satirical and ironic 
<i>ethos</i> are distinguishable by means of their structure of ambiguity, i.e., whether a closure in meaning takes place or the contradictory poles of meaning are upheld. This last point requires further clarification. Both Hutcheon and Sheinberg comment on the ethical implication and didactic purpose 
that accompany satire&rsquo;s ridiculing <i>ethos</i>. As a corrective, satire privileges 
one end of the oppositional poles in meaning, while irony retains its 
oppositional equilibrium. In terms of the explicitness of communication, satire 
is more easily recognizable because it tends to rely on an explicit mode of 
delivery that negates the literal meaning: e.g., &ldquo;John is a real tiger!&rdquo; 
enunciated with a mocking tone of voice openly contradicts the assumption that 
John is &ldquo;brave&rdquo; or &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; like a tiger. In comparison, Mark Anthony&rsquo;s 
remark in Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Julius Caesar,</i> &ldquo;Brutus is an honorable man,&rdquo; is ironic 
in intent. A perceptive audience recognizes Mark Anthony&rsquo;s message as a bitter 
refrain that fuses the contradictory messages into a source of semantic 
ambiguity. Irony is communicated more often through implicit rather than 
explicit signals: in subtle cases, the transliteral message is embedded in the 
text in such a way that only the culturally and ideologically &ldquo;competent&rdquo; 
audience comprehends the double exposure. </p>

<p>[6] Hutcheon&rsquo;s <i>ethos</i> offers a useful 
framework for parsing the aesthetic motivations that guided twentieth-century 
composers to adopt various parodic techniques. <b>Figure 1b</b> lists such motivations 
synchronically, although such categories are by no means comprehensive or 
mutually exclusive. One could say that Charles Ives and Alban Berg used 
quotations as part of a narrative program to portray an event, a character, or 
an expressive state. Such quotations acquire new meaning through 
recontextualization, although accompanied by an <i>ethos</i> that falls in the 
neutral, unmarked region. The trend in postwar music is for neutral <i>ethos</i> to 
manifest in the ways in which quotations came to be used as a compositional 
device for fragmentation (Luciano Berio&rsquo;s colossal experimentation within a 
collage of quotations in <i>Sinfonia</i> (1968), etc.), evocation and nostalgia 
(e.g., George Crumb), spoof on Bach (Peter Schickele), or postmodern eclecticism 
(e.g., John Corigliano&rsquo;s <i>The Ghosts of Versailles</i> (1991) or Berio&rsquo;s <i>Un re in ascolto</i> (1984)).<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> A collage of references permeates Alfred Schnittke&rsquo;s
<i>Concerto Gross</i> (1977) or Jacob Druckman&rsquo;s <i>Prism</i> (1980), resulting in a 
stylized web of dense texture without an ironic invocation. Such works fall into 
the non-overlapping (unmarked) region of parody under Figure 1a; I argue that 
the backgrounded referent is trans-contextualized through incongruous 
juxtaposition or superimposition of other elements, yet it does not generate 
expressive or topical opposition in meaning. Thus only the first condition laid 
down by Hutcheon is fulfilled. </p>
<p>[7] In contrast, dramatic works that incorporate parodic devices with subversive or contesting <i>ethos</i> assume a marked quality 
and are strongly polarized in the topical opposition between the foregrounded 
and backgrounded referents. As in the case with the aforementioned painting by 
Magritte, the incongruity in the juxtaposed elements must be accompanied by an 
inversion of topical or expressive meaning (i.e. life turns to death). For 
example, composers driven by a socialist agenda, such as Hanns Eisler and Kurt 
Weill, adopt parody as a device for alienation. Brecht&rsquo;s epic theatrical 
production <i>The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny </i>critiques materialism by 
appropriating the biblical tale of the flight of Moses and the Israelites and 
transforming it into the &ldquo;paradise city&rdquo; of Mahagonny. The play was first 
performed in 1930 as an anti-opera, intended to challenge the audience to 
develop a response other than a merely &ldquo;culinary&rdquo; appreciation of the arts.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
In such contexts, music serves, to a large degree, to critique bourgeois ideals 
through distortion and exaggeration. In <i>Irony, Satire, Parody, and the 
Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich, </i>Sheinberg reveals the extent to which 
Russian formalist writers informed Shostakovich&rsquo;s parodic strategies by treating 
parody as a device for defamiliarization (<i>ostranenye</i>); she considers the term 
&ldquo;existential irony&rdquo; to refer to the composer&rsquo;s embrace of contradictory 
signifiers, e.g., musical correlation of &ldquo;euphoria and dysphoria&rdquo; in Symphony 
No. 10 and No. 13.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> In the last 
two categories, irony functions as a subject of inquiry unto itself, ushering in 
a doubly-coded type of ambiguity characterized by fusion or transcendence of 
contradictory meanings, as will be discussed. </p>
<p>[8] Expanding on Hatten&rsquo;s and Sheinberg&rsquo;s 
analyses of irony, I explore several procedures whereby a satirical or ironic 
<i>ethos</i> is induced through inverting or negating the topical or expressive 
meaning<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> associated with the borrowed model in twentieth-century musical 
contexts. The three constructs are: 1) paradigmatic substitution of expressive 
state (via <i>inverted correlation</i> or analogy); 2) incongruous juxtaposition of 
stylistic elements; and 3) progressive de-contextualization of a literal or 
stylized quotation. These constructs may induce satiric <i>ethos</i> locally or 
combine in various ways to convey an ironic <i>ethos</i> at broader metaphoric 
levels of interpretation. </p>

<p>[9] 
Based on Peircian semiotics and Edwin Battistella&rsquo;s theory of markedness, Hatten 
defines analogy as a figurative comparison that defines any given relationship 
in terms of another: A is to B as X is to Y. As shown in the left diagram under 
<b>Figure 2a</b>, <i>correlation</i> is a specific type of analogy that maps structural 
oppositions onto expressive ones: a literal mapping of signification coordinated 
by the markedness values between two pairs of oppositions.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
<i>Correlation</i> is 
established, according to Hatten, when the modes of signification relate to one 
another via privative opposition, defined by the presence of A versus the 
absence of A. He provides a musical example of correlation in the right diagram; 
the minor/major opposition correlates with the tragic/non-tragic (e.g., galant, 
heroic) since both minor and the tragic affect are marked with respect to music 
from the Classical style. </p>
<p>[10] A simple model for satirical parody can be generated by inverting the 
correlation of major and minor modes and their expressive states, as shown under 
<b>Figure 2b</b>. The inversion of correlation (A:B :: Y:Z) depends-in such a case-on a 
paradigmatic substitution, as in the case of replacing a deceptive cadence with 
an authentic cadence. The audience realizes right away that something is askew 
if a text that describes a tragic situation is correlated with a major mode. 
This inverted correlation between a major mode and a tragic text generates 
satire in Andriessen&rsquo;s opera <i>Rosa</i> (1993). The opera presents a thoroughly Brechtian social critique by parodying stereotypes found in Hollywood films. The 
principal character, Rosa, is an Uruguayan composer who writes Hollywood 
westerns, a shallow and despicable character who abuses his lover, Esmeralda, 
and pays more attention to his horse than he does to her.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 
Examples 1 and 2 show 
how Brahms&rsquo;s tender waltz (op. 39/2) recurs throughout the opera as a central 
leitmotif. The first excerpt (<b>Example 1</b>) depicts the hapless lover Esmeralda singing to her 
mother about how Rosa loves his horse more than he loves her. The literal quotation of Brahms&rsquo;s melody is accompanied by words 
of lament, negatively inflecting the major mode of the waltz. The Stravinskian 
chords (reminiscent of &ldquo;The Sacrificial Dance&rdquo; from <i>The Rite of Spring</i>) 
interrupt her lament to signify brutality and violence. The waltz melody returns 
in various guises to amplify the disconnection between the lovers. In scene 11 
(<b>Example 2</b>), 
the motif returns with an inverted contour, sung by Rosa in falsetto as he 
floats away in the netherworld and sings about riding women and horses. Here the major mode of the melody (now in Eb major) becomes 
negatively inflected when the word &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; puns on &ldquo;nighthorses:&rdquo; the image 
of a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; contradicts the positive signification of a Picardy third. In 
both instances, the major mode identifies with the shallowness of Esmeralda and 
Rosa, while the tragic expressive state is achieved through the superimposition 
of signifiers that negate the positive connotation of the major mode. Multiple 
referents collide, however, in generating a broad range of parodic <i>ethos</i> that 
are deferential as well as ridiculing and contesting.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p>[11] Sheinberg offers another formula for 
structural and expressive oppositions based on equipollent opposition, where the 
correlation is not based on the coordination of markedness, but rather on 
semiotic processes of indexicality and iconicity.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> <b>Figure 3</b> presents one 
model by which satire arises via negation based on this principle. When a 
composer embeds a quotation that connotes a certain expressive state and 
distorts it, its corresponding expressive state undergoes negation by analogy. 
This formula for negation is characterized by a distortion or exaggeration of a 
literal quotation along a temporal axis. Weill&rsquo;s musical setting of Brecht&rsquo;s 
<i>The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny</i> provides an instance of such 
technique. In scene 9, three men sit at a hotel bar and gloat over their 
lifestyle of leisure (<b>Example 3</b>). The exaggerated performance of Theckla 
Badarzewska&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Prayer&rdquo; that opens this scene mirrors the men&rsquo;s view 
of the false paradise. In the absence of dialogue, the excessive ornaments and 
inflated style of playing distort the innocence of the original tune and turn it 
into a symbol of decadence. Somewhat fittingly, the first comment uttered by one 
of the three men, is: &ldquo;Das ist die ewige Kunst&rdquo; (&ldquo;this is eternal art&rdquo;). Since 
this is the only scene where this tune is parodied, the satirical effect is 
localized; the distortion of this tune, nonetheless, presents a poignant 
commentary on the illusory world of Mahagonny. Jimmy, a Christ-like figure who 
objects to his existence in this fake world of decadence, becomes a pariah and 
is executed in the end. Since satirical distortion of nineteenth-century salon music constitutes one of Brecht&rsquo;s stock strategies for ridiculing bourgeois culture, this parodic formula contributes to the trope of anti-bourgeois sentiment in his epic theater. </p>



<p>[12] Finally, <b>Figure 4</b> presents a progressive 
context in which musical signals de-contextualize a parodied element through the 
conflation of two procedures: the parodied element undergoes distortion and is 
then brought into juxtaposition with incongruous stylistic elements. Sheinberg 
cites Debussy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golliwog&rsquo;s Cakewalk&rdquo; as an exemplar of satirical parody; 
the middle section of this piano piece presents a sentimentalized quotation of 
the &ldquo;yearning&rdquo; leitmotif from Wagner&rsquo;s <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> This &ldquo;yearning&rdquo; 
affect is negated by both Debussy&rsquo;s instruction (&ldquo;avec une grande emotion&rdquo;) 
to exaggerate the sentiment and by the eighth-note figure with grace notes that 
&ldquo;mocks&rdquo; the serious affect of the Wagner quotation. In <b>Example 4</b>, the succession of parodied element and contrasting motive are 
indicated as x and y to show how the pattern conforms to the model presented in 
Figure 4a. The exaggerated contrast between the incongruous juxtaposition of 
musical gestures heightens satire&rsquo;s ridiculing <i>ethos</i> at work here. </p>
<p>[13] While satire arises out of 
localized forms of substitution or de-contextualization, the structure of irony 
is embedded within a broader concept of trope or metaphor that arises from the 
global context of a piece.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Hatten explains irony specifically as a trope 
that emerges from the juxtaposition of contradictory or incongruous types, a 
generalized category or concept in music that lies beyond the hierarchies of 
correlation. A preliminary typology may be established as shown in <b>Figure 5</b>. The 
second and third constructs represent procedures for paradigmatic substitution 
modeled on Hatten&rsquo;s and Sheinberg&rsquo;s work in generating satiric or ironic <i>ethos</i> 
at the localized level. The remaining constructs apply to the projection of such 
<i>ethos</i> at a broader, metaphoric or symbolic level. Given x = parodied element, y 
= a different stylistic element, - indicates temporal adjacency or contiguity of 
elements, + indicates a juxtaposition of concepts that gives rise to a trope 
that functions at a broad level of musical discourse, and - indicates contextual 
inversion of the meaning assigned to a given trope. </p>
<p>[14] While the models are listed in the 
order in which they were presented, context determines the structural levels at 
which the <i>ethos</i> of satire and irony are sustained. The previous examples 
demonstrated how satirical effects were generated by means of inverted 
correlation and paradigmatic substitution; however, such localized effects may 
be combined with other strategies to project irony at the global level of 
musical discourse. I&rsquo;d like to turn now to two dramatic works by Davies and Andriessen to show how the composers adopt a combination of these strategies to 
prolong the satiric and ironic <i>ethos</i> over the course of an entire scene or a 
plot. </p>
<p>[15] As one of the Manchester school composers, Davies has exerted a powerful 
presence in the avant-garde musical scene in postwar England. Davies&rsquo;s works 
from the late 1960s and early 1970s, e.g., <i>St. Thomas&rsquo; Wake</i> (1969) and <i>Tavener</i> 
(1970), are characterized by ironic reworkings of medieval plainsong fragments; 
in <i>Missa super L&rsquo;Homme Arm&eacute;,</i> Davies de-contextualizes the cantus firmus by 
progressively splintering it through distortion and magnification. <i>Eight Songs 
for a Mad King</i> (1969) is &ldquo;an extravagant, disturbing portrayal of madness.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
The baritone sings the part of King George III (or perhaps another madman who 
pretends to be the King), who tries to teach his instrumentalists to sing. The 
string and woodwind players represent bullfinches (each confined within a cage 
on stage) and, symbolically, the society at large that mocks the King.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></p>


<p>[16] In the seventh song, the King parodies the 
aria &ldquo;Comfort ye&rdquo; from Handel&rsquo;s Messiah through distortion and exaggeration. 
This effect is hardly comforting. As shown in <b>Example 5</b>, the distorted Handelian 
parody is flanked by foxtrot and vaudeville tunes that reference sin. The music 
oscillates back and forth between tonal and atonal poles. The symbolic death of 
the violin represents the death of his society. The musical style swiftly shifts 
to exaggerated expressionistic idioms of the Second Viennese school, leading 
ironically to the pronouncement of the King&rsquo;s own death. This seemingly absurd 
scene nonetheless gives way to a nuanced interpretation of satire and irony at 
multiple levels of structure. Locally, it is through the strategy of progressive 
de-contextualization that the satiric <i>ethos</i> is sustained. As shown in 
Example 5, 
the Handelian reference x&mdash;the parodied style that is historically 
contemporaneous to the period in which King George lived&mdash;undergoes continual 
distortion (-x). The misquotation of &ldquo;Comfort ye&rdquo; from Handel&rsquo;s Messiah 
alternates with stylistic allusions to foxtrot and vaudeville (y)&mdash;anachronistic 
genres that have their origins in the early twentieth-century. At the musical surface, the progressive de-contextualization of the 
Handelian references becomes the primary vehicle for portraying the drama of the 
King&rsquo;s state of madness. In the process the musical idiom oscillates back and 
forth between tonal and atonal poles. </p>
<p>[17] Perhaps what is provocative about the piece is that our &ldquo;normative&rdquo; 
expectation&mdash;to associate the state of madness with atonality&mdash;is turned 
completely inside out. Davies correlates tonal stability of the foxtrot and 
vaudeville tunes with decadence and corruption, and the misquotation of Handel 
with the King&rsquo;s virtuousness-his attempt to rescue his people in spite of his 
madness. One could argue that Davies prolongs dramatic tension in this scene by 
mapping tonal and atonal references onto two distinct tropological poles of 
opposition (tonal: atonal :: decadence: innocence) and (tonal: atonal :: 
illusion: reality). Thus the borrowed tunes in tonal settings signify the King&rsquo;s 
entry into illusion and madness, while destructive passages in atonality signify 
moments of lucidity and awareness. The King&rsquo;s wish to &ldquo;save his people&rdquo; allows 
him to escape from the illusory state of madness; however, the awareness of his 
condition only leads to the realization of his own mortality. From a broader 
aesthetic realm, madness in this theatrical piece emerges as a trope that is 
doubly-coded. At the end, the audience is left to grapple with the question: is 
this piece about King George&rsquo;s madness or a critique of a society that is in 
itself mad? By portraying madness as a societal phenomenon, the composer tries 
to lift the stigma attached to the individual affliction of madness. Thus, 
framed within a broader hermeneutic framework, the context inverts the 
conventional meaning associated with madness; if the incongruous juxtaposition 
of styles constitute x + y as a trope for madness, its meaning is turned inside 
out. Here, the trope of madness is suggestive of what D.C. Muecke calls <i>double</i> irony&mdash;where the opposition lies not between 
appearance and reality nor individual and society, but rather &ldquo;between two sides 
in which both good and bad are mixed.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> Furthermore, Davies incorporated 
stylistic quotations of the foxtrot as a recurring symbol of corruption and 
decadence in music during the period of the late sixties and early seventies: an 
indulgence in fake nostalgia that has no connection to reality.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> 
By assigning a priori symbolic meaning to stylistic genres, Davies succeeds in 
creating a distinctive formula for expressing irony through parody as a symbolic 
gesture of social resistance. </p>
<p>[18] Andriessen&rsquo;s second opera foregrounds 
dramatic irony as a subject unto its own:<i> Writing to Vermeer </i>(1999), staged in 
collaboration with Peter Greenaway, depicts the domestic serenity of women in 
seventeenth-century Holland in stark opposition to the brutality and violence of 
the outside world. The plot conforms to Muecke&rsquo;s category of dramatic or 
Sophoclean irony in which the characters on stage remain unaware of the prospect 
or &ldquo;irony of fate&rdquo; that lies ahead.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Contrary to the themes of domestic 
serenity featured in Vermeer&rsquo;s paintings, seventeenth-century Dutch society 
endured turbulent political and socio-economic changes. To provide a dialectic 
framework to the opera, Greenaway and Andriessen came up with the idea of 
introducing sudden ruptures or interpolations from the inner world of women and 
children into the turbulent outer world. The dramaturgical design of the opera 
consists of six scenes that contrast the domestic serenity of women and children 
with sudden interpolations into the outer world. Events from the external world 
such as the tulip crash of 1637, street fights between Catholics and 
Protestants, and France&rsquo;s invasion of Holland, are projected onto the stage in 
the form of a running commentary accompanied by filmic images. Though the inner 
world of women is kept apart from the outer world in the first half of the 
opera, the two worlds eventually collide and merge.</p>
<p>[19] Throughout the opera, Andriessen places the text and music in continual 
dialectical tension: while the text speaks of ordinary events in the women&rsquo;s 
lives, the music embodies their unspoken emotions. The composer introduces two 
important devices for the instrumental accompaniment to provide negative 
psychological commentary to the text: the first is the continual infusion of 
dissonances to create a paradoxical &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; to the women&rsquo;s expressed optimism, 
Through harmonizing major themes and motives with poignant dissonances, 
Andriessen infuses tension into the harmonization of diatonic melodies as if to 
forecast the impending doom that besets Vermeer&rsquo;s household. The 
positively-charged themes and negatively-charged harmonization result in a kind 
of musical chiaroscuro (play of light and shadow) without tending toward 
reconciliation. Thus the strategy of dissonance relies on a topical correlation 
established between music and text, that is, text: music :: positive imagery 
(light) : negative image (shadow). </p>

<p>[20] This correlation is transformed and 
inverted in the second half of the opera. The central leitmotif, the theme to Sweelinck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mein junges leben,&rdquo; appears in fragmented and varied forms prior to 
the golden section of the opera where the full statement of the theme 
appears.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> As shown in <b>Figure 6</b>, irony manifests in how the incomplete 
renditions of the Sweelinck leitmotif are associated with positive images&mdash;&ldquo;Saskia&rsquo;s 
bright face,&rdquo; &ldquo;light,&rdquo; &ldquo;sleep,&rdquo; and so forth&mdash;while the complete rendition of 
the leitmotif reveals negative images of &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain.&rdquo; <b>Example 6a</b> 
 illustrates an earlier scene in which the descending melody appears in a 
fragmented form; Vermeer&rsquo;s stepmother Maria and her children sing about &ldquo;seeing 
the light,&rdquo; accompanied by a tonally ambiguous quotation of the Sweelinck tune 
that avoids melodic closure. The moment at which the 
transition from incomplete to complete statement of the theme corresponds with 
the Golden section of the opera (see <b>Example 6b</b>) and, moreover, the cathartic 
moment when the women begin to acknowledge their inner emotions of turmoil. 
Immediately following the filmic projection of street fights between the 
Catholics and Protestants, Saskia, the model, sings &ldquo;Mein junges leben hat ein 
End&rdquo; in full. At a broader metaphoric level, the de-contextualization 
of the Sweelinck quotation affirms the act of yearning as a trope that fuses 
life and death as an inseparable semantic unit. Once the exterior world (x) has 
penetrated the interior world of women (y) at the Golden section of the opera, 
the metaphorical union of x + y is established; the further dissolution of 
leitmotifs past this point signifies the dissolution of (x +y) into an infinite 
chain of negation. As if to complete the process of dissolution, the sung text 
disappears after scene 5, as the Sweelinck quotation undergoes chromatic 
liquidation in the instrumental tutti and dissolves into an electronic &ldquo;echo&rdquo; in 
the postlude to the concluding scene. </p>
<p>[21] In his own writings, 
Andriessen traces his interpretation of irony to Hegel&rsquo;s dialectical theory in 
which every condition of existence embodies its opposite in a state of tension.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> Whereas in <i>Rosa</i> parody 
functions primarily as a satirical device, in <i>Writing to Vermeer</i> parodied elements (e.g., leitmotif on Sweelinck&rsquo;s tune) 
prolong dramatic irony at an implicit, hidden level as a subject on their own. 
Through distortion of leitmotifs and negatively-charged harmonizations, 
Andriessen allows the music to function continuously as the &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; element to 
the sung text. It is the progressive de-contextualization of the Sweelinck 
quotation, spanning the entire opera, that gives rise to and sustains the 
dramatic irony. The continual transformation and distortion of certain thematic 
and motivic elements mirror the fluid and vulnerable conditions of the women in 
the opera. </p>
<p>[22] To 
recapitulate, Hutcheon&rsquo;s literary criteria for parody provide a point of 
departure for adaptation to musical discourse and for establishing specific 
constructs of satire and irony with application to selected twentieth-century 
dramatic works. Expanding on Hatten&rsquo;s and Sheinberg&rsquo;s theoretical framework, the 
analytical constructs and applications introduced here corroborate the following 
characteristics and conditions: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Parody sets up a structural framework that 
marks difference by appropriating the background model or referent; </li>
<li>Parody 
acquires a marked <i>ethos</i>, i.e., satiric or ironic, when accompanied by signals 
that trans-contextualize and invert or negate the topical or expressive meaning 
associated with a backgrounded referent; </li>
	<li>Satiric <i>ethos</i>, through 
exaggeration and distortion, emanates contradiction in topical or expressive 
meaning, yet achieves closure by privileging one end of the contradiction; </li>
<li>Ironic <i>ethos</i> manifests through inversion or transformation of a trope; it is 
distinct from satire in that its structure of semantic ambiguity defies closure; 
</li>
<li>Satiric and ironic <i>ethos</i> are not mutually exclusive; depending on the 
context, satire may operate independently of irony or it may be subsumed within 
irony at a lower level of structure. </li>
</ol>




<p>[23] In summary, <b>Figure 7</b> compares the parodic structure of the four works examined here by mapping their 
characteristics onto Hutcheon&rsquo;s chart of <i>ethos</i> introduced at the 
beginning. Brecht and Weill&rsquo;s setting of Mahagonny can be located in the 
intersecting region between satire and parody. The work exemplifies the use of 
parody as social satire with an explicit didactic message: the futility of 
materialism. In this context, Brecht leaves little room for the type of 
interpretive ambiguity that might hint at irony. In comparison, Davies&rsquo;s <i>Eight Songs</i> 
or Andriessen&rsquo;s <i>Rosa</i> combine localized satirical <i>ethos</i> with a decontextualization 
of parodied elements that contributes to a large-scale tropological implication 
for &ldquo;double&rdquo; irony. Satire becomes a means to an end, as Davies confronts 
madness as a societal disease and Andriessen confronts stereotypes and brutality 
in cinema. Here, the structure of parody subsumes satire as a low-level 
manifestation of irony as a form of inquiry. Lastly, Andriessen&rsquo;s <i>Writing to Vermeer</i> can be 
situated in the intersecting region between parody and irony. There is nothing 
satirical in <i>ethos</i> about Andriessen&rsquo;s later opera that foregrounds Hegel&rsquo;s 
philosophy of irony based on infinite negation. Unlike the romantic form of 
irony, in which contradictory meanings are transformed into a new state of 
transcendence, the oppositional topics remain fused and open-ended. </p>
<p>[24] Further considerations for refining the present typology include, but 
are not limited to: 1) variants that affect the categorization of parody across 
historical styles, 2) aesthetic ideologies that distinguish one type of irony 
from another (e.g., romantic, dramatic, &ldquo;double&rdquo;), and 3) cultural codes that 
dictate the construction of meaning. First, the constructs introduced can be 
augmented and applied more widely to parodic contexts across historical styles: 
e.g., how does a satirical portrayal of Esmeralda in Andriessen&rsquo;s <i>Rosa</i> compare to that of Barbarina 
in Mozart&rsquo;s <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>? Second, further criteria for 
distinguishing different types of musical irony need to be explored. While 
Hatten describes unexpected shifts in musical discourse as an important 
signifier of romantic irony in Beethoven&rsquo;s instrumental music,<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> dramatic and 
&ldquo;double&rdquo; irony depend on the articulation of expressive oppositions between text 
and music. Thus the contexts under which ironic <i>ethos</i> arises in 
instrumental music (also in absence of parody) need to be distinguished from 
those under which it arises in relationship to text and narrative. Lastly, a 
well-grounded interpretation of parody and irony relies on knowledge of the 
composer&rsquo;s intention as well as the social convention and history of reception 
that surrounds a given work. Interpretation of musical parody presents a special 
type of intertextual discourse in negotiating between the composer&rsquo;s intention, 
social reception, and cultural discourses to ground his/her aesthetic 
orientation.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup></p>
<p>[25] However dissimilar in background, Weill, Davies, and Andriessen share 
the same historical vantage point in embracing parodic techniques in order to 
provoke a social response. All three embrace parodic techniques in order to 
provide a musical commentary on the socio-political climate for the arts in 
Western Europe. In the contexts of Davies&rsquo;s and Andriessen&rsquo;s works, parody 
supplants the purity of modernist aesthetic aim while infusing it with the 
avant-garde&rsquo;s power of provocation. In their political engagement and critical 
deconstruction of operatic and theatrical traditions, their aesthetic stance on 
parody resonates with Hal Foster&rsquo;s discourse on <i>oppositional</i> postmodernism or postmodernism of 
resistance.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> Each composer 
favors, however, a particular strategy in order to inject an &ldquo;ironic edge&rdquo; into 
their dramatic works: Weill parodies and distorts familiar tunes to ridicule 
bourgeois sentiment, Andriessen implants leitmotifs and de-contextualizes them 
to create an opposition between text and music, while Davies embeds topical 
meanings in quotations and then distorts them through an incongruous 
juxtaposition of styles. In either case, they establish a dialogue with music 
from the past in order to inscribe historical continuity with tradition as well 
as to communicate a particular ideology. It is through this critical distance 
that these composers mark their differences from within.</p>
