controversial) assumption. This is that Syntonic tuning (Just Intonation) is not&mdash;though often presumed to be so&mdash;primarily what might be termed &ldquo;a performer&rsquo;s 
art.&rdquo; On the contrary it is a <i>composer&rsquo;s</i> art. As with the work of any composer 
from any period, it is the performer&rsquo;s duty to render the music according to the 
composer&rsquo;s wishes as shown through the evidence. Such evidence may be indirect 
(perhaps documentary) or it may be explicitly structural (to be revealed through 
analysis). What will be clear is the fallacy of assuming that Just Intonation 
can (or should) be applied to <i>any</i> music rather than only to that which was 
specifically designed <i>by the composer</i> for the purpose. How one can deduce 
whether a particular composer did, or did not, have the sound world of Just 
Intonation (henceforward referred to as &ldquo;JI&rdquo;) in mind when composing will also 
be explored together with a supporting analytical rationale. Musical soundscape 
(especially where voices are concerned) means, of course, incalculably more than 
mere &ldquo;accurate intonation of pitches&rdquo; (which alone is the focus of this essay): 
its color derives not only from pitch combination, but more importantly from 
the interplay of vocal timbres. These arise from the diverse vowel sounds and 
consonants that give life, color and expression. The audio examples provided 
here are therefore to be regarded as &ldquo;playbacks&rdquo; and no claim is being implied 
or intended that they in any way stand up as &ldquo;performances.&rdquo; Some care, 
nonetheless, has been taken to make them as acceptable as is possible with 
computer-generated sounds.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] During Adrian Willaert&rsquo;s time at St Mark&rsquo;s Venice, from 1527 
until his death in 1562, the sound of his music performed there must have been 
striking and unique. It was remarked upon by a number of commentators including 
Zarlino who called Willaert &ldquo;the new Pythagoras who corrected numerous errors.&rdquo; 
Silvestro Ganassi also wrote in 1543 that Willaert was &ldquo;the new Prometheus of 
celestial harmony.&rdquo; That Willaert labored long and hard when composing his 
music is well known, as is the fact that each one of his singers was required to 
attend regular counterpoint lessons. Since it is unlikely that Willaert wished 
to turn each of his singers into a composer, we might speculate upon his reason 
for requiring them to attend for such regular instruction. So the following 
questions will form the technical focus of this essay: </p>
<ol>
  <li>how did the sound 
world of Willaert&rsquo;s music differ so strikingly from that of other composers; 
</li>
<li>what were the technical compositional challenges that this sound world posed for 
Willaert, causing him to labor so hard to meet them; and </li>
  <li>why did his singers 
need specialized individual instruction in order for them to be able to meet the 
demands of the music they were required to sing? </li>
</ol>
<p>
[2] The answers to all three of 
these questions point inexorably to the fact that the very sound of Willaert&rsquo;s 
music offered something new and exciting when compared with that of other 
composers&rsquo; music. In short, with Willaert&rsquo;s compositions there now existed a new 
soundscape that contrasted with, and was inevitably compared to the prevailing 
and traditional Pythagorean sound world normally assumed by the everyday 
composer, performer and listener. This explains why the compositional methods 
were more challenging, why the sound of the harmonies was so strikingly 
different, and why those singers who were of traditional Pythagorean training 
needed specialized coaching in order to sing a new kind of music to which they 
were not by habit accustomed. </p>
<p>
[3] In my last essay it was proposed that 
Willaert&rsquo;s motet <i>Quid non ebrietas dissignat</i> confirms the above status quo. 
First, Willaert there asserted&mdash;in one single piece&mdash;the coexistence of 
Pythagorean and non-Pythagorean soundscapes. Second, in order to arrive at the 
new (Syntonic) sounds he labored hard to create a sophisticated melodic 
structure that evinced through its Pythagorean application the new Syntonic 
sound world. Third, he then carefully instructed the singer in the art of 
performing with &ldquo;the new skills&rdquo; by introducing to him the new intervals 
required for correct execution. In one didactic composition, therefore, Willaert 
made the following comments: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the non-Pythagorean sound world was new; </li>
<li>it 
existed alongside the use of traditional Pythagoreanism; </li>
  <li>the accomplishment 
of the new sound required new skills in composition; and </li>
  <li>new performance 
skills were also required. </li>
</ol>
<p>
[4] The sound of JI arises from the intervals of the 
tetrachords that are used to construct the Syntonic diatonic scale. These 
tetrachords are subtly different from those of the Pythagorean scale, having the 
superparticular ratios prescribed by Ptolemy for his Syntonic diatonic genus. As 
outlined in my previous essay, these consist of the following rising sequence: 
semitone (16:15)&mdash;tone (9:8)&mdash;tone (10:9). This system is the one described in 
some detail by Willaert&rsquo;s pupil Zarlino.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[5] The compositional employment and control of 
these specific tetrachordal intervals is what determines whether or not a 
composition uses JI at all. As posited in the Abstract above, JI is primarily 
(and structurally) a <i>compositional</i> procedure, and its actual performance is 
then simply a routine matter of realizing the composer&rsquo;s intentions. In some 
cases the intention is clearly the sound world of JI, while in other cases it is 
obviously not. It will become clear in the following analyses that music 
designed for JI has quite different aesthetics from that employing Pythagorean 
intervals, and that such aesthetic considerations bear upon the relative views 
of the musical function of consonance and dissonance. Indeed the very concept of 
&ldquo;in-tune singing&rdquo; is variable and relative. That Willaert and his followers came 
to regard &ldquo;in-tuneness&rdquo; as being a succession of harmonies consisting of pure 
consonances only is clear. But it is equally clear that other composers and 
theorists judged &ldquo;in-tuneness&rdquo; not only as a quality that defined pure 
consonance but also one that characterized accepted dissonances.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[6] The first analysis to be offered is a phrase 
from <i>Ave Maria</i>, the four-voice motet by Josquin Desprez.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> In exploring the 
composer&rsquo;s sound world in order to determine which of the two systems applies in 
this piece, I shall first illustrate the phrase using Pythagorean tuning (which 
tuning I believe to be correct for this piece), and then assess the consequences 
of performing the same phrase using JI. 
<b>Example 1</b> presents the notation, while 
the associated audio example offers a performance using Pythagorean tuning.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> In this example, the normal 
Pythagorean intervals are preserved including the ditone and semiditone 
(together with their compounds and inversions). All major thirds and sixths are 
wide (compared with their &ldquo;pure&rdquo; equivalents) while all minor thirds and sixths 
are narrow. Such intervals, which are, in this rendition, still to be regarded 
as &ldquo;colored dissonances,&rdquo; help to articulate an underlying musical aesthetic 
whose foreground consists of alternating dissonance (&ldquo;tension&rdquo;) and consonance 
(&ldquo;relaxation&rdquo;). The 6-5 chain employed in voices 1 and 3 gives a clear feeling 
of direction and impetus through the continual dissonance of the sixth resolving 
on to the pure consonance of the fifth. The purpose of these &ldquo;colored 
dissonances&rdquo; is, supposedly, to focus upon the ensuing purity of the consonance. 
For a composer using the Pythagorean sound world such dissonances are perfectly 
&ldquo;in tune,&rdquo; and a normal property of the soundscape. </p>


<p>
[7] If, however, they are performed &ldquo;out 
of tune&rdquo; by Pythagorean standards and are made instead to be &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; by the 
standards of JI, something unplanned by the composer will happen to the 
structure: what is known as &ldquo;comma depression&rdquo; will take place and&mdash;as will be 
demonstrated&mdash;this short sequence will fall by an entire semitone. 
<b>Example 2</b> 
shows graphically all the adjustments in pitch needed to achieve total purity of 
consonance. The playback effect of these adjustments can be heard in the 
accompanying audio file. The conclusions to be drawn from 
this are not merely speculative but very practical. While the first 
(Pythagorean) version maintains the pitch exactly, the second (JI) version 
undergoes a pitch depression that is patently audible, severe and irreversible. 
An interesting but (to me) ultimately unconvincing proposal for rectifying this 
comma depression, while still it is argued using JI, was offered by Jonathan 
Walker in 1996.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Here Walker offered two differing versions that purported to 
remain &ldquo;pure&rdquo; in tuning, one that held the pitch and another where the pitch 
dropped. Even though the graphic he provided in version 1 is sufficient to show 
that the effect of his analysis retains most of the Pythagorean pitches and 
intervals he was trying to eliminate, he actually adds to these further unforced 
dissonances by making comma adjustments in one voice that are unmatched in 
others (creating &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; intervals).<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> His biggest misjudgment, however, is the 
assumption that the Syntonic comma could&mdash;and would&mdash;have been used as a 
<i>melodic</i> interval.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Having made this assumption, several of the tenor notes 
held across changes in harmony are inflected upwards by a Syntonic comma after 
half of their written duration. Yet this inflection cannot be viewed as being 
the <i>outcome</i> of harmonic need because the harmony that is supposedly satisfied 
does not exist until the moment the inflection occurs. So the only way a singer 
could accurately judge the magnitude of the change in pitch is by having 
acquired the ability (which was never recognized or needed) of taking the 
Syntonic comma as a <i>melodic</i> interval.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[8] The caption 
for Example 2 (above) deliberately does not use the term &ldquo;Syntonic tuning&rdquo; for 
the very good reason that the example itself does not apply it. Even though all 
the moment-by-moment harmonies are entirely pure, none of them arises from the 
use of the Syntonic diatonic scale. As shown above, this scale arises from 
tetrachords whose rising intervals are: semitone (16:15)&mdash;tone (9:8)&mdash;tone 
(10:9). But a comma analysis of the performance given in Example 2 proves that 
these were not the intervals that Josquin Desprez used. The three-way 
combination of alternating 6-5 intervals occurring between voices 1, 3 and 4 
proves (since even the spurious application of melodic Syntonic commas does not 
rectify matters) that Josquin&rsquo;s entire harmonic structure is based upon the 
(quite normal) presumption that all tones must be of the <i>same</i> size. This 
simply cannot happen in Syntonic tuning, whose structural demands make it 
inevitable that some tones will be major, and others minor. Example 2 does, 
however, show that it is still perfectly possible (for anybody so inclined) to 
remove all the dissonances and fine-tune the harmonies so that they are all 
pure. But this will be achieved at a heavy price. </p>
<p>
[9] As argued in [6] above, 
the musical style of this extract (like that of any Pythagorean harmonic 
structure) embodies by default an element of harmonic dissonance essential to 
the direction (by &ldquo;tension&rdquo; and &ldquo;release&rdquo;) of the musical phrase. This dissonant 
aspect, inbuilt from the moment of conception, cannot be removed. All that 
happens when the &ldquo;colored dissonances&rdquo; are changed into pure consonances is 
that the dissonance aspects that were formerly part of the local 
moment-to-moment foreground are now merely <i>shifted</i> to the global background 
level. So what formerly remained &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; globally (giving pitch stability) but 
was dissonant locally, has now become &ldquo;in tune&rdquo; <i>locally</i> but dissonant 
<i>globally</i>. The extent of this global dissonance is clearly audible and highly 
disturbing since not only does the base pitch of the piece sink inexorably, but 
this sinking (which in only a few measures amounts to a semitone) stems from the 
ever-present local inability of melodic cells that should span a perfect fourth 
to do so. The reason why such fourths are smaller than they should be (giving 
rise to continual sinking of pitch) is because the one element of Josquin&rsquo;s 
melodic structure that cannot by any means be changed is the irremovable fact 
that all tones must be of the same size. Merely making them all minor instead of 
major simply causes the pitch to drop. This is because a perfect fourth, when 
broken into its Syntonic components, still requires at least one major (9:8) 
tone. Even though Example 2 correctly converts all the semitones to 16:15 
(major) semitones, all the fourths are still a comma short in magnitude (because 
all the tones used have become only minor tones). </p>
<p>
[10] It is often mistakenly 
thought that (as in the above 
Example 2) comma depression is the natural outcome 
of singing harmonies that are purely in tune. It is also sometimes argued that 
such pitch fluctuation would not have mattered, and that it is probably only 
something that bothers <i>us</i> since we have become used to fixed pitch standards 
and have come to regard equal temperament as normal. I shall be taking serious 
issue with both of these views. First an example will shortly be given of a 
composition that suffers &ldquo;comma elevation&rdquo; through the misapplication of pure 
tuning. Later a more detailed analysis will be offered from the music of 
Willaert (who, I propose, did specifically write for the sound world of JI by 
applying carefully and rigorously the correct pitches and intervals of the 
Syntonic diatonic scale) to demonstrate the quite extraordinary lengths to which 
he went in order explicitly to assert that the pitch must remain constant 
throughout a composition. For Willaert, in utilizing &ldquo;celestial harmony,&rdquo; the 
universe which gave birth to such harmony was evidently viewed as what we might 
call a &ldquo;steady-state universe&rdquo; rather than one whose shape and spatial 
dimensions could be changed at the whim of the composer or performer. It would 
be unthinkable for him (or any of his circle) to believe that a universal 
&ldquo;natural order&rdquo; had been found, but that its utilization should then disturb 
this &ldquo;natural order.&rdquo; (Such would indeed be a self-<i>unfulfilling</i> prophecy!) 
Pitch classes selected from a fixed (Syntonic) scale were to be used with care, 
but their &ldquo;fixedness&rdquo; was itself part of the &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; of the universe 
that itself provided the celestial harmony that was being borrowed and used by 
the composer. Merely to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; such units of celestial harmony and to 
misappropriate their use so as to create an &ldquo;unsteady&rdquo; universe in which melodic 
fourths were no longer perfect, melodic octaves were too large or small, and the 
starting pitch (upon which was based all the relative &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; pitches of the 
scale) was consistently changing by oppressively audible magnitudes, was not the 
ethos of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; JI sound world. For this reason, Willaert expended much time 
and great care in constructing his music; and he expected his singers (through 
the training he gave them) to spend no less time and care in preparing to 
perform it. </p>
<p>
[11] The technical reason why Example 2 drops in pitch by a semitone 
is simple to explain: because the wrong soundscape has been applied, and all the 
major thirds have accordingly been narrowed in an attempt to provide purity of 
consonance (where this was not originally envisaged by the composer), such major 
thirds have constantly been tuned downwards to close the interval gap. Since 
this is what might be termed a &ldquo;major-mode&rdquo; piece,<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> the major thirds (as shown by the graphic) will constantly become lowered. As 
each settles, it will assert a new base pitch against which succeeding thirds 
will be further lowered in pitch. But a rather different scenario arises when 
the same incorrect soundscape is applied to a &ldquo;minor-mode&rdquo; composition. </p>

<p>
[12] Unlike 
major thirds (which in JI are narrowed from their Pythagorean defaults), minor 
thirds are widened. In the Syntonic diatonic tetrachord, the reason why the 
inner two notes are raised by a comma is not only to narrow the span of the 
major third (e.g. F/A in the tetrachord E-A, where the F is raised along with 
the G) but also to <i>increase</i> the magnitude of the minor third (here E/G). 
Syntonic minor thirds, therefore, are comprised of a major semitone (16:15) 
added to a major tone (9:8). For this reason, when JI intervals are wrongly 
applied to a &ldquo;minor-mode&rdquo; composition conceived for the Pythagorean diatonic 
scale, the pitch will inexorably rise: as each new minor third is deliberately 
(but erroneously) raised by a comma, the pitch it asserts will become the new 
base pitch. Succeeding minor thirds will require further sharpening, which need 
will become insatiable as the composition progresses. To some extent this 
tendency for the pitch to rise will be counterbalanced by the inevitable (but 
equally erroneous) imposition of equal <i>minor</i> tones since it will be discovered 
that when realizing a composition that predicates the equality of tones (though 
conceived by the composer only as 9:8 tones) the only option left in order to 
achieve the erroneous purity of consonance sought will be to render all the 
unassailably equal tones as is they were all <i>minor</i>. This will render all the 
melodic fourths as being smaller then perfect by a Syntonic comma, and the 
octaves too will be smaller than perfect. The only difference between &ldquo;comma 
elevation&rdquo; and &ldquo;comma depression&rdquo; will be that the narrowing of intervals will 
always be from the bottom upwards rather than from the top downwards. The 
overall result, however, will be that the pitch will continually rise. </p>


<p>
[13] A 
clear example of this can be observed in the opening of the motet <i>Tribulatio et 
angustia</i>, formerly attributed to Josquin Desprez. <b>Example 3</b> shows the first 15 
measures, together with comma annotations, and the associated 
audio file 
provides a tuned playback. What will be obvious to any 
listener is that the short extract ends a semitone higher than it begins. The 
only thing that has been editorially applied is Syntonic comma adjustment so 
that every successive harmonic unit is pure. The rise in pitch is immediate and 
its progressive accumulation inevitable. Even after the first four measures, 
where the chord reached is exactly the same as that of the opening, there has 
been a rise in pitch of one Syntonic comma. This can be observed in 
<b>Example 4</b> 
and heard in the associated audio file (which plays the phrase three times in 
succession in order to demonstrate that the rise in pitch is clear, audible and 
inevitable). This immediately audible rise in 
pitch merely indicates what inevitably is to follow. Had the performance 
retained the correct Pythagorean pitch standards and intervals, the pitch would 
have remained constant, and the global dissonance (i.e. the rise in pitch by a 
semitone) would be replaced by the (correct) local dissonances (thirds and 
sixths) thereby restoring the integrity of a dissonant/consonant 
(&ldquo;tension/release&rdquo;) harmonic structure. Such is shown in 
<b>Example 5</b> together with 
its sound file. </p>
<p>
[14] My previous study of Willaert&rsquo;s motet 
<i>Quid non ebrietas dissignat</i> led me to propose in [3] above that the 
Pythagorean sound world coexisted with the Syntonic world of JI. That Willaert 
not only showed an awareness of Pythagoreanism but actually employed it in that 
piece for structural reasons has been shown. But there are other less didactic 
and more functional compositions that demonstrate a coexistence of the two 
soundscapes, and I shall pass on to one such example in order to explore this 
interrelationship. </p>
<p>
[15] Willaert&rsquo;s collaboration with another composer is shown 
in the <i>Vesper-Psalms</i> of 1550.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
In this collection Willaert joined forces with the composer Jachet of Mantua: 
Jachet composed the music for Choir 1 and Willaert that for Choir 2 in settings 
of Psalms that were designed to run continuously by the use of antiphonal 
singing between the two groups. Jachet&rsquo;s setting was of the odd- and Willaert&rsquo;s 
of the even-numbered verses. As such the performances were intended to flow from 
the music of one composer into that of the other without a break. The 
proposition here asserted (that will presently be supported through analysis and 
performance) is that Jachet&rsquo;s music was designed for the Pythagorean diatonic 
scale while Willaert&rsquo;s was for the Syntonic diatonic. In the music of the 
former, therefore, the thirds and sixths function as &ldquo;colored dissonances&rdquo; 
leading to the perfection of consonances of the fifth and octave. These 
dissonances are deliberately abrasive, though given perfect control in a 
harmonic framework that again progresses through the alternation of dissonance 
and consonance. By comparison, however, the sections composed by the latter 
(Willaert) provide a fundamentally different aesthetic that is realized by a 
euphonious flow of pure consonances in which a clear Syntonic pitch matrix is 
asserted and retained throughout while still retaining stability of base pitch. </p>

<p>
[16] Their joint setting of Psalm 109 (&ldquo;Dixit 
Dominus&rdquo;) provides some interesting and simple examples of these different 
methods. Verses 5 (Jachet) and 6 (Willaert) are here selected as an illustration 
of the differences. <b>Example 6</b> shows the two verses in succession as they would 
have been performed without a break. The accompanying audio file provides an 
accurately tuned playback of these short sections. Particularly noticeable will 
be the exceptionally pure consonances that emerge when Willaert&rsquo;s setting 
arrives, and this will inevitably be contrasted with the slightly longer, more 
dissonant setting by Jachet that preceded it. </p>
<p>
[17] It might be thought 
by those who are skeptical that my distinction between the two composers is an 
illusion only, and that my claim to have identified a difference in structure 
and aesthetics rests only upon my having fine-tuned the Willaert excerpt while 
having neglected to apply the same tuning principles to Jachet. In order, 
therefore, to reassure readers that there is indeed a fundamental difference I 
shall now provide a further version of the Jachet setting as 
<b>Example 7</b>, also 
accompanied by an audio file. Unlike the annotation applied to the Jachet verse 
in Example 6 above (which retained a pure Pythagorean tuning, as indicated by 
the application only of plain letters to the notes with no operands or 
suffixes), Example 7 now shows Syntonic comma adjustments. If the score is 
analyzed carefully, it will be seen that all harmonies are now pure: thirds are 
either 6:5 or 5:4, all fourths and fifths retain their purity, and all 
inversions or compounds are of equivalent purity. All diatonic semitones are now 
major (16:15), and some tones are major and some minor. These intervals are 
stable either as harmonic or melodic entities. <i>But they cannot possibly be the 
ones intended by Jachet</i>. This is because the entire extract undergoes, like 
Josquin&rsquo;s <i>Ave Maria</i> (above), severe comma depression. Indeed the movement 
terminates a semitone lower in pitch than it began. </p>
<p>
[18] 
While some readers may still be persuaded that musicians of the day would not 
have minded (as we do today) that the pitch had fallen in this way, I should 
like them to consider the practical implications this would have posed for 
Willaert and his singers. They would be expected to take over with their verse 6 
from the terminal chord of Jachet&rsquo;s verse 5, and we can clearly note from 
Willaert&rsquo;s careful adherence to the Syntonic diatonic pitch classes that <i>his</i> 
sections predicated that starting pitch would always equate with ending pitch. 
It would have been bad enough if this inadvertent comma depression had only 
affected the way in which verse 5 ends (posing the conundrum for Willaert that 
has been identified), but the reality is that Jachet has provided no fewer than 
<i>five</i> such verses, each of which is immediately to be followed by a setting 
from Willaert. Even if Jachet&rsquo;s singers were trained to be sufficiently 
versatile so as to contend with such progressive and severe comma depressions 
over a longer time span (and there is no evidence that they were), it seems 
unlikely that Willaert&rsquo;s singers would have been trained in this way (especially 
since he was meticulous about his pitch stability). I have to conclude, 
therefore, that the portions set by Jachet belong to the Pythagorean sound 
world, and those by Willaert to the Syntonic. </p>

<p>
[19] If (as I believe) this is 
correct, it would seem that both sound worlds still enjoyed a happy coexistence, 
and also that the respective composers did not in any way mind the concurrence 
of differing tuning practices within the same performances.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
The different scales used in these two short sections are shown in 
<b>Example 8</b>. 
That of Jachet remains strictly Pythagorean, while that of Willaert is Syntonic. 
The latter undergoes a change of structure in its sixth measure as the music 
shifts from the initial use of the synemmenon tetrachord, with its B-flat, to 
the diezeugmenon tetrachord where the B-flat is cancelled. The pitches on G 
consequently begin with their Pythagorean values so as to permit pure harmony 
with the raised B-flat; but as the B-flat changes to a B-natural the G is also 
raised by a Syntonic comma to permit pure harmonies with B, E and C). </p>
<p>
[20] Before leaving this setting of Psalm 109 it 
is worth considering the music Willaert provided to the final short verse of the 
doxology (&ldquo;Sicut erat in principio&rdquo;). In this section Willaert demonstrates a 
sophisticated use of comma control more commonly to be found in his longer 
compositions.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> During the 
course of this short movement, what begins as a straight Pythagorean C gradually 
rises in pitch (due to Syntonic inflection) reaching a point where it lies two 
Syntonic commas higher (C+2). Other surrounding pitches are also inflected 
upwards accordingly. But towards the end Willaert cleverly restores the base 
pitch by audible comma control so that the final pitch is again Pythagorean. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 9</b>. &ldquo;Sicut erat in principio&rdquo;, Psalm 109 (Willaert)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="wibberley2_examples.php?id=8&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 9 thumbnail" src="wibberley2_ex9a_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p> </div>

<p>
[21] <b>Example 9</b> reveals the acoustic engineering 
employed. As with other settings of the Doxology, this movement employs canon 
(here between voices 1 and 3). Canonic requirements have posed a particular 
challenge to Willaert in his handling of consonance and comma control, and a 
brief survey of the main events (verifiable from Example 9) can be offered. (I 
shall indicate comma inflection here, as in Example 9, simply by &ldquo;+1&rdquo; and &ldquo;-1&rdquo; 
symbols attached to the tetrachord pitches. Where a note is inflected upwards or 
downwards by 2 commas, this will be shown as &ldquo;+2&rdquo; or &ldquo;-2.&rdquo;) </p>
<p>
[22] The movement begins with the meson 
tetrachord pitches E-1/F/G/A-1 where the outer notes are lowered by a comma. 
Contiguous with this is the diezeugmenon tetrachord whose pitches are 
B-1/C/D/E-1 which has the same disposition of intervals. When the canonic voice 
enters in measure 2, there is a subtle change in pitch classes whereby the first 
of the above tetrachords (meson) now is presented as E/F+1/G/A. As the &ldquo;F+1&rdquo; 
pitch enters, although it forms a perfect consonance there is an audible comma 
cross-relation.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> As the music progresses, a subtle change in pitch classes is 
now applied to the diezeugmenon tetrachord so that by measure 6 the pitches have 
become B/C+1/D/E (all pitches except the D having been raised by a Syntonic 
comma). This facilitates harmonic and consonance stability with the changed note 
patterns established for the meson tetrachord. But these changes now bring about 
further alterations to the pitches of the meson tetrachord (because of the new 
presence of &ldquo;C+1&rdquo;) whose notes are now E/F+1/G+1/A. This has now introduced a 
&ldquo;G+1&rdquo; pitch class (needed to harmonize with the previously-introduced &ldquo;C+1,&rdquo; 
which in turn had been applied because of the previous &ldquo;F+1&rdquo;).<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
This sharpwards movement continues one stage further because Willaert at measure 
9 changes the harmony from a prevailingly &ldquo;minor mode&rdquo; euphony to a new &ldquo;major 
mode&rdquo; one. In asserting a major chord on &ldquo;G+1,&rdquo; Willaert now has to apply the 
new &ldquo;D+1.&rdquo; Furthermore in measure 11 Willaert reverts to a &ldquo;minor mode&rdquo; euphony 
based upon his most recent &ldquo;D+1&rdquo; pitch class. In this harmony, the &ldquo;F+1&rdquo; first 
introduced in measure 3 must now be further raised to become &ldquo;F+2,&rdquo; while also 
the long-established &ldquo;A&rdquo; has to be inflected upwards to &ldquo;A+1.&rdquo; One further stage 
in the rising pitch inflection still has to take place: in measure 12 the 
already-present &ldquo;C+1&rdquo; has to be raised to become &ldquo;C+2&rdquo; to provide harmony with 
the now-established &ldquo;F+2.&rdquo; By measure 14, therefore, all starting pitches have 
been raised, some by up to two commas.</p>
<p>
[23] The technical challenge for Willaert is now to establish, from this point, 
a way to steer the music back to its base pitch while still maintaining the 
discipline of canonic writing and also preserving absolute purity of consonance 
at all times. One further significant&mdash;but utterly decisive&mdash;&ldquo;comma control 
point&rdquo; is all that is needed, and Willaert supplies this with effortless skill 
and economy in measure 15. Having there arrived (beat 2) at the chord 
D+1/F+2/A+1, Willaert now asserts a further comma control point (beat 4) whereby 
voice 1 descends to G+1 as voice 3 rises to E (both notes having thereby been 
restored to their former pitches) with voice 2 taking C+1 (also restored in 
pitch). Again there is a slight (but indirect) &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; as voice 2 descends from 
F+2 to C+1 (being a slightly widened fourth), but this melodic move is a quite 
straightforward result of the provision of pure consonance against the pitches 
of the other two voices. The movement can be heard with the tunings described 
above in the audio file for Example 9.</p>
<p>
[24] Willaert in this piece has therefore 
demonstrated how the pure tuning that arises from syntonically-disposed 
tetrachords brings about natural variations in and further developments to these 
tetrachords as the music created unfolds. He has also shown that the composer&rsquo;s 
job is not only to utilize the logical changes that occur to these patterns, but 
also actively to exercise control over such changes so as to maintain a 
universal (for the piece) pitch standard. This base pitch standard can perhaps 
be viewed as the &ldquo;universal magnitude&rdquo; within and from which the &ldquo;celestial 
harmony&rdquo; emanates. But the subtle changes and inflections of pitch classes 
required to fulfill this ideal are not likely to be immediately obvious to 
persons other than the composer who devised them. For this reason we may infer 
that the real purpose in requiring all his singers at St Mark&rsquo;s Venice to attend 
regular instruction in counterpoint was not for Willaert to teach them how to 
compose, but rather to coach them in the performance requirements of the 
specific pieces that he provided for them to sing. </p>
<p>
[25] As a conclusion, the 
influence of Willaert upon his pupils&mdash;already noted with Zarlino&mdash;must be 
further emphasized. For this purpose a short section from a Mass by Cipriano de 
Rore will be examined. Through this example it will be shown how a composer, in 
using the simplest Syntonic scale, can utilize the given pitches so as to 
produce a flowing and harmonious counterpoint in which all consonances remain 
pure. </p>

<p>
[26] <b>Example 10</b> shows an unannotated short score of the section &ldquo;Et 
resurrexit&rdquo; from the Credo of Rore&rsquo;s <i>Missa a note negre [Tout ce qu&rsquo;on peut en 
elle voir]</i>. The scale pitches make use of the following three tetrachords (with 
octave duplications) given the upward comma inflections indicated by &ldquo;+&rdquo; to the 
notes concerned: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>Meson tetrachord: E/F+/G/A <br>
synemmenon tetrachord: A/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>+/C+/D

</blockquote><p>
Since the synemmenon tetrachord (as 
opposed to the Diezeugmenon) is specified by the 1-flat signature as being the 
default, Rore (like Willaert) keeps the pitch of G in the Meson tetrachord at 
its Pythagorean position (thereby reversing the position of the major and minor 
tone in this tetrachord). This enables pure consonances to be used against D, 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>+ and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>+, but inhibits the use of consonances on C+ against which the G would 
form a &ldquo;wolf.&rdquo; Rore seems deliberately to avoid &ldquo;C chords,&rdquo; although measure 13 
begins with such a chord from which the G is omitted. Measure 24 does however 
show a rare (for this piece) use of a full &ldquo;C chord,&rdquo; and it is certain that 
here the default C+ would have been lowered to C so as to provide a pure 
compound third with the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>+ introduced in voice 1. This would also remove the 
&ldquo;wolf&rdquo; that would have occurred with the G in voice 3. So even in such a simple 
piece there is evidence of the ever-present need to apply temporary changes to 
default pitches. Even though such a need is minimal in this movement, it 
demonstrates that a correct cognition and execution of the structure demands a 
high level of skill and proficiency on the part of the singer.</p>

inflection: each pitch is indicated by its letter name followed by a suffix 
consisting of an operand and a number. The notation &ldquo;G&rdquo; indicates the pitch of 
&ldquo;Pythagorean G&rdquo; (in any octave); while the notation &ldquo;G-1&rdquo; indicates &ldquo;Pythagorean 
G lowered by a Syntonic comma.&rdquo; In other cases the notation &ldquo;C+1&rdquo; will indicate 
&ldquo;Pythagorean C raised by a Syntonic comma,&rdquo; while the notation &ldquo;E-2&rdquo; will 
indicate &ldquo;Pythagorean E lowered by two Syntonic commas.&rdquo; The purpose in using 
this notation is both analytic and functional. Not only does it enable each 
pitch to be understood in relation to the Pythagorean default against which it 
was deemed to exist in the world of JI, but it also instructs the computer 
program that generates the Audio files to provide exactly the correct pitch for 
the particular note employed. These pitches have been calibrated with 
mathematical precision, and when a comma analysis is undertaken, using this 
method of annotation, the results are given automatic and accurate playback 
through the computer program. A technical account of this process will be 
offered in a future article, together with a tool that will enable readers to 
generate accurate tuning through their own MIDI systems.<br><a href="#FN4REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN5">5.</a> Jonathan Walker, &ldquo;Intonational Injustice: A Defense of

fifth, Walker&rsquo;s use of B-flat/F+ (in measure 48) injects an unacceptable and 
severe &ldquo;wolf.&rdquo; The same combination occurs also in measures 49 and 51. In 
measure 49, Walker not only places an F+ against a B-flat, but also adds a D- in 
voices 1 and 2. While the use of D- creates a pure 5:4 third with the B-flat, 
the also-present F+ is wildly dissonant against both. While the combination of 
F/D- would have provided a pure 5:3 major sixth (being narrower by a Syntonic 
comma than its dissonant Pythagorean equivalent) the combination F+/D- actually 
prescribed narrows the interval by a further Syntonic comma creating thereby a 
double dissonance with the surrounding voices.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> No theorist even from the ancient world ever considered 
an interval as small as a comma (of any kind) to be melodic, and even

the singers would need to engage in a game of &ldquo;Deaf Man&rsquo;s Bluff.&rdquo; In this game, 
the singer of one voice would need to know in advance against which notes in 
another voice he should&mdash;in order to remain in tune with them&mdash;deliberately <i>avoid</i> singing in tune, 
because he will have been persuaded (in rehearsal) that the singer of the other 
voice will actually be intending to change the pitch of the note heard in such a 
way that if he <i>does</i> sing in tune against it he will then be &ldquo;out of tune.&rdquo; All 
parties will also need to have been convinced that one (or more) of them was 
actively capable of singing a melodic Syntonic comma, and that the others were 
able to achieve the even more complex feat of <i>imagining in advance</i> what the 
effect of this will be so that they can then pitch their own notes accordingly 
in order to ensure that they all end up in tune. Since the last person to be 
considered during this entertainment is the <i>composer</i>, I would suggest 
that such anarchy has no connection whatsoever with the proper conceptual 
creation and execution of Syntonic tuning.<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN9">9.</a> I mean nothing more by this term than would reasonably

analysis reveals that the base pitch will frequently but temporarily rise or
