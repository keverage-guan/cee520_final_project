<p>Willaert&rsquo;s 
musical setting of the above portion of Horace&rsquo;s Epistle begins with a 
rhetorical question: &ldquo;What cannot be accomplished through drinking?&rdquo; The 
rhetoric is reaffirmed by the remaining lines that merely give a list of 
positive attainments that can (as opposed to ones that cannot) be achieved 
through the wine cup. Ever since this composition was first discussed by Spataro 
and Aron in 1524, then subsequently by Artusi in 1600, and in more recent years 
by Levitan, Lowinsky, Bent and others, one question seems to remain essentially 
rhetorical: why did Willaert compose this piece, and what was he trying to 
demonstrate? Explanations as to how his notation should be read and interpreted 
have been advanced, but none of these stems directly from a clearly-perceived 
compositional objective. The piece has thus been viewed more as an interesting 
curiosity than as a creation that asserts its own objective agenda through which 
the curiosities identified could be explained. That, as suggested by the text, 
the composition &ldquo;reveals secrets&rdquo;, &ldquo;fulfils hopes&rdquo;, &ldquo;removes the burden from 
worried minds&rdquo; and &ldquo;teaches new skills&rdquo; will become clear. This essay will 
assert, through analysis and theory, that the question &ldquo;why did Willaert compose 
this piece?&rdquo; is by no means a rhetorical one, but one that requires an answer. 
In providing an answer the essay will reveal the technical means through which 
the objective was achieved. The understanding of that objective&mdash;and its 
technical attainment&mdash;will lead to a more wide-ranging reappraisal of 
Willaert&rsquo;s compositional processes and his unique sound world.</p></font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] It is a double irony that Artusi&rsquo;s discussion of 
Willaert&rsquo;s secular motet &ldquo;Quid non ebrietas dissignat?&rdquo; was offered in a polemic 
book extolling what he considered to be the superior virtues of the old music as 
opposed to the inferiority of the modern (especially that of Monteverdi).<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
The double irony is that not only was it through this discussion that Willaert&rsquo;s 
composition was preserved at all, but also it seems that the piece (despite 
having been written no fewer than eighty years earlier) was actually too 
advanced and sophisticated for Artusi properly to understand it. </p>
<p>
[2] Before examining the piece, and briefly reviewing some of the ideas it has 
generated, a short account of its notable peculiarity will be offered. Artusi 
offered only two untexted voices&mdash;Cantus and Tenor&mdash;although Aron considered 
that these formed two lines only of what he judged to be a four-voice 
composition.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Lowinsky published a surviving printed Altus voice (with text), 
and provided an edition of the now three extant lines to which he added an 
editorial Bassus.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The Tenor voice (only) progresses flatwards by the successive 
introduction of flats on B, E, A, D, G and finally C. After having reached 
C-flat (at the exact halfway point) the remaining notes of the Tenor have to be 
performed one degree lower in pitch than they appear visually. Eventually the 
Tenor comes to rest on what looks like E while the Cantus cadences unambiguously 
on D. All writers from earliest times to the present are firmly agreed (for 
obvious reasons) that the two notes must form a final octave, and that whatever 
the last note of the Tenor may look like it must definitely actually sound as D. 
The question that has therefore exercised all minds is how the second half of 
the Tenor (from the note that follows the C-flat) should be read, understood and 
performed.</p>
<p>
[3] Inevitably it is this apparent subjectivity and uncertainty that has aroused 
differing views and solutions. Levitan pointed out that Artusi believed that the 
composition should be sung in equal temperament since he (Artusi) observed that 
Spataro (albeit disapprovingly) considered C-flat as being the same as paramese 
(i.e. B-natural).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Lowinsky, in his edition and discussion of the piece, 
concurred with the view of an intended equal-temperament performance. On the 
other hand, Bent rejected this view and saw the piece as an exercise in 
solmization and <i>musica ficta</i>.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Her views have been echoed by Dorothy 
Keiser<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> and Rob Wegman,<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> and the latter has published an analysis seeking to 
demonstrate that the Tenor completes a circumnavigation of the Guidonian Hand. 
The former, too, views the composition in relation to the recent 
circumnavigation of the globe in 1492. Nonetheless there is a persistent 
alternative view that the intended sound world was that of equal temperament, 
the peculiarity and ambiguity of the notation seemingly reflecting this.</p>
<p>
[4] This 
essay will now posit a very different analysis and rationale that asserts the 
following: a) any supposed intellectual or causal connection with hexachord 
theory and solmization is misguided and actually leads to an improper 
understanding and realization of the piece; b) the presumption of equal 
temperament is misplaced and alien to the composer&rsquo;s thinking and expectations; 
c) attempts to implant a motive for composing the motet by making allusions to 
&ldquo;global circumnavigation&rdquo; (or other extraneous events) are both unnecessary and 
indicative of a failure to have understood Willaert&rsquo;s real (and indeed 
transparent) motive for composing the piece in the way he did; and d) subjective 
decisions about the performance of the second half of the Tenor melody are 
completely unnecessary because Willaert has&mdash;in reality&mdash;identified 
unambiguously and clearly the exact pitch (accurate to within the value of a schisma) of every single note he has presented, together with all the melodic 
intervals required. </p>
<p>
[5] That Spataro could not understand Willaert&rsquo;s purpose is 
shown in his condemnation of the composer&rsquo;s apparently ill-judged assumption (as 
Spataro saw it) that the final note of the Tenor could form an octave with the 
Cantus D: Spataro went to pains to complain that when E is flattened to E-flat 
the pitch is lowered by a major semitone. When it is again lowered by a further 
flat, the pitch is depressed by a further major semitone. Having measured on his 
monochord the position of E lowered by two major semitones, Spataro was able 
correctly to observe that the resulting pitch was lower than D by a Pythagorean 
comma.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> This observation indicates (perhaps unsurprisingly) that Spataro was 
making the assumption that Willaert&rsquo;s musical judgments were (or should at all 
have been) Pythagorean. As will presently be demonstrated, this assumption is 
only partly true. The reality is that Willaert&rsquo;s thinking is deliberately 
Pythagorean only up until the arrival of the C-flat, but thereafter it is 
deliberately Ptolemaic. The following analysis will show that the very purpose 
in constructing the Tenor so as to reach Pythagorean C-flat is to teach singers 
a method of attaining&mdash;within their own old-fashioned and limited Pythagorean 
framework&mdash;the pure major (5:4) and minor (6:5) thirds characteristic of 
Ptolemy&rsquo;s tetrachords. In order for this to be accomplished by singers who are 
unused to producing Ptolemaic intervals, Willaert has constructed a Pythagorean 
matrix whereby the desired 5:4 major third G-B (with the B lowered by a comma) 
is arrived at by replacing the B with a C-flat (a B would have been only a minor 
semitone lower than C, but C-flat lies a <i>major</i> semitone lower in pitch). The 
Tenor note that follows the C-flat is sung as F-flat, and again this now stands 
in place of an E lowered by a comma that would form a 5:4 major third with C. 
The remainder of the Tenor proceeds exactly with the tones and semitones 
literally indicated in the notation, but all now flattened by unnotated <i>musica 
ficta</i>. The result of reading all the flats that exist, but applying a further 
flattening of pitch by a major semitone each time, further extends this 
narrowing of interval (in relation to the Cantus) by a comma. Willaert&rsquo;s Tenor, 
therefore, requires the use of what might be termed &ldquo;double <i>ficta</i>&rdquo;: 
the first layer is provided in the notation of the first half by the written 
flats, while the second layer is then added in the second half by the singer to 
the still-present first layer, but without further notation. The first layer of 
flats is &ldquo;written&rdquo;, while the second layer is merely &ldquo;performed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
[6] A clear understanding of Willaert&rsquo;s design 
and execution is (as suggested above) actually hindered if a hexachord-based 
view is assumed. The reasons why this deduction is inapplicable are simple to 
explain. Hexachords are built only from four identical tones (9:8) separated by 
an intervening minor semitone (256:243); but Ptolemaic Syntonic tetrachords&mdash;as 
will be illustrated presently&mdash;comprise not only two tones of differing size 
(9:8 and 10:9) but also a single <i>major</i> semitone (16:15). Normal hexachords 
therefore cannot provide a basis for the cognition and accurate pitching of 
tones of differing size, or of semitones of the correct size (in Ptolemaic 
terms). A more obvious reason why hexachord evaluation is inappropriate lies, 
however, in the fact that Willaert has used only a tetrachord matrix as the 
structural means of attaining the desired Ptolemaic consonances. This structure 
may be briefly explained and exemplified. </p>
<p>
[7] A diatonic tetrachord, whether 
Pythagorean or Ptolemaic, is a four-note cell comprising the following rising 
intervals: semitone-tone-tone. Their disposition is regularly described by early 
theorists as follows: when two adjacent tetrachords fill out an octave they are 
disjunct (i.e. they are separated by a further tone, such as in the 
configuration E-A/B-e which fills the octave E-e but in so doing adds the extra 
tone A-B in the middle); but when two tetrachords span only a seventh they are 
conjunct (i.e. B-E/E-A, where the heptachord B-A is spanned by two conjoined 
tetrachords which share the same common note E, termed <i>synaphe</i>). Whether 
tetrachords are conjoined or disjoined, the resulting melody is diatonic.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> </p>

[8] While Willaert&rsquo;s Tenor, therefore, is no less diatonic than his Cantus, its 
structure is very different. This is because the first half of the Tenor (unlike 
the Cantus) disposes its diatonic tetrachords heptachordally, as shown in
<b>Example 1</b>. Here the standard tetrachord scales are 
displayed first, showing the Hypaton and Meson conjoined tetrachords (with a <i>synaphe</i> 
on E) and then respectively the added Diezeugmenon (i.e. &ldquo;disjoined&rdquo;) with its 
disjunction (A-B) and synemmenon (i.e. &ldquo;conjoined&rdquo; on A) tetrachords. The former 
spans an octave (E-e), while the latter a seventh (E-d). </p>
<p>
[9] The second system, 
however, shows how Willaert structurally attains his C-flat by constructing a 
series of seven tetrachords, all of which are now conjoined. This forms a series 
of overlapping pairs, each of which spans a heptachord, and each successive one 
adds a further flat in the series. Each extra flat asserts that the note which 
lies a semitone below functions as a <i>synaphe</i>, and the consequent assertion of 
each new point of conjunction (&ldquo;coniuncta&rdquo;) is indicated in the graphic by a 
number from 1 to 6. </p>
<p>
[10] The purpose of each new flat, then, is to convert an 
expected point of disjunction into a new point of conjunction. First, the <i>disiuncta</i> 
D-E (within the tetrachord matrix A-D/E-A, including the B-flat) is converted to 
a new <i>coniuncta</i> by the arrival of E-flat (now causing a heptachordal 
disposition of the tetrachords A-D/D-G, including the previous B-flat and now 
the new E-flat). This process accumulates as each new flat in the series is 
created by each new <i>coniuncta</i>. When these seven tetrachords are performed with 
standard Pythagorean intervals, the C-flat inevitably reached now lies a comma 
lower in pitch than the note B-natural (which it replaces harmonically). This is 
because Pythagorean B-natural lies only a minor semitone lower in pitch than C, 
while Pythagorean C-flat is a <i>major</i> semitone lower. The difference between the 
two semitones is a Pythagorean comma. The effect of this comma inflection is to 
change the diatonic tuning from Pythagorean to Syntonic (even though the 
performance has been attained through the strict application of Pythagorean 
intervals). </p>
<p>
[11] As will be shown below in [19] - [21], the Ptolemaic (syntonic 
diatonic) and Pythagorean (diatonic) scales are what might be termed &ldquo;closed&rdquo; 
and entirely separate entities. The former achieves greater consonance by 
restricting its tetrachordal intervals to superparticular ratios, and this 
yields major semitones (16:15) and larger minor thirds (6:5), together with 
smaller major thirds (5:4). The latter uses minor semitones (256:243), narrower 
minor thirds (32:27) and wider major thirds (81:64). In effect the two systems, 
while using identical tetrachord constructions (in which identical Classical 
names are applied) provide differing tunings. The outer two notes of all 
tetrachords retain the pitches common to both systems, but the inner pairs 
differ. The inner notes of tetrachords in the Ptolemaic scale are exactly a 
syntonic comma higher in pitch than the corresponding notes in the Pythagorean 
scale, and this small but crucial difference eliminates the harshness (by 
syntonic standards) of the Pythagorean thirds and sixths, thereby making the 
purity of their consonance match that of the fourths, fifths and octaves. But 
&ldquo;in-tuneness&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;being in perfect consonance&rdquo; because 
dissonances must also be in tune (even though they are deliberately dissonant). 
A conflict therefore arises between the syntonicist&rsquo;s view of &ldquo;in-tuneness&rdquo; 
(predicated on the assumption that all harmonies will be purely consonant) and 
that of the Pythagoreans (who are still happy to recognize the impurity of 
thirds and sixths which their theorists continue routinely to describe as &ldquo;colored 
dissonances&rdquo;). How, therefore, might a syntonically-disposed composer set about 
providing a didactic piece of vocal music so carefully designed that even a 
Pythagorean-trained singer would a) be compelled (despite rather than because of 
his training) to find himself singing&mdash;unexpectedly&mdash;purely in tune (by <i>syntonic</i> 
rather than Pythagorean standards), b) find the experience so overwhelming both 
in its novelty and effect that he might immediately wish to continue the 
pleasure, and c) be instantly rewarded by a composition that&mdash;from the very 
moment of syntonic enlightenment&mdash;then carefully steers him instructively so as 
to achieve the desired goal? </p>

<p>
[12] The proposition of this essay (indicated in 
its title) is, of course, that this indeed was Willaert&rsquo;s explicit objective, 
and a harmonic and acoustic analysis will in due course be offered to support 
this proposition. In the meantime consideration must be given to the technical 
manner in which Willaert could have reconciled the two seemingly separate tuning 
systems so that a transition from one (Pythagorean) to the other (Syntonic) 
would be simple, inevitable and irreversible. Only under these conditions could 
the composer achieve such tight control that the performer would (however 
innocently and unknowingly) inevitably move from one performance practice to 
another. As signaled above, the arrival at C-flat (thereafter to be used as a 
substitute for B-natural) provides the earliest opportunity within the 
Pythagorean system to provide a pitch that in any way equates with a 
syntonically tuned third or sixth. (All other similarly flattened notes lie even 
further flatwards in the chain.) This clear point of intersection, attained at 
the exact halfway point in the composition, marks the final stage in the 
flatwards movement of the Tenor, and also the point of termination in the 
application new notated flats. <i>Pythagorean C-flat now equates with syntonically-tuned 
B-natural, as does the ensuing performed (but unnotated) F-flat with 
syntonically-tuned E.</i> While, therefore, the base pitch has remained entirely 
constant, the tuning parameters have now changed. The Pythagorean singer, in 
carefully placing his Pythagorean pitches relative to each other, has now 
(thanks only to Willaert) actually begun to sing <i>syntonically.</i> Willaert has 
thereby achieved something comparable acoustically with what Leonardo da Vinci 
attempted graphically in his <i>Vitruvian Man</i> when he squared the circle. The 
circle that Willaert has squared is a &ldquo;tuning circle&rdquo;, but as with Leonardo&rsquo;s 
essay what is unimportant is that the squaring is not absolutely accurate. 
Willaert&rsquo;s notated C-flat is in fact accurate in absolute pitch to within the 
very small interval of a schisma (being the minute difference between the 
Pythagorean and Syntonic commas&mdash;approximately 2 cents). This small discrepancy 
is illustrated in <b>Example 2</b> and its associated
audio file. While the 
first simultaneity here is a perfectly acceptable pure compound major third, as 
the C-flat move fractionally higher to syntonic B-natural the harmony becomes 
purer, yielding an absolutely exact 5:4 compound third. While the upper 
B-natural is now held, the lower voice then sounds a Pythagorean C-flat, and 
this can be heard slightly out of phase with the upper part. The two sounds lie 
exactly one octave plus one schisma apart. While to many ears this will still 
form an acceptable octave, nobody will fail to hear that the sound produced by 
the slight mismatch changes color and that a steady beat (of a tempo 
approximating to eighth-note=72) is produced. </p>
<p>
[13] Willaert has therefore 
devised a means of notating comma inflection. While it is true that the exact 
notation of Syntonic comma inflection cannot be attained graphically, Willaert 
has realized that the notation of Pythagorean comma inflection certainly can. 
The difference is almost negligible, and the likelihood is that any singer with 
even modest perception would in any case arrive at the consonance and 
instinctively render it absolutely in tune. What Willaert has done is to use a 
traditional singer&rsquo;s Pythagoreanism against him by constructing a melodic matrix 
in such a way that its purely Pythagorean execution will actually cause the 
resulting harmony to be Ptolemaic. The singer&mdash;probably for the first time in 
his life&mdash;will unexpectedly discover that his precise Pythagorean intervals 
will have led him to produce consonances of a purity that he has never before 
attained. But he will have been foolish to have assumed that this was the result 
only of his own unexpected excellence as a singer; the reality is that the 
outcome is entirely attributable to the skill and planning of the composer. </p>

[14] 
An understanding of the tetrachord structure of Willaert&rsquo;s Tenor as revealed 
through Example 1 provides the real key to understanding his notation. It will 
be observed that each new conjoined tetrachord, in adding its flat, acquires its 
status only through the presumption that the previous tetrachord (to which it 
has been, and remains, conjoined) is still in operation. When the sixth 
conjoined tetrachord arrives (with its C-flat), the assumption has to be that 
all earlier ones still apply and that the tetrachord structure is an overall 
transparent and solid one. In expressing this tetrachord matrix in modern 
notation, we now have to recognize the differences of convention that apply. 
Modern notation requires the global addition of a flat to be indicated not only 
by signaling the arrival of the new flat itself, but also by reasserting the 
continued presence of the old one. When, for example, we modulate from the key 
of F major to B-flat major, the new key has to be signaled not merely by the 
insertion of a flat on E, but also by the (tautologous by sixteenth-century 
standards) reassertion of the flat already existing on B. Hence we move from a 
&ldquo;1-flat&rdquo; situation to a &ldquo;2-flat&rdquo; one. But the repetition of the first on B is 
one of convention only, and is not in any way needed musically since no 
cancellation of this has been indicated. We could therefore rewrite Example 1 as 
indicated in <b>Example 3</b>. Here it can be seen that the new signatures not only present 
new flats, but also restate flats that are already assumed from the previous 
signature. This restatement is one of modern convention only, and by 
16th-century standards is quite unnecessary. When, however, we translate 
Willaert&rsquo;s Tenor notation into its modern equivalent, we also have to take into 
account modern conventions. Hence the arrival of each new conjunct tetrachord 
needs to be indicated by a change of signature in which not only is the new flat 
indicated, but also the flats that already exist. This can be seen in 
<b>Example 
4a</b>. The 
presentation of Example 4a shows clearly how Willaert&rsquo;s notation (first staff) 
corresponds with its modern equivalent (second staff). What to us moderns is 
indicated by staff 2 was, to Willaert&rsquo;s contemporaries, conveyed by staff 1. 
They mean exactly the same. </p>


<p>
[15] This analysis reveals an important observation 
that challenges previous analyses of this Tenor. First and foremost is the clear 
indication that the final note&mdash;<i>as actually presented notationally</i>&mdash;is 
E-flat and not E-natural. So when various writers have described the notation as 
requiring the performance of notes &ldquo;one degree lower in pitch&rdquo; (indicating an 
uncertainty over whether it is a tone or a semitone), we can now clearly observe 
that the difference in pitch required is always a semitone (and never a tone). 
This can be achieved simply by the addition of the second layer of <i>ficta</i> that 
Willaert assumed would be added in performance (this being the reason why he 
left his notation to stand a semitone higher than the performance pitches 
required). The manner of actual performance required is indicated in 
<b>Example 4b</b>. It must be remembered that the indicated editorial flats are now <i>in 
addition</i> to the still-present notated flats as indicated by the six-flat 
signature that has been attained. The beauty of Willaert&rsquo;s structure, however, is 
that the singer does not need to worry at all about how this second <i>ficta</i> 
layer has to be conceptualized. He can venture with complete confidence &ldquo;unarmed 
into battle&rdquo; because he only needs to descend a perfect fifth from the C-flat 
(thereby applying the first flattening to the written F) and thereafter read 
Willaert&rsquo;s notation <i>exactly as presented</i>, with all its still-current <i>coniunctae</i>. 
He will, in fact, merely be transposing (without any effort whatsoever) all the 
remaining notes a semitone lower in pitch, with no worry about having to make 
individual decisions as to whether a particular note is, or is not, inflected 
any differently from any other. But Willaert&rsquo;s particular genius lies in his 
presumption that when the singer flattens these notes, he will be doing so by 
the value of a Pythagorean major semitone, thereby providing automatically the 
desired comma inflection. </p>
<p>
[16] But why did Willaert not fully notate the second 
layer of <i>ficta</i> in addition to the first, thereby leaving the second half of 
the Tenor to be notationally presented a semitone higher than the required sung 
pitches? There is a clear technical reason why Willaert a) only notated flats as 
far down the chain as C-flat, and b) left the remaining notated pitches to stand 
a semitone higher than the sounds he required from the singer. Notated <i>musica 
ficta</i>, whether indicated by a sharp or flat, can only exist between two <i>musica 
recta</i> notes that lie a tone apart. The most distant pitch flatwards that would 
agree with this principle is the note C-flat (which is placed between the two 
<i>recta</i> notes B-flat and C).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Were Willaert to have continued his <i>ficta</i> 
requirements through the notation, he would have needed to proceed with F-flat 
(which is not bounded by <i>recta</i> notes lying a tone apart, since E-flat is 
fictive), and progress then through double flats (none of which could possibly 
be bounded by <i>recta</i> notes separated by a tone). This technical limitation does 
not, however, extend to &ldquo;performed&rdquo; (but unwritten) <i>ficta</i>. The clear signal 
for invoking the application of &ldquo;performed&rdquo; (only) <i>ficta</i> following the Tenor 
C-flat is the visual descent of the diminished 5th (C-flat/F) which would need 
to be changed (in performance only) into a perfect 5th by the singing of an F 
also flattened by a Pythagorean major semitone (thereby attaining Willaert&rsquo;s 
goal of the pitch E lowered by a comma). Such a use of the performed pitch 
&ldquo;F-flat&rdquo; then produces a simultaneity with the Cantus G in which the aural 
effect is a (compound) minor third widened by a Pythagorean comma (yielding a 
tolerably pure 6:5 minor third). It is at this moment (already signaled by the 
preceding notated C-flat) that Willaert has accomplished his objective in 
asserting the transformation to Syntonic tuning (which then remains valid for 
the duration of the piece). </p>
<h3>
SYNTONIC TUNING: &ldquo;Addocet 
artes&rdquo; (teaches new skills) </h3>
<p>
[17] The second half of Willaert&rsquo;s motet 
(specifically from the arrival of the Tenor C-flat) invokes a fundamentally 
different sound world from the first half. That the first section is entirely 
Pythagorean is proved by the evidence given above which shows the structural 
purpose as having been to arrive exactly at the Pythagorean pitch &ldquo;C-flat&rdquo;. In 
the soundscape of the first section, therefore, all the tones are of the same 
size (9:8), and all the semitones are minor (256:243). Ditones (major thirds) 
will inevitably be dissonant (81:64) as will semiditones (minor thirds, with the 
ratio 32:27). The inversions of these intervals will also be dissonant by the 
same degrees. Only by preserving these traditional Pythagorean intervals will 
the singer of the Tenor correctly arrive at his exactly-pitched C-flat, and only 
via the same means will the singer of the Cantus attain his exactly-pitched G. 
When both have been accomplished (by Pythagorean means only) Willaert will have 
succeeded in making the two singers arrive (whether they expected it or not) at 
the interval of a &ldquo;pure minor sixth&rdquo; (C-flat/G, being heard as &ldquo;B (lowered by a 
comma)/G&rdquo;). </p>
<p>
[18] But the resulting interval of a &ldquo;pure minor sixth&rdquo; (8:5) is now 
<i>not</i> Pythagorean (because, as shown in paragraph [17] above, the Pythagorean 
minor sixth has the dissonant ratio of 128:81 since it is an inversion of the 
major third whose ratio is 81:64). What Willaert has now invoked, therefore, is 
the very different soundscape of Syntonic tuning (usually described by the term 
&ldquo;Just Intonation&rdquo;). The successful performance of Just Intonation (JI) requires 
new skills, and it is easy to see how Willaert has provided in this composition 
the means of acquiring and using these. The exact nature of the different skills 
required must first briefly be explained, because they are not in any way more 
&ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; than the skills required for Pythagorean tuning. They 
are not merely different, but are actually more complex. Only when the rules and 
procedures of JI are understood, and can be applied by performers, will the 
resulting soundscape match that assumed by a particular composer at the point 
when he carefully structured his composition according to this particular sound 
world (as opposed to the majority of other contemporary composers who did not, 
and remained faithful to the Pythagorean sound world). </p>
<p>
[19] The Syntonic 
diatonic tetrachord of Ptolemy (which is the structural basis for JI) differs 
from the Pythagorean diatonic tetrachord in one crucial way: unlike the 
Pythagorean tetrachord (in which the only consonant interval is the fourth), the 
Ptolemaic tetrachord uses pitch classes in which all pitches have a pure 
harmonic relationship with one or other of the outer notes. This is ensured 
because each interval is structured so as to provide a simple superparticular 
ratio. The tetrachord B-C-D-E is accorded the following intervals in the ratios 
indicated: semitone (16:15)&mdash;tone (9:8)&mdash;tone (10:9). This yields the 
following pure consonances: the major third (C-E) is 5:4, the minor third (B-D) 
is 6:5 and the fourth (B-E) is 4:3. </p>
<p>
[20] The one crucial interval magnitude that 
changes the Pythagorean tetrachord into the Ptolemaic Syntonic tetrachord 
(thereby invoking the sound world of JI) is the magnitude of the Syntonic comma 
whose ratio is 81:80. It can be applied in two ways: a) the two inner notes (in 
this case C and D) can both be raised by a Syntonic comma; or b) the two outer 
notes (here B and E) can be lowered by a Syntonic comma. It is important to bear 
in mind that whichever alternative is adopted in no way changes the base pitch 
of the piece within which it is used; the Syntonic inflection merely brings the 
thirds and sixths into consonance so as to match the consonances already 
employed by the use of fourths, fifths and octaves. At least two of the pitches 
will maintain the base pitch standard of the composition within which they are 
being used. The only intervals that will remain unchanged (in this case) are B-E 
(4:3) and C-D (9:8). The other two intervals will each have been changed by the 
value of a Syntonic comma (81:80). So the semitone B-C will have been increased 
in size by 81:80 (i.e. the value by which either the C has been raised, or the B 
lowered, depending upon whether a) or b) above has been applied) yielding the 
ratio 16:15. The minor third B-D will have been widened also by the Syntonic 
comma and result in the pure interval of 6:5, and the major third C-E will have 
been narrowed by a Syntonic comma giving the interval ratio 5:4. Additionally, 
the tone D-E will now be smaller than the tone C-D (thereby introducing into the 
diatonic system a major and a minor tone) since it, too, will have been narrowed 
by the same Syntonic comma. </p>

<p>
[21] The difference in soundscape that JI invokes is 
striking: the sour effect of the Pythagorean minor third&mdash;perceptibly (by syntonic standards) too small&mdash;is removed, and the harshness of the Pythagorean 
major third&mdash;perceptibly (by the same standards) too wide&mdash;is tempered. 
<b>Example 5</b>, and its associated audio example, illustrates the differences 
graphically and audibly. The first extract (a) provides a Pythagorean tetrachord 
used both melodically and harmonically; the second (b) repeats the first, but 
this time tuned syntonically. The melodic presentation of the 
tetrachord tuned syntonically presents the following clear differences from that 
of the Pythagorean-tuned one: the semitone is audibly larger, and the two tones 
are of different size (C-D is major, and D-E minor). When these pitch classes 
are then (in the audio for Example 5) performed harmonically the effect of Syntonic 
tuning becomes even more pronounced: both thirds are perfectly in tune (the 
minor having been widened, the major narrowed). </p>
<p>
[22] The issues surrounding the 
performance of JI are therefore significantly more complex than those that apply 
to Pythagorean performance. The following new skills are required of the singer: 
a) the ability accurately to perform a diatonic semitone adjudged as larger than 
a Pythagorean minor semitone, but smaller than a Pythagorean major semitone 
(indeed one that has the exact ratio of 16:15, and is perceptibly larger than 
half a 9:8 tone); b) an ability to perform accurately two different sizes of 
tone (the larger being equivalent to the Pythagorean 9:8 tone, and the smaller 
having the exact ratio of 10:9). It is at this point that the traditional 
foundations of hexachord theory and practice must surely cease to provide a 
valid basis for musical cognition, evaluation and performance. </p>
<p>
[23] The 
inapplicability of traditional solmization to the musical world of JI is easy to 
explain (and this bears upon a correct understanding of this Willaert motet). If 
a tetrachord is solmized, the syllables that must be applied are mi-fa-sol-la. 
But the Syntonic tetrachord asserts that the interval sizes of fa-sol and sol-la 
will be different (one will be 9:8 and the other 10:9). The hexachord system 
achieves its practicability from the premise that all tones are the <i>same</i> size, 
and that fa-sol in the hard hexachord (C-D) will yield the same pitch classes as 
sol-la in the soft hexachord (again C-D, with the same 9:8 interval ratio). In 
order for singers to be able to determine which tones are major and which minor, 
they would need to achieve a structural melodic cognition <i>prior to</i> making 
decisions as to how their solmization will be applied. They would discover that 
sometimes what they might choose to sing as &ldquo;fa-sol&rdquo; and at other times &ldquo;sol-la&rdquo; 
will be variously major or minor (with no connection as to which in terms of the 
syllables they choose to apply), and they will need to have decided which is 
which, and where, <i>before</i> they apply the syllables. Furthermore they will need 
to have assumed in advance that the step mi-fa now provides the non-Pythagorean 
larger semitone whose ratio is 16:15. The position would then be that singers 
would no longer be able to use the hexachord system and the Hand as a tool for 
<i>arriving at</i> an understanding of melodic structure and a delivery of its 
preordained pitch relationships. In a Pythagorean context where all tones are of 
one common size, as are all diatonic semitones, the Hand provides a simple 
method of cognition and delivery; but in a Syntonic framework in which the 
interval structure is more sophisticated the foundations of hexachord theory 
fail to provide the correct technical framework. Since, moreover, the relative 
pitches of the notes sung to either fa-sol or sol-la will be variable according 
to context (musical, not hexachordal), it is clear that solmization can no 
longer be used as the primary tool for accurate intonation of pitch. The 
question then must arise as to whether, since the correct musical cognition must 
now be independent from the hexachord system, solmization was of any further 
practical use (at least within the Syntonic context of JI). </p>
<p>
[24] At the point 
where Willaert sets Horace&rsquo;s words &ldquo;addocet artes&rdquo;, we can see what these &ldquo;new 
skills&rdquo; are and the way in which the composer goes about &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; them. He 
does not rely upon an assumed ability the singer might supposedly have, but 
steers him carefully and inevitably to pitch each note accurately within its 
ordained harmonic context. The result is that the &ldquo;new&rdquo; intervals (i.e. the 
diatonic major semitone and the minor tone) are learnt through the 
inescapability of needing (under the composer&rsquo;s close and tight control) to 
provide successive pitches that match the clearly articulated harmonic movement 
and context.</p>
<h3>
POLYDIATONICISM and the Squaring of the Circle </h3>
<p>
[25] Before 
observing Willaert&rsquo;s strategy for teaching the new intervals, it is necessary to 
consider what the new pitches are and how they have been constructed. As has 
been shown above, Willaert has maintained a single default scale for the 
Cantus,<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> but has carefully steered the Tenor consistently flatwards towards 
the goal of C-flat (so that it can then function as a B lowered by a comma). In 
order to explain the harmonic matrix that he has constructed, I here introduce 
the new technical term &ldquo;Polydiatonicism&rdquo;. As the first half of the piece 
progresses, and new <i>coniunctae</i> are successively introduced, the Tenor&mdash;while 
remaining completely diatonic&mdash;increasingly uses diatonic pitch material that 
differs from the diatonic pitches still being used in the Cantus. By the time 
C-flat arises, the two concurrent scales being used are totally different. The 
Cantus is still using the default pitches including the B-flat (as set by the 
signature), and remains essentially a &ldquo;white-note&rdquo; diatonic scale. The Tenor, 
however, has by this time adopted an essentially &ldquo;black-note&rdquo; diatonic scale 
with only a single &ldquo;white note&rdquo; (F). All other pitches have now been flattened. 
While both lines maintain a clear diatonic structure (since no semitone occurs 
that is not scalically surrounded by at least two whole tones), the two diatonic 
matrices are completely different. While the texture is polyphonic, the harmonic 
combination is additionally polydiatonic.</p>
<p>
[26] This polydiatonicism changes, however, as soon as the C-flat arises. Up until then, 
Willaert has contrived the polydiatonicism to function harmonically by a careful 
combination of differing melodic materials so as to form consonances. These 
consonances frequently present interesting and unusual cross relations 
(particularly through the interplay of D-flat and D-natural, giving a feeling of 
&ldquo;major/minor&rdquo; alternation). From the arrival of the C-flat, however, the 
polydiatonicism becomes entirely graphic (the Tenor now notationally continuing 
as if a semitone too high for the remainder of the piece, and visibly still 
asserting its &ldquo;black-note&rdquo; pitches). But the addition of the second 
(performed-only) <i>ficta</i> layer now inflects the actual sung pitch material back 
into exact alignment with the scale that has remained constant in the Cantus. 
But there has now been a very subtle change in the pitch classes used. What was 
previously Pythagorean A has now become Pythagorean B-double flat (which lies a 
comma lower than A). Similarly, what has become Pythagorean A-double flat is now 
a comma lower than the previous Pythagorean G. The same difference affects E 
because this now aligns with what the Tenor singer has asserted as &ldquo;Pythagorean 
F-flat&rdquo; (lower by a comma than E). Both voices are therefore now using exactly 
the same audible pitch materials, even though one of them (the Tenor) is 
arriving at them by the application of double <i>ficta</i> (the first layer notated 
by the accumulation of six written flats, and the second by the singer&rsquo;s further 
addition of an unwritten <i>ficta</i> flat to every remaining written note). </p>

<p>
[27] The 
resulting tetrachords are now structured with different intervals from the 
previous Pythagorean ones, as illustrated in <b>Example 6</b>. It can be seen that the synemmenon tetrachord (A-B 
flat-C-D) now has its outer notes (A and D) flattened by a comma. In performance 
the difference will inevitably be a Syntonic comma (only a schisma different 
from the Pythagorean comma that Willaert has actually specified notationally) 
because this magnitude will bring the consonances into exact purity. The rising 
intervals will therefore be as follows: major semitone (16:15)&mdash;major tone 
(9:8)&mdash;minor tone (10:9). Since the tetrachord structure is now fully octachordal, there is a disjunction between D and E that will also be a major 
tone (9:8). The next tetrachord (E-A) also has its outer notes lowered by a 
comma, but it can be seen that here the G is also lowered. The interval 
combination is slightly different as follows: major semitone (16:15)&mdash;minor 
tone (10:9)&mdash;major tone (9:8). The reason why the intervals are in a slightly 
different order is simply because Willaert needs frequently to use the 
combination G/D and requires that this should form an exact 3:2 perfect fifth. 
He has therefore placed the minor tone below the major in this tetrachord. The 
interval/pitch pattern presented by these two disjunct tetrachords is merely 
repeated for each octave above and below, according to the compass of the 
voices.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[28] In teaching the singer the new intervals, 
Willaert needs to demonstrate not only their magnitudes but also where such 
intervals are positioned in the scale. The first new interval&mdash;the major 
semitone (16:15)&mdash;is more straightforward in that its positioning in the scale 
is obviously fixed at the base of each tetrachord. It will occur with the 
pitches E-F and A-B flat.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> All that is needed is practice in singing the 
intervals at the correct (non-Pythagorean) size. Willaert wastes no time, and 
the first thing he asks of the Tenor, having descended from the C-flat, is to 
sing this interval both rising and falling (via the written notes F/G flat/F to 
be performed a semitone lower via added <i>ficta</i>). The correct intonation is not 
difficult since the singer has now already experienced the effect of pure and 
in-tune tertial harmonies from his two previous notes. By keeping the thirds 
pure, he will effortlessly intone a correct 16:15 semitone, and will realize 
from the experience that this same magnitude must now be applied to all 
remaining diatonic semitones. Willaert&rsquo;s immediate exercise is shown in 
<b>Example 
7</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
[29] The correct cognition and 
execution of the minor tone (10:9) is more challenging since not only is this a 
new interval but also its correct and fixed location within the scale needs to 
be understood (since it will inevitably occur next to another tone within the 
diatonic scale that will be major). Within the Tenor range, there is only one 
position where the minor tone is applied. Example 6 shows this to be the step 
F/G (still read as G-flat/A-flat), since the remaining notes are all contained 
within the sounded range D/B-flat (read as E-flat/C-flat). How does Willaert 
indicate this position? </p>
<p>
[30] In the original notation of the Tenor voice, the 
insertion of flats in the first half is of structural importance (as shown 
above) in unfolding the heptachordal structure of the tetrachords that allows 
the attainment of Pythagorean C-flat. But there are two remaining notated flats 
in the second half.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Of these, the first is placed before low E indicating a 
normal flattening. Its insertion is not merely &ldquo;cautionary&rdquo; however, because low 
E has not before had a flat placed in front of it (this having been restricted 
to the upper octave only). So it is a fully functional flat (even though its 
performance is concurrently subjected to double <i>ficta</i> by the singer). Three 
notes later, however, a further apparently &ldquo;cautionary&rdquo; flat is placed in front 
of A (which has previously been flattened). Although this may not seem necessary 
in quite the same way, it does nonetheless have a functional purpose. The use of 
a flat (as in every other previous case) is to indicate a narrowing of interval 
between the note bearing the symbol and the pitch that lies immediately below it 
in the scale (a tone being made into a semitone). In the case of this apparently 
&ldquo;cautionary&rdquo; flat, the narrowing has a more subtle meaning: that of indicating 
the presence of a minor tone (10:9) instead of the normal Pythagorean (major) 
tone (9:8). The singer will therefore observe that the tone (which he must sing 
in order to provide structural diatonic harmony with the Cantus) will be 
slightly narrowed to form a minor tone, and that the position of the minor tone 
will henceforth be located between what he reads as G-flat and A-flat (actually 
of course sung as F/G since he will be applying his double <i>ficta</i>). The 
narrowing is indicated by the visual reassertion of the flat in front of A, but 
the omission of that (which is still nonetheless operative) in front of G. </p>
<h3>
FOUR-VOICE VERSION </h3>
<p>
[31] 
As a conclusion to this essay, a brief reconsideration of Willaert&rsquo;s piece in 
its four-voice version will be offered. Although only the Altus appears in a 
contemporary print,<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> there must also have been a Bassus. As mentioned above, 
Aron considered the two-voice version given to him by Spataro to be probably 
only part of a four-voice texture. The question of authorship of the Altus and 
(still lost) Bassus needs some comment, because it is not unusual during this 
era for extra voices to be added by other composers to pre-existent 
compositions. Lowinsky observed that the printed source for the Altus (only) was 
likely to date from c. 1530, and we must assume that its survival indicates that 
a Bassus must have been in circulation also at this time. What will be clear 
from the reconstruction to be offered is that whoever provided these two other 
voices must have fully understood Willaert&rsquo;s intentions by providing two further 
voices that exactly correspond with these intentions. Yet we know that some of 
the best theoretical minds of the time (Spataro, Aron, Cavazzoni and later 
Artusi) showed no clear evidence of having been able to see Willaert&rsquo;s point. 
Indeed Artusi and Spataro clearly did not, while Aron remains at best reticent. 
So who as early as c. 1530 could have understood the point of the composition, 
and its structural articulation? It was certainly none of those who rehearsed 
and exchanged their views on the piece from as early as 1524, and as late as 
1600. The prime (and not unexpected) candidate is surely Willaert himself. There 
are, moreover, structural aspects that indicate that the four-voice texture was 
the original concept, even though the piece can certainly stand as an exercise 
in two-voice counterpoint (which it clearly did for Spataro).</p>

<p>
[32] The Syntonic structure of the second half is 
actually clarified by the surviving Altus, and (as Lowinsky discovered) the 
restoration of a Bassus is not too difficult. At the point where the Tenor 
C-flat (functioning harmonically as a B-natural) falls by its perfect fifth to 
F-flat (functioning harmonically as E), the Altus skillfully enters on C to 
fulfill the voice-leading requirements asserted by the Tenor C-flat (=B) with its 
&ldquo;leading-note&rdquo; effect. Until then the Altus kept discreetly out of the way 
during a brief period of silence. This is shown in 
<b>Example 8</b>. As the phrase shown in Example 8 proceeds, the 
last dying embers of Pythagorean tuning can be identified in measure 23 on beat 
3. Here a chord of C (in which all notes are lowered by a comma) actually 
produces Pythagorean intervals for the last time in the piece. Willaert rarely 
makes use of the harmonic combination of C/G (here the C is temporarily lowered, 
but later&mdash;in measure 29&mdash;it is the G that is raised) because in the scale he 
has established the two do not make a pure fifth (the G being lowered, but the C 
left by default at base pitch). Most other harmonic uses of G are in association 
with D (whose default is similarly lowered by a comma). This final use of 
Pythagorean tuning is shown in 
<b>Example 9</b>. From that moment onwards, all tunings are pure 
and Willaert shows a complete control of comma inflection in his structuring of 
the harmony and counterpoint. The &ldquo;new skills&rdquo; have now been demonstrated and 
rehearsed, and the singers need only continue to apply them in the ways they 
have just learnt. They will find that all semitones are large (16:15), minor 
tones (10:9) occur between C/D and F/G, and all other tones are major (9:8). 
When Willaert&rsquo;s music is thenceforth sung with these interval values and 
positions, the harmony will consist of pure thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths and 
octaves. </p>
<p>
[33] Lowinsky&rsquo;s edition of the piece in its four-voice version is not 
only the earliest, but is also the only available edition that correctly 
realizes the interval structure of the Tenor voice.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Unshackled by the 
solmization-based approach of later commentators, his melodic deduction (though 
totally inferred from its perceived context within the four-voice texture) 
actually accords exactly with the interval structure proposed in this article 
(but here based upon a quite different view of the structural purpose and 
execution). </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 10</b>.

<p>
[34] In conclusion, I here offer a 
new edition and performance of Willaert&rsquo;s motet that preserves exactly the 
tuning I have argued as having been Willaert&rsquo;s goal of attainment.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> While the 
Cantus and Altus voices are exactly as presented by Lowinsky, the Tenor has been 
renotated. The Bassus is new, although many similarities will be noted with 
Lowinsky&rsquo;s version as well as some important differences, especially in the 
range.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> While Lowinsky regarded the Bassus as essentially a smooth counter 
melody to the Tenor, I have treated it (as Willaert treated the Altus) more like 
a <i>Contra</i>, and consequently its function is to provide a &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; role at 
certain points. What should be perfectly clear from the
audio for 
<b>Example 10</b> is the 
remarkable change of tuning that suddenly takes place from the moment the Tenor 
reaches its C-flat. This quite audible change of soundscape should, more than 
any historical or theoretical argument, convince the listener that Willaert&rsquo;s 
whole purpose was to assert his view of the superiority of the Syntonic sound 
world over that of the Pythagorean by placing the two in direct opposition to 
each other. His clever attainment of the Syntonic sound world by the exact 
notation of pitches to be conceived in terms of the Pythagorean shows the utmost 
precision in squaring the tuning circle. His care in teaching the singer how to 
use the new intervals &ldquo;reveals secrets&rdquo; through the &ldquo;teaching of new skills&rdquo;. 
Willaert has also &ldquo;removed the burden from worried minds&rdquo; by presenting a melody 
that is completely interval specific, and requires nothing other than a single, 
simple move into the &ldquo;double <i>ficta</i>&rdquo; region by taking a perfect instead of a 
(notated) diminished fifth. He has otherwise done all the work for the singer. 
Any singer who comes through this experience will be one fully able to apply the 
acquired skills to other music using the Syntonic scale. His former confidence 
as one merely going &ldquo;unarmed into battle&rdquo; will now have been strengthened by a 
technical understanding and attainment that will have changed his whole musical 
outlook.</p>

tetrachords its resulting diatonicism regulates the disposition of tones and 
semitones so that each semitone is surrounded (if the pitch material is 
presented as a scale) by a minimum of two and a maximum of three undivided 
tones. If the tetrachords are disjunct, there will be three undivided tones in 
the series. Where tetrachords are conjunct there will be only two.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Similarly (though irrelevant to this composition) the 
most distant pitch in the chain sharpwards 
to which <i>ficta</i> notation could be applied is A-sharp (occurring between the two 
<i>recta</i> notes A and B).</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">All voices are given a default signature of one flat 
and this indicates that the default pitch material will be a scale that employs 
the synemmenon tetrachord with the B-flat and not the Diezeugmenon with 
B-natural. This will assert a disjunction of tetrachords on the notes D-E (D 
being the highest note of the synemmenon and E the lowest note of the Meson). 
Only the Tenor voice applies structured modifications to this default as it adds 
its further flats. The other voices remain faithful to the default, thereby 
retaining the simple &ldquo;white-note&rdquo; scale with an added B-flat.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">A full account of Syntonic tuning is given by 
Willaert&rsquo;s distinguished pupil, the theorist Zarlino in his <i>Le 
Istitutioni Harmoniche</i>, part 3. Full texts and graphics of this work are 
available online at <a href='http://www.music.indiana.edu/smi/cinquecento'>http://www.music.indiana.edu/smi/cinquecento</a>. 
This will not be discussed in this essay, but will form part of the supporting 
evidence presented in a later essay that develops further the findings revealed 
here.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">The singer of the Tenor will still be reading these 
semitones as F-G flat and B flat-C flat (sung a semitone lower by double 
<i>ficta</i>).</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">These flats are also shown in 
<a target='ex_window' href='wibberley1_ex7_gif.html'>Example 7</a> above near the 
end of staff 1.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Altus partbook of <i>Libro primo de la fortuna</i> 
discussed in Edward Lowinsky, &ldquo;Adrian Willaert&rsquo;s Chromatic &lsquo;duo&rsquo; Re-examined&rdquo;.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">His Tenor was correct, but for the wrong reasons. His 
four-voice rendition made the Tenor&rsquo;s interval structure more or less 
inevitable, but the insertion of multiple editorial flats and double-flats 
obscures the simplicity and clarity of the original notation, and misunderstands 
the structural purpose of the resulting melodic inflections in terms of the 
transformation to Syntonic tuning. Indeed, Lowinsky assumed the use of equal 
temperament. The editorial flats also presume that the notational default (in 
the second half) is &ldquo;white-note&rdquo; whereas we can now see that an understanding of 
the tetrachord structure reveals it to be essentially &ldquo;black-note&rdquo;.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">The pitches are computer generated, and a detailed 
explanation of the processes used to produce this, and all other audio examples 
accompanying this study, will be offered in a future article.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Lowinsky&rsquo;s Bassus adopted a range of an octave plus a 
sixth, and this was much greater than that found in the other voices.</div>
