<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The concept of interval class (ic)&mdash;the grouping together of pairs of
inversionally-related intervals, e.g., minor 2nd and major 7th, into single
categories&mdash;is fundamental to theories of non-tonal music. Much journal 
space has been taken up with articles in which interval-classes are a basic 
structural construct, and many of the proposed functions for measuring the 
similarity of non-tonal sonorities rely on the concept by basing their 
calculations of similarity on the interval-class vectors (icvs) of the set-classes.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Such discussions have tended to treat interval-class purely as a 
structural idea, however, and not been concerned with whether the concept 
has any reality as a psychological construct. Neither does such discussion 
address the related question of what interrelationships the various  
interval-classes might have with each other, assuming that the concept has 
psychological validity in the first place.


<p>[2] While most writers seem to believe that ics are the appropriate level of 
abstraction for discussing the function of intervals in atonal musical 
structures, a few have begun to consider alternatives. Marcus Castr&eacute;n, for 
example, has suggested a partial separation of ic components, which he terms 
<i>registrally-ordered intervals</i> (ro-intervals); under this scheme, the two 
components of each interval-class are still paired but maintain separate 
identities by acknowledging differences in function in musical contexts, 
smaller intervals having more to do with melodic situations and larger 
intervals operating in a harmonic realm. Olli V&auml;is&auml;l&auml; has used the concept  
for 
an interesting analysis of Schoenberg&rsquo;s op. 19, no. 2, allowing him to argue  
for 
a late-tonal interpretation of the piece.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> At least one author has brought  
up 
the question of the relationships between interval-classes: Eric Isaacson 
sounded a cautionary note in this journal in 1996, wondering, &ldquo;[D]o we hear 
ic1 and ic2 as being equal in dissimilarity to, say, ic1 and ic5? Might  
their 
similarity be affected by factors such as relative consonance and 
dissonance?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> In her dissertation of two years earlier, Diana Stammers had 
already found some empirical evidence that different ics were treated 
differently by listeners.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Thus, 
there seems to be a strong need for more extensive empirical work to determine 
whether interval-class as defined by music theory has psychological validity. 
</p>


<p>[3] The number of empirical studies about non-tonal sonorities and the  
factors 
influencing the perceived similarities among them is still very small,  
despite 
the overwhelming importance of this issue in the music-theoretic 
community.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> This is a problem for 
those who believe that theories of the structure of music should have some 
connection to how music is actually perceived. These empirical studies by and 
large have been concerned with issues of similarity between non-tonal chords as 
holistic objects. This is a higher level of structure than interval-class 
itself, although a level that is certainly influenced by how interval-class 
might or might not operate in a psychological sense. To make any direct 
investigations about interval-class as a psychological construct requires 
empirical study at a more basic level, that of the similarity of intervals by 
themselves. Again, nearly no empirical studies have been taken on this subject, 
even though the issue of interval similarity has obvious pedagogical 
implications for aural skills curricula. (Similarity is strongly related to 
confusability, since similar items are more likely to be confused than 
dissimilar ones. Thus, better knowledge of interval similarity could help 
teachers optimize classroom drill time for interval identification skills.)</p>


<p>[4] Similarity data can be obtained in several direct or indirect ways.  
First, one 
can simply ask subjects to rate the similarity of two intervals on, say, a  
5-point 
or 7-point scale. Second, one can present triples of intervals and ask  
subjects 
whether interval A sounds more like interval B or interval C&mdash;this is called 
&ldquo;triadic comparison,&rdquo; and has nothing to do with triads in functional  
tonality. 
Third, one can use confusion data, where the similarity of intervals A and B 
is a function of how often A is mistakenly identified as B.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
In all cases, however, a large matrix of data will be generated, and humans are 
ill-equipped for analyzing masses of numbers. Some form of numerical 
visualization technique is needed to help the researcher see patterns in the 
data, and such computational techniques have been developed over the last forty 
years. </p>


<p>[5] Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is the most important of these 
visualization techniques; it is a numerical method that solves the problem, 
given the inter-city distance matrix from a road atlas, derive the relative 
geometric locations of the cities.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Similarity data is run through an MDS 
program, and the different dimensions of the resulting geometric 
configuration are then interpreted as factors determining the similarity of  
the 
objects involved. If interval-class has some existence as a psychological 
construct, then in any MDS solution of interval similarity data the minor  
2nd 
and major 7th should situate near each other, in at least some of the 
dimensions, and likewise for other pairs of ic-components. We can also use 
MDS to directly compare empirical data to predictions of alternative 
theoretical models (for example, an interaction of interval-class and  
interval-size, something akin to Castr&eacute;n&rsquo;s ro-intervals) by generating similarity 
matrices for those models and comparing the resulting geometries to that 
produced by the actual data. </p>


<p>[6] Only a handful of articles on interval similarity have appeared. Some of 
the earlier works, by Ortmann and by Jeffries, present results in ways that 
preclude obtaining similarity matrices that could be used as input to an MDS 
program; a much earlier study by von Maltzew did provide quantitative data 
on interval identification but was concerned only with interval recognition  
at 
the uppermost extremes of human hearing (in the highest octave on the 
piano or above) and is thus not very relevant to typical musical  
experience.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
Two independent studies on interval similarity appeared in the 1970s, one by 
Reiner Plomp and colleagues and the other by Rosemary Killam and colleagues. 
Both generated usable matrices of confusion data, although neither group applied 
MDS analysis and only the paper by Killam et al. was concerned with the 
music-theoretic&mdash;and specifically pedagogical&mdash;implications of interval 
confusability. I shall return to discuss these later in this essay.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>


<p>[7] In the spring of 2002, I obtained confusion data on intervals from a  
sample of 
27 undergraduate music majors at the Ithaca College School of Music, in a 
study to help improve aural skills pedagogy. The subjects all had had  
classroom training on 
the simple intervals (less than an octave); 18 had completed or exempted 
through third-term (chromatic tonal) or fourth-term (twentieth-century) 
aural skills. The subjects listened to sound files of the various simple 
intervals played on a computer using a pseudo-clarinet timbre, presented in 
three different presentation modes (harmonic, ascending melodic, and 
descending melodic), and at ten different transposition levels (top note of  
the 
interval in the range <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 to F5), for a total of 330 experimental trials per 
subject (11 intervals x 3 modes x 10 levels). Each harmonic interval sounded 
for .75 sec., while the components of the melodic intervals sounded for .5  
sec. 
each with a .25 sec. gap between them. To forestall any systematic effects  
across 
trials, each subject was given the trials in a different random order, with 
several constraints between consecutive trials imposed on such orders: 1) no 
same interval; 2) no same presentation mode; and 3) no common tone 
between any interval members. After hearing a trial, the subjects clicked on 
one of 11 on-screen buttons to identify the interval type heard. They were  
told 
that while they should strive for correct identifications, they needed to  
make 
&ldquo;snap judgments&rdquo; and not try to analyze what they had just heard. They had 
8.5 sec. within which to make a response, else a missing value was marked 
and the next trial commenced. Trials were presented in blocks of 20; while a 
subject could not stop during a block, they could take as long a break  
between 
blocks as they wished (and indeed were strongly encouraged to do so as often 
as needed, given the repetitiveness of the task!). Also, each experimental 
session was limited to 30 minutes, to further reduce any potential for 
cognitive fatigue.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>

<p>[8] The resulting confusion data were aggregated in a couple of ways (by 
transposition level, by presentation mode, and by both) and analyzed using 
several different techniques, including MDS. A number of interesting results 
with implications for aural skills pedagogy were obtained; these have been 
reported elsewhere<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> and are not 
germane to this discussion, so I shall not repeat them here. For present 
purposes, the implications of the MDS analysis for atonal theory are of 
interest. </p>


<p>[9] Based on goodness-of-fit analysis, three-dimensional solutions were 
obtained for the data aggregated across all presentation modes and 
transposition levels, as well as for the matrices for each individual 
presentation mode, again aggregated across all transposition levels. Other 
analysis indicated that transposition level of itself was not a factor in  
shaping 
error rates, so no discussion is given for the data as separated by  
pitch-level. 
<b>Figure 1</b> shows the actual derived configuration for the aggregated data as a 
rotating .GIF file, allowing the reader to get a direct visceral sense of  
its 
geometry. <b>Figure 2</b> 
shows a simplified and stationary schematic diagram of the configuration. </p>


<p>[10] The intervals group along three arcs, forming what can be termed an 
&ldquo;octant right-triangle&rdquo; on the surface of a sphere&mdash;think of a triangle on  
the 
globe with one vertex at the North Pole and the other two along the Equator 
at zero and ninety degrees longitude, respectively. Along one side of this 
triangle are the intervals less than a tritone, while along a second side  
are the 
intervals greater than a tritone; the tritone itself lies at about the  
midpoint of 
the remaining side. If we were to project this triangle onto a Euclidean  
plane, 
as in <b>Figure 3</b>, 
 
then one axis of that planar projection could be easily interpreted as  
&ldquo;interval 
size in semitones.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the various dissonances (the 2nds, tritone, 
and 7ths) all group along that third side of the triangle, with the perfect 
consonances clustered near the opposite vertex; the imperfect consonances 
occur at approximately the midpoints of the connecting sides.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> On the 
planar projection of Figure 3, the other axis could then be easily  
interpreted as 
&ldquo;dissonance-class.&rdquo; Since the different types of 2nds, 3rds, 6ths, and 7ths 
cluster strongly together, some effect of &ldquo;diatonic interval type&rdquo; appears  
to 
operate as well. Thus, the interpretation of the derived configuration is an 
interaction of interval-size, interval-type, and dissonance-class.</p>


<p>[11] Note that this interpretation has not led to three independent factors, 
each determining one of the Euclidean axes of the configuration. In fact, 
attempting to do so leads to awkward (at best) formulations for the two axes 
that do not involve the dissonance-classes. The interaction interpretation 
given above, by contrast, appears to be clear and readily accounts for the 
features of the configuration. Keep in mind that the projection operation of 
the previous paragraph was done only to aid in understanding the nature of 
the three-dimensional configuration. Such a projection is not a legitimate 
operation in the sense of trying to reduce the number of dimensions needed 
for the configuration, even though in essence the configuration &ldquo;is&rdquo; two 
dimensional if we were operating in spherical geometry rather than 
Euclidean geometry&mdash;all MDS algorithms involve a Euclidean space. If one 
wants to see what sort of two-dimensional configuration is produced by the 
algorithm, one must have the algorithm compute such a configuration <i>ab 
initio.</i> Doing so for this data yields a noticeably different topology, as  
shown 
in <b>Figure 4</b>. 
 
</p>


<p>[12] Three-dimensional configurations were also obtained for the matrices  
for 
the various presentation modes by themselves. These configurations have 
the same overall topology as the aggregate data, with a few variations 
occurring in the clustering of individual pairs of intervals (e.g., minor and  
Major 3rd; Major 3rd &amp; Perfect 4th); the tritone is the most volatile in terms of  
moving 
around the various configurations, clustering closer to the 6ths when 
descending.

<p>[13] Of particular interest, we can derive the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; set of  
interval-classes 
from this configuration by a particular Euclidean planar projection of the 
configuration, shown in <b>Figure 5</b>. 
 
On this projection, ic6 lies on an axis of symmetry; the members of the  
other ics can be read off directly with increasing distance from that axis.  
Because we 
can find such a projection, this study thus provides some empirical support 
for the idea of interval-class as operating in psychological space. Remember 
again, however, that as a projection this does not tell the whole story, for 
which we must refer back to the complete configuration. 
</p>


<p>[14] As a check against the predictions of various theoretical  
possibilities, MDS 
was applied to similarity matrices developed for models based on: interval-class only; interval-size only; acoustical dissonance only; and  
interval-class 
plus interval size. The topologies of all of the resulting configurations  
were 
obviously different than that for the actual data.

<p>[15] As another comparison, the confusion matrices for the above-mentioned 
studies by Plomp et al. and Killam et al. were also analyzed by MDS. Both of 
those studies had included the octave as one of the intervals studied,  
unlike 
the current study; therefore, the data from those studies were analyzed in  
two 
ways&mdash;with the octave removed from consideration, and with it included. 
When the octave was omitted, the resulting topologies were fairly similar to 
that produced by the current data; when it was included, some non-trivial  
re-alignments took place. <b>Figure 6</b> provides a stereoscopic view of the 
configuration for Killam et al.&rsquo;s data with the octave removed, while <b>Figure 7</b> gives a stereoscopic view of the configuration when the octave was 
included.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> It is not clear why 
such realignments occur in the configuration when the octave is included; one 
initial speculation would be, some sort of conflict took place between factors 
of acoustical dissonance and overall interval size, but this would be just a 
guess. </p>


<p>[16] The rule of thumb for MDS studies is that data from a minimum of about 
30 subjects is needed in order to ensure a reliable solution. The current  
study 
falls just below that threshold, and thus begins to raise concerns about 
whether we should put any faith in the configuration obtained. Likewise, 
neither Killam et al.&rsquo;s nor Plomp et al.&rsquo;s studies meet this threshold.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
It is because all three configurations have the same overall topology (when the 
octave is excluded from consideration in the latter two) that it is possible to 
have any confidence in the current results; more thorough replications with 
larger subject samples are, of course, clearly needed. Also, it is critical that 
replications systematically include octaves and compound intervals: given that 
the configurations for the other studies change when the octave is included in 
the MDS analysis, we cannot assume that no new factors will appear when larger 
intervals are included.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
Furthermore, some means of including types of musical contexts will be necessary 
eventually, as opposed to testing similarity only in context-free situations as 
was done in all of the above studies: it would not be very surprising to learn 
that interval (and by extension, interval-class) similarity might change if a 
listener first heard several pieces dominated by whole-tone or octatonic 
textures rather than diatonic or chromatic tonal harmonies.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>


<p>[17] These MDS results have some mixed implications for atonal theory. 
Interval-class <i>does</i> appear to have some validity as a psychological 
construct, given that the pattern of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; interval-classes can be  
derived 
from the configuration. The very strong grouping of intervals by dissonance-class suggests that the different interval classes cannot be treated as  
being 
independent of each other for assessing chord similarity, however. Should 
the current results be supported by replications, then similarity functions  
that 
use the icv as the basis for their calculations will need revision in order  
to 
take these relationships into account. Of such functions, Scott and  
Isaacson&rsquo;s 
ANGLE measure is the best pre-positioned for any upgrade, since they already 
discuss how to alter the calculation of the function to take correlations of  
ics 
into account.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>


<p>[18] The idea that interval-classes cluster into several groups should not  
be 
particularly onerous. Indeed, the observed clustering matches a well-established taxonomy in music theory, of perfect consonances, imperfect 
consonances, and dissonances, so any resulting modification of atonal theory 
will likely align it more closely to certain ideas for tonal theory. This  
may 
seem to fly in the face of a basic aesthetic stance in atonal theory,  
though, in 
that there seems to be an unwritten rule among most atonal theorists that 
&ldquo;all intervals are created equal (but separate);&rdquo; to group interval-classes  
in 
a way so explicitly associated with functional tonality would appear to 
undermine all the work that has gone into developing atonal theory as an 
analytical subdiscipline entirely separate from tonal theory. Any such fear  
is a 
red herring, however. As Fred Lerdahl has stated on more than one occasion, 
&ldquo;One does not hear <i>Elektra</i> and <i>Erwartung</i> in entirely different ways. The 
historical development from tonality to atonality (and back) is richly 
continuous. Theories of tonal and atonal music should be comparably 
linked.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Further studies 
on the perceptual grouping of interval-class components, including how the 
octave and compound intervals fit into the overall picture, will help us develop 
such a linkage.</p>

degraded as stimulus duration was reduced, rather than any possible implications

transposition levels rather than the ten used in the present study, using an 
organ timbre; the stimuli were presented in two durations, of 100 and 200 
milliseconds. As in the present study, intervals were presented in all three 
presentation modes; while the authors provide some analysis separated by 
presentation mode, they only presented an aggregate confusion matrix. Plomp et al. used a sample of 15 music students; they used sine tones and 
sawtooth waves as timbres; the intervals were presented such that either the 
high or low notes of the intervals were always middle C or the C above, or else 
centered within that octave to the extent possible. The various intervals were 
thus presented different numbers of times (octaves could only be presented as C4 
to C5 and major 7ths could only be presented with C as one component, while the 
other intervals were presented in three different forms); while they detail some 
efforts to reduce any bias caused by such lopsidedness, their paper remains 
problematic.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> Indeed, given that in a number of undergraduate aural skills programs music 
majors receive little or no training on the recognition of compound intervals,

e.g., consumer product preference ratings.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">There is an entire family of MDS models for different situations, with differing 
limitations and requirements; a related set of techniques called cluster 
analysis also provides for visualization of similarity by generating tree 
diagrams instead of geometric configurations. See Joseph B. Kruskal and Myron 
Wish, <i>Multidimensional Scaling,</i> Sage University Paper Series on 
Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences, Series no. 07&ndash;011 (Newbury 
Park, CA and London: Sage Publications, 1978), for a basic introduction. Their 
short monograph discusses both the underlying mathematics as well as various 
important methodological issues that will not be discussed in this essay; such 
issues include determining the appropriate number of dimensions for the derived 
configurations (i.e., are three dimensions needed to adequately describe the 
relationships between the objects under investigation, or will two suffice?), 
and how to deal with any underlying asymmetries in the data (e.g., in a tonal 
context I&rarr;V will almost certainly be rated differently than V&rarr;I). I am 
currently finishing preparation on an article illustrating a different 
application of MDS for music-theoretic analysis that will include a detailed but 
non-technical tutorial about such issues.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">T. Jeffries, &ldquo;The Effects of Order of Presentation and Knowledge of Results on

Interval Discrimination,&rdquo; <i>Peabody Bulletin</i> vol. 28, no. 2 (1932): 45&ndash;46. Ortmann provides only qualitative bar graphs of confusion data for two intervals 
(i.e., he gives no indication as to whether the vertical axes should be 
interpreted as percentage of times the played interval was identified as this, 
that, or the other answer&mdash;and if so, what percentage&mdash;or as numbers of times it 
was so identified). Jeffries was concerned with how the presence of particular 
intervals before and after a target interval in specific melodic contexts 
affected how the target was identified; he presents his results in a couple of 
ways, but they again are qualitative, not quantitative, tables and diagrams.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Rosemary N. Killam, Paul V. Lorton, Jr., and Earl D. Schubert, &ldquo;Interval

Mimpen, &ldquo;Musical Interval Recognition with Simultaneous Tones,&rdquo; 
<i>Acustica</i> 29 (1973): 101&ndash;109. 
One slightly earlier study (W. J. M. Levelt, J. P. van der Geer, and  
R[einer] 
Plomp, &ldquo;Triadic Comparisons of Musical Intervals,&rdquo; <i>British Journal of 
Mathematical and Statistical Psychology</i> 19 [1966]: 163&ndash;179) actually carried 
out MDS analysis of data obtained by the triadic comparison method for intervals 
sounded as pure tones and as complex tones; that analysis appeared to show some 
support for the hypothesis of interval-class as a psychological construct. In my 
opinion, however, their paper contains significant methodological problems, 
which would be beyond the scope of the present article to critique in detail; 
the citation is given for those readers wishing to consult the work for 
themselves.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Thirty additional duplicate trials were inserted into the generated random 
orders, subject to the same constraints between consecutive trials, as a check 
for subjects&rsquo; self-consistency. There were thus 360 trials (18 blocks of 20) in 
total. One additional subject was eliminated from consideration for failing this 
check.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Art Samplaski, &ldquo;Interval and Interval-Class Similarity: Results from a Confusion 
Study,&rdquo; poster presentation at the 2003 meeting of the Society for Music

diagram in <a target='ex_window' href='samplaski_fig2.html' onClick='newwindow('samplaski_fig2.html',500,450); return false;'>Figure 2</a> is to aid visualization. It is parallel to the arc along 
which the dissonances lie.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">The configurations derived from Plomp et al.&rsquo;s data are not shown 
because of the minimal time for which their stimuli sounded&mdash;they did four 
experimental runs of stimuli with durations of 120, 60, 30, and 15(!) 
milliseconds respectively, only the longest of which is relevant to actual 
musical situations. Plomp et al. were concerned with how interval recognition 
degraded as stimulus duration was reduced, rather than any possible implications 
for theories of musical structure. It is thus all the more remarkable that the 
configuration for their data bears any resemblance at all to the other two.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Killam et al. used a sample of 15 undergraduate music majors; they tested at two 
transposition levels rather than the ten used in the present study, using an 
organ timbre; the stimuli were presented in two durations, of 100 and 200 
milliseconds. As in the present study, intervals were presented in all three 
presentation modes; while the authors provide some analysis separated by 
presentation mode, they only presented an aggregate confusion matrix. Plomp et al. used a sample of 15 music students; they used sine tones and 
sawtooth waves as timbres; the intervals were presented such that either the 
high or low notes of the intervals were always middle C or the C above, or else 
centered within that octave to the extent possible. The various intervals were 
thus presented different numbers of times (octaves could only be presented as C4 
to C5 and major 7ths could only be presented with C as one component, while the 
other intervals were presented in three different forms); while they detail some 
efforts to reduce any bias caused by such lopsidedness, their paper remains 
problematic.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Indeed, given that in a number of undergraduate aural skills programs music 
majors receive little or no training on the recognition of compound intervals, 
it is entirely possible that such MDS configurations could be chaotic jumbles if 
population samples of only undergraduates are used. This is a worst-case 
scenario, of course, but we have no way <i>a priori</i> to know what results 
might occur.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Again, we cannot be certain that this <i>would</i> be the case, although it may 
seem like a perfectly plausible scenario. In making pronouncements about 
empirical situations, there is no substitute for collecting actual data. Because 
the number of factors that might influence the results, and their possible 
interactions, proliferate rapidly in imbedded-context situations, it is more 
difficult to develop well-designed studies of such types&mdash;context-free studies 
must first be carried out to provide a baseline for follow-up research.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Scott and Isaacson, <i>op. cit.,</i> pages 136&ndash;39.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">The most recent such statement is <i>Tonal Pitch Space</i> (New York: Oxford
