The theory emphasizes how a given work is distinguished from other works in some musical corpus. A number of general concepts are defined including presence, salience, distinctiveness, and significance. Intratextual factors such as prevalence, primacy, and recency, are distinguished from intertextual factors such as evocation, quotation, allusion, parody, and model. The theory is illustrated by evaluating the principal motive proposed by Allen Forte in his study of Brahms&rsquo;s  opus 51, no. 1. Forte&rsquo;s  &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; interval-class set is shown to be unable to distinguish quartet No. 1 from other quartets by Brahms. On the basis of the theory, several refinements are made to Forte&rsquo;s  alpha feature. Only when the prime form of the interval-class pattern is joined with a long-short-long rhythm does the resulting feature become distinctive of the work. Perceptually-pertinent properties are shown to be helpful in assembling a distinctive feature definition.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>[1] Imagine that you were robbed by someone and were later asked by the police 
to provide a description of your assailant. Suppose you began your description by 
noting that the robber had a nose, two eyes, a mouth, and two ears. These &ldquo;facts&rdquo; 
would undoubtedly be &ldquo;true,&rdquo; but the police would be rightly dismayed by your description 
for the simple reason that the facts fail to distinguish your assailant from a world 
of potential suspects.</p>
<p>[2] When characterizing a musical work it is important, not simply to make accurate 
or truthful observations about its organization; but also to identify those characteristics 
that set the work apart from other musical works. In this paper, I will argue that 
music analyses can occasionally fall prey to such empty descriptive language. Like 
the description of our hypothetical robber, many otherwise truthful observations 
simply fail to be informative.</p>
<p>[3] The paper is divided into two parts. Part One begins with a general theoretical 
discussion concerning the notion of a &ldquo;feature.&rdquo; In the course of this discussion 
a number of properties of features will be distinguished and a set of corresponding 
terms defined. In Part Two, the concepts developed in Part One will be illustrated 
by referring to Allen Forte&rsquo;s discussion of motivic design in the first movement 
of Brahms&rsquo;s string quartet, opus 51, no. 1.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> In particular, the analysis will focus on what Forte identifies as the principal 
motivic feature of this work. Using the theoretical concepts related to features, 
several refinements will be made to Forte&rsquo;s motivic description. In effect, a &ldquo;nose&rdquo; 
will be transformed into an &ldquo;aquiline nose&rdquo;; &ldquo;two eyes&rdquo; will be transformed into &ldquo;close-set 
eyes.&rdquo; To anticipate our results, this systematic analytic path will ultimately 
lead us to a motivic description that closely resembles a traditional diatonic motive 
as the principal intratextual feature of this work.</p>
<p>[4] At the outset, it is important to reassure readers about the goal of this 
essay. The paper should not be regarded as an attack on Prof. Forte. Forte&rsquo;s 
motivic study simply provides a convenient illustration of a problem that is 
common in music analysis. My intention is simply to demonstrate that grievous 
problems of descriptive language are evident even in the work of renowned 
theorists&mdash;and to show that such problems are (at least in principle) avoidable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>PART ONE: WHAT IS A FEATURE?</b></p>

<p>[5] In common parlance, a &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is a notable or characteristic part of something; 
a feature is something that helps to distinguish one thing from another (or one 
group of things from another group of things). An architect, for example, can distinguish 
a Corinthian column from Doric and Ionic orders by the presence of sculpted acanthus 
leaves near the top of the column. We might say that sculpted leaves are a <i>feature</i> 
of the classic Corinthian column. In the analysis of artistic artifacts, features 
provide the essential descriptive primitives by which the unique characters of individual 
works may be identified, and by which the commonalities of styles, periods, and 
genres may be portrayed. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Properties of Features</b></p>

<p>[6] At a minimum, we might expect a proposed feature to be <i>present</i> in 
an artifact or class of artifacts. If it is claimed that <i>X</i> is a feature of 
work <i>Y,</i> then we would naturally expect <i>X</i> to be located, or evident 
in <i>Y</i>. Sometimes features may be notable by their absence, however. For example, 
the absence of harmonic thirds and sixths in a tonal-period work would be something 
of an aberration. Since, the absence of something commonplace may itself be noteworthy, 
we might refer to this property as <i>negative presence.</i> Note that negative 
presence presupposes the existence of a normative repertoire or established set 
of expectations. That is, one can&rsquo;t recognize that something is missing unless one 
has a sense of what is normally present. </p>
<p>[7] In the arts, it is common to focus on the work of art as the object of analysis. 
This focus allows a distinction to be made between those features that arise within 
the context of the work itself (<i>intratextual</i>) and those that arise from relationships 
between works (<i>intertextual</i>). Both positive presences and negative presences 
may be either intertextual or intratextual. An intertextual negative presence arises 
when the accumulated evidence suggests that a work belongs to a certain class of 
works, yet fails to exhibit a property that is otherwise assumed to be essential 
to membership in that class or group. By contrast, an intratextual negative presence 
arises within a work when the work itself establishes the expectation of some event 
or phenomenon that nevertheless remains unrealized. Since the thwarting of an expectation 
may quickly become a clich&eacute;, intratextual features are constantly being transformed 
into intertextual norms.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Descriptive Languages</b></p>

<p>[8] In describing features, an important consideration is the nature of the descriptive 
language used. Note that even in the case of positive presences, a proposed feature 
is rarely directly represented in an artistic artifact. For example, the pitches 
of a score do not directly encode the melodic intervals. The concept of &ldquo;melodic 
interval&rdquo; relies on the assumption of an underlying &ldquo;voice&rdquo; or &ldquo;part&rdquo; and deciphering 
voicing sometimes entails remarkably sophisticated interpretations. On what basis, 
then, can one defend the assumption of <i>voice?</i> Those theorists who have contemplated 
such matters typically rely on one of two appeals. One might appeal to notational 
conventions such as the use of separate staves or differentiation via stem direction. 
A more common appeal is to the perceptual experiences that affirm the subjective 
phenomenon of &ldquo;musical line&rdquo; and hence of &ldquo;melodic interval.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> We often assume that the notational conventions of stem directions and independent 
staves are straightforward reflections of a common psychological experience. That 
is, theorists rightly consider melodic intervals to be implied by individual successive 
pitches, and rightly assume that such intervals may be readily derived in most circumstances.</p>
<p>[9] In fact, few features can be identified in the &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; of an artifact. 
Like melodic intervals, most features are deciphered, interpreted, or derived from 
the object of analysis. Of course, even the &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; are interpreted. What makes 
the data seem ontologically &ldquo;raw&rdquo; is that the interpretations are comparatively 
stable and uncontentious. We can continue to use such terms as &ldquo;raw data&rdquo; as a linguistic 
convenience, although the term should be understood as a short-hand for <i>interpretations 
that are less contentious</i>&mdash;and the term should never be seen as a foundation 
that is immune to further conceptual analysis or challenge.</p>
<p>[10] Of course, derived presences may be much more indirect than is the case 
for melodic intervals. Derived presences may include such concepts as deceptive 
cadences, prolongations, syncopations, suspensions, ritornellos, and other phenomena. 
Often, these derived concepts are more notable and compelling features than directly 
notated pitches or durations.</p>
<p>[11] Note that there are an infinite number of possible derived presences, and 
not all such derivatives can have the same analytic status. For example, one might 
rigorously define the property <i>fuddle</i> to be the semitone pitch distance between 
the second-last notes occurring in odd numbered measures whose stem directions extend 
upward. Implicit in any descriptive language is the idea that the descriptive terms 
(such as &ldquo;melodic interval&rdquo;) are not reified concepts, and that, unlike the concept 
of <i>fuddle,</i> they represent some organizing principle that has influenced either 
the construction of the work, or its reception, or both. In the case of conventional 
tonal theory, the notion of a diatonic step is an example of such a derivative concept. 
In the case of set theory, the notion of an interval-class is an example of such 
a concept.</p>
<p>[12] In discussing above how theorists might defend the traditional <i>voice</i> 
assumption underlying the concept of the melodic interval, two different forms of 
justification were cited. One was based on subjective perceptual experience, and 
the other was based on notational practice. It is important to understand that these 
are just two of innumerable forms of appeals. One need not refer either to perception 
or to the notation in order to justify a useful descriptive concept. Consider, by 
way of illustration, the notion of something being &ldquo;idiomatic.&rdquo; In works written 
for trumpet, it has been observed that difficult finger/valve combinations are systematically 
less common in works written by trumpet virtuosi than in trumpet works written by 
non-virtuosi.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> In most circumstances, 
it is only the experienced trumpet player who is able to apprehend the specific 
properties that distinguish an idiomatic arrangement from an unidiomatic arrangement. 
That is, a trumpet player may experience a passage according to such categories 
as &ldquo;easy to finger&rdquo; or &ldquo;difficult to finger.&rdquo; Moreover, these conceptual and descriptive 
categories can be defended, even if listeners are unable to perceive them, even 
if non-trumpet performers fail to experience them, and even if theorists are oblivious 
to their existence.</p>
<p>[13] Descriptive languages are often unique to particular communities. Usually, 
the language is largely given <i>a priori,</i> but there are always opportunities 
to change or expand the descriptive conceptual vocabulary. A composer might choose 
to create a work whose organization is intimately linked to the <i>fuddle</i> concept. 
If this were the case, this aspect of the music&rsquo;s organization would have salience 
only for readers of this article&mdash;and even then, only for readers with access to 
the notated score. This simply illustrates that useful descriptive concepts can 
spring into existence within a given community or culture.</p>
<p>[14] When we describe features, we are at liberty to choose the descriptive language, 
although the language must contain concepts whose assumptions have some degree of 
support. In describing a robber to the police, an optician might focus on the robber&rsquo;s 
brand of eyeglasses, a fashion designer might focus on features of the robber&rsquo;s 
clothing, and a dialect expert might focus on the robber&rsquo;s manner of speech. Within 
each of these descriptive domains, however, it is still possible to give either 
fruitful or empty descriptions. The optician&rsquo;s recognition of a common brand of 
sunglasses, the fashion designer&rsquo;s notice of poor color-coordination, and the dialect 
expert&rsquo;s animated description of the robber&rsquo;s impolite vocabulary may be of little 
use in distinguishing our robber from anyone else.</p>
<p>[15] In identifying a feature, we must always be cognizant of the question &ldquo;feature 
of what?&rdquo; Features may be characteristic of a work, of a movement, of a composer, 
of a style, of tonal music in general, and so forth. What constitutes a feature 
depends on the scope of our gaze. For example, a non-Western listener may deem the 
sound of the pianoforte to be a significant feature of Western music&mdash;without distinguishing 
any further divisions. To the music analyst, the features of principal interest 
have been those that characterize individual works, or sections thereof. At the 
supra-opus level, features of interest may include stylistic features, the three 
basic lines of Schenkerian analysis, and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Salience</b></p>

<p>[16] The mere presence of some element or property does not necessarily make 
it a good feature. A good feature must in some ways draw attention to itself. It 
must be notable, or what might be dubbed <i>salient.</i> Of course there are innumerable 
ways by which something may draw attention&mdash;some of which we will discuss later. 
One of the most venerable properties is the simple <i>prevalence</i> of an event; 
that is, how frequently a pattern recurs.</p>
<p>[17] Apart from such intratextual factors, there are also intertextual factors 
that can contribute to salience. A single statement of &ldquo;B&ndash;A&ndash;C&ndash;H&rdquo; or the opening 
notes of <i>Dies Irae</i> can be sufficient to establish the notability of the event. 
Intertextual factors may be either intentional or unintentional on the part of the 
artist. Intentional factors may include <i>quotation, allusion, parody</i>, and
<i>model</i>&mdash;concepts that have received some lucid theoretical attention.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> To these may be added the concept of <i>evocation</i> where a passage unintentionally 
reminds the listener of a similar passage in another work. (Since evocation is defined 
as unintentional, the clearest examples occur where a musical passage reminds us 
of a similar passage in a work created much later by another composer.)</p>
<p>[18] To summarize, we may define salience as a heightened attention that can 
arise due to either intratextual factors (such as phenomenal accent) or intertextual 
factors (such as quotation).</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Evaluation of Features</b></p>

<p>[19] All scholarly disciplines are founded on some type of descriptive enterprise. 
Features provide the essential building-blocks for such descriptions. Each discipline 
establishes its own criteria for good description; however, some evaluative criteria 
are nearly universal and possibly tautological. Perhaps the most important property 
of a description is the degree to which it distinguishes the objects of our attention 
from other (possibly like) objects. If the goal of an analytic description is to 
convey what is unique or distinctive of a given object or class of objects, then 
good features must embody or define some of that distinctiveness.</p>
<p>[20] Another important property of feature descriptions is the economy of the 
means of expression. When asked for directions by a passing motorist, the success 
of our description depends not only on the distinctiveness of the landmarks we mention, 
but also&mdash;since human memory is fallible&mdash;on the brevity of our description. Of 
course, in giving directions to our motorist, we might ask if they are already familiar 
with certain landmarks. In inquiring about their existing knowledge, we are, in 
effect, determining whether intertextual references will have any value in enhancing 
the description. Whether or not our motorist has knowledge of the pertinent geography, 
a good description will identify a succinct set of distinctive features.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>[21] In the absence of distinctiveness, many otherwise truthful characterizations 
are without merit due to the excessive breadth of the description. In concrete terms, 
we may define <i>distinctiveness</i> as the property of &ldquo;relative salience&rdquo;&mdash;that 
is, where a feature is more characteristic of the artifact being described compared 
with other artifacts or phenomena. Note that the property of distinctiveness is 
necessarily comparative.</p>
<p>[22] Once again, what constitutes a distinctive feature depends on the scope 
of our gaze. A &ldquo;nose&rdquo; is a feature of faces in general, but the presence of a nose 
cannot be a feature of a particular face. It is the &ldquo;stubby nose&rdquo; or the &ldquo;pixie 
nose&rdquo; that may be a feature of some given face&mdash;but only because of the implied 
comparison with other noses.</p>
<p>[23] All of the foregoing attributes or properties of a feature are attempts 
to approach the central issue related to a feature: its importance, eminence, or
<i>significance</i>. By their very nature, the concepts of importance and significance 
are open-ended. A single, apparently trivial detail may be the source of a striking 
story. Significance is always contextual, and there is no telling the historical, 
social, personal, formal or other domains that establish the context for some event&mdash;however 
apparently minor or inconsequential. This means that it is impossible, in principle, 
to produce an exhaustive inventory of the significant features of some work. </p>

<p>[24] Although we cannot describe <i>all</i> the potentially significant features 
of a work, or even <i>the most</i> significant features of a work, this does not 
preclude the possibility of identifying <i>some</i> features that are significant. 
My claim here is that salient distinctive features will always bear some degree 
of significance in a work&mdash;even though other features may exist that can claim to 
be of greater significance. </p>


<p>[25] By way of summary, the feature-related properties we have discussed are 
reproduced in <b>Table 1</b>. In general, a good feature may be defined as a succinct description 
that is salient, distinctive, and significant. That is, a good feature is something 
that attracts our attention in some way, that distinguishes an object or class of 
objects from other like objects, and that is worthy of interest. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>PART TWO: FEATURES IN BRAHMS&rsquo;S OPUS 51, NO. 1</b></p>

<p>[26] The conceptual framework outlined in Part One may be better understood through 
an illustrative example. <b>Example 1</b> shows the opening measures of the first movement 
of Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51, no. 1. The opening statement in the first violin part constitutes 
what would normally, and informally, be dubbed the principal theme of this movement&mdash;a 
theme that Hanslick characterized as &ldquo;magnificently passionate.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> <b>Example 2</b> shows a number of interval-related groups that are identified in Forte&rsquo;s 
analysis as playing a central role in this movement.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> The most important of these sets is the interval sequence (+2,+1) which, along with 
its inversion (-2,-1), retrograde (+1,+2), and retrograde inversion (-1,-2), Forte 
dubs the &ldquo;alpha&rdquo; group of motives. In order to distinguish the interval patterns 
from the interval-class patterns we will use the unsigned designation (2,1) to refer 
to the interval-class pattern that embodies all four of these individual interval 
patterns. </p>

<p>[27] There is no question that the alpha pattern is <i>present</i> in opus 51, 
no. 1. The pattern occurs in the opening three notes of the first violin and appears 
numerous times throughout the movement. According to our analytic taxonomy, we need 
to consider the degree to which occurrences of this pattern are <i>salient</i> and
<i>distinctive.</i></p>
<p>[28] Of the various factors contributing to salience, consider first the simple 
property of <i>prevalence.</i> Out of 7,045 interval-class melodic dyads found in 
this movement, the alpha pattern is the most common interval-class pattern, occurring 
352 times. (The prime form alone occurs 136 times making it the 13th most common 
two-interval pattern.)<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>[29] However, since scale-like movements of tones and semitones are ubiquitous 
in tonal music, we might well expect the alpha pattern to be common in most musical 
works. Returning to our police station analogy, suppose that we remain unconvinced 
by the police officer&rsquo;s protestations that saying our assailant &ldquo;has a nose&rdquo; is 
utterly vacuous. The officer might pull out a college yearbook and ask us to count 
the number of photographs where a person is without a nose. Having counted a large 
number of people, each with a nose, we might be more convinced that our description 
does indeed fail to be distinctive. Such a statistical demonstration might seem 
crude or unwarranted, but it serves the important purpose of establishing the shortcomings 
of our description.</p>
<p>[30] In order to determine whether the alpha pattern is <i>distinctive</i> of 
the first movement of opus 51, no. 1, we need to compare this movement with other 
musical works. But what other works would provide an appropriate comparison? If 
we compared Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51 to (say) a Brazilian samba,<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> then the origins of any observed differences between the two pieces would be difficult 
to interpret. Perhaps the differences would arise due to different historical periods, 
or different nationalities of the composers, or different instrumentation, or different 
styles. In other words, the observed differences may be manifestations of different 
classes of compositions (such as genres) rather than differences in the works themselves.</p>
<p>[31] In order to minimize these interpretive problems it is preferable to select 
comparison works that are as similar as possible to the work we are attempting to 
describe. A good sample of music for such a comparison is all of Brahms&rsquo;s remaining 
string quartet movements. Brahms claimed to have written over 20 string quartets 
in his youth&mdash;works which he later destroyed. Of his mature string quartets, Brahms 
published three: opus 51, no. 1; opus 51, no. 2; and opus 67. These works were written 
over a period of about a decade. By choosing this repertoire, we can be confident 
in dismissing claims that any differences we may observe are due to different composers, 
nationalities, genres, styles, instrumentation, etc. That is, any observable differences 
are more likely attributable to the different characters of the <i>works.</i> Of 
course the string quartet movements are not exactly &ldquo;matched&rdquo;&mdash;there remain differences. 
The various movements exhibit different tempi, forms, and moods. Rather than comparing 
the first movement of Quartet No. 1 with the other movements of the same work, in 
some ways, a better comparison might be to compare the first movements from all 
three quartets (No. 1: Allegro, 3/2 meter; No. 2: Allegro non troppo, 2/2 meter; 
and No. 3: Vivace, 6/8 meter). The different meters and the different keys mean 
that we cannot dismiss the possibility that any observed differences can be attributed 
to these factors.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 2</b>. Prevalence of &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; Patterns in First Movements of Brahms&rsquo;s String Quartets</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="huron_examples.php?id=3&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 2 thumbnail" src="huron_table2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[32] <b>Table 2</b> tabulates the number of occurrences of each of the alpha patterns 
for each of the first movements of Brahms&rsquo;s three string quartets. Separate results 
are shown for all four set variants of Forte&rsquo;s interval-class motive.</p>

<p>[33] The results of Table 2 show that the alpha interval-class pattern is prevalent 
in all three quartet movements&mdash;not just in the first movement of quartet No. 1. 
In fact, the alpha interval-class pattern is proportionally more common in each 
of the other string quartet movements than it is in quartet No. 1. This implies 
(but does not prove) that the alpha interval-class is a musical commonplace&mdash;at 
least in the case of Brahms, but probably for tonal music in general. In summary, 
we can say that the alpha interval-class pattern is <i>present</i> and <i>prevalent</i> 
in quartet No. 1, but, on the basis of this single salience factor, we cannot say 
that alpha is <i>distinctive</i> of quartet No. 1.</p>
<p>[34] As we noted earlier, a good feature must draw attention to itself in some 
way. Apart from simple repetition (prevalence), there are innumerable other ways 
to draw attention. If we trust Forte&rsquo;s intuition, we must conclude that more than 
mere prevalence contributed to Forte&rsquo;s selection of the alpha motive. We need to 
look for other possible salience-enhancing properties. One place to begin is by 
noting that Forte selected the initial three notes of the work. In memory and learning 
tasks, psychologists have established that the first visual or auditory items in 
a sequence are more salient than other items&mdash;a phenomenon dubbed <i>primacy.</i> 
(Similarly, people are better at recalling and learning items toward the end of 
a sequence&mdash;a phenomenon known as <i>recency</i>.)</p>
<p>[35] We might also note that Forte chose the upper-most voice, rather than, say, 
the initial notes in the viola part. We can only guess as to the source of Forte&rsquo;s 
intuition, but it is suggestive that this choice also accords with experimental 
research showing that listeners find outer voices, especially the upper-most voice, 
more perceptually salient.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> While 
we are considering these salience-enhancing treatments, let&rsquo;s consider some other 
common ones. On the most superficial level, salience can be enhanced by increasing 
the amount of acoustical energy (e.g., loudness and/or duration) that attends some 
event. All types of foreground accent (dynamic, agogic, melodic, etc.) can contribute 
to salience.</p>
<p>[36] Perhaps it is the case that alpha tends to occur in foreground or melody 
parts rather than in accompaniment contexts. Motivic statements might tend to be 
presented via unison or octave doublings, or appear in outer-voice parts. Various 
forms of accent may be applied; statements may coincide with metrically strong positions. 
The feature might be isolated from preceding and ensuing material; it might tend 
to appear at the beginning and ending of the work, or at the beginnings and ends 
of phrases.</p>

<p>[37] Tables 3a-f show the results of six exploratory analyses that attempt to 
determine the extent to which Forte&rsquo;s alpha patterns are linked with various contextual 
treatments that may be expected to enhance salience. <b>Table 3a</b> shows the number of 
instances of the alpha patterns that involve pitch-class doublings (such as unison 
or octave statements). <b>Table 3b</b> shows the number of instances of the alpha patterns 
that follow a rest (implying perceptual primacy). <b>Table 3c</b> shows the number of instances 
of the alpha patterns that precede a rest (implying perceptual recency). <b>Table 3d</b> 
shows the number of instances of the alpha patterns that coincide with the beginning 
of a phrase or slur mark (also implying primacy). <b>Table 3e</b> shows the number of instances 
of the alpha patterns that begin on the strongest metric position (down-beat) in 
a measure. <b>Table 3f</b> shows the number of instances of the alpha patterns that occur 
in outer voices (&rsquo;cello and first violin). In each case, the results for opus 51, 
no. 1, are contrasted with similar tallies for the first movements of Brahms&rsquo;s other 
two string quartets.</p>

<p>[38] Each table entry identifies the number of instances found, followed (in 
parentheses) by the rank position of that pattern in a list of all patterns in the 
movement&mdash;ordered by frequency of occurrence. Summary statistics for each of the 
three quartet movements are provided at the bottom of each table. Specifically, 
the total number of alpha-related patterns are tabulated, followed (in parentheses) 
by the percent occurrence. The total numbers of pertinent measures are also identified 
followed by measures of the total number of unique patterns conforming to the defined 
context.</p>

<p>[39] Consider first the summary statistics in each table showing the totals for 
all four interval patterns. In particular, compare the percentage occurrences for 
all three quartet movements. Tables 3a, 3b, 3c and 3f do not show any comparative 
coincidence between occurrences of alpha and pitch-class doubling, adjacent rest 
boundaries, or outer-voice positions. For example, Table 3a shows that only 1.72% 
of the alpha interval-class occurrences involved pitch-class doublings, whereas 
quartets No. 2 and No. 3 exhibited 1.83% and 7.26% respectively. However, Tables 
3d and 3e appear to show a heightened occurrence of the alpha interval-class motive 
coinciding with slur or phrase onsets and beginning in down-beat metric positions&mdash;compared 
to the other two quartets.</p>
<p>[40] The results shown in Tables 3a-f are more telling if we focus separately 
on the four individual interval patterns subsumed by Forte&rsquo;s alpha interval-class 
pattern, <b>Tables 4a-d</b> recast the data in Tables 3a-f comparing the results for each 
of the string quartet movements for each of the four interval patterns: (a) the 
prime interval-pattern (+2,+1), (b) the inversion (-2,-1), (c) the retrograde (-1,-2), 
and (d) the retrograde inversion (+1,+2). Only the prime form (+2,+1) in <b>Table 4a</b> 
shows a significant increased presence compared with the comparison movements.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> With the exception of the pitch-class doubling context, the (+2,+1) interval-pattern 
is linked with each of the examined salience-enhancing contexts much more often 
than for the other quartets. That is, the (+2,+1) interval pattern is more likely 
to be preceded or followed by a rest, is more apt to coincide with the beginning 
of a slur or phrase mark, is more apt to begin a measure, and is more apt to appear 
in an outer voice.</p>

<p>[41] Tables 4a-d suggest that it is not the alpha interval-class pattern that 
is distinctive of the first movement of Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51, no. 1; rather the results 
suggest that it is the interval-specific form (+2,+1) that is distinctive. This 
is not to suggest that motivic inversions (for example) don&rsquo;t appear in the movement. 
(Salient inverted statements clearly appear in measures 92&ndash;105.) It is only to say 
that the inversion is a rare variation of a more basic feature. It is appropriate 
then that Forte identifies the interval-specific pattern (+2,+1) as the <i>prime</i> 
form of the interval-class set&mdash;and uses this term in preference to the proper normal 
form (1,2). However, the retrograde, inversion, and retrograde inversion forms lack 
distinctiveness in this movement. </p>

<p>[42] If we wish to improve upon Forte&rsquo;s alpha feature, we need to consider how 
the feature description can be modified or extended such that it will truly become 
clearly <i>distinctive</i> rather than merely <i>prevalent.</i> There are a number 
of candidate ideas for modifying the feature description. One of the most important 
candidates is to consider the relationship between pitch and duration. For example, 
the three notes of Forte&rsquo;s alpha motive seem to be linked to a long-short-long rhythm. 
This suggests that we re-analyze the work with regard to patterns consisting of 
both interval dyad and relative duration. We might begin by first analyzing the 
long/short duration patterns in the three first movements in order to see if the 
long-short-long pattern is present, prevalent, and distinctive of opus 51, no. 1. 
All of the rhythmic-dyad patterns are shown in <b>Table 5</b>.</p>

<p>[43] In Table 5, the absolute duration of the notes has been of no concern; rather, 
a duration is deemed to be long or short depending upon the length of the preceding 
note. Thus the patterns &ldquo;half-quarter-whole&rdquo; and &ldquo;half-eighth-quarter&rdquo; would both 
be deemed long-short-long rhythms despite the fact that the quarter-duration is 
deemed &ldquo;short&rdquo; in the first pattern and &ldquo;long&rdquo; in the second pattern. Of course, 
this is only one of many possible approaches to characterizing rhythmic patterns, 
but we need to start somewhere.</p>
<p>[44] Table 5 indeed appears to suggest that the long-short-long pattern (i.e., 
&ldquo;shorter-longer&rdquo;) is more prevalent in the first movement of string quartet No. 
1 than in the first movements of Brahms&rsquo;s two other quartets. The pattern appears 
600 times out of 5,762 contiguous 3-note instances in quartet No. 1 (i.e., 10.4% 
of all instances). The corresponding percentages for quartets Nos. 2 and 3 are 8.1% 
and 5.0%, respectively. We now need to consider possible relationships between this 
potential rhythmic feature and the alpha interval pattern.</p>

<p>[45] <b>Tables 6a-c</b> show the durational contexts of the alpha interval patterns 
for each of the first movements of the three Brahms string quartets. Some patterns 
(such as longer-longer and shorter-shorter) are notably rare. The important question 
is whether the alpha patterns in quartet No. 1 are more strongly linked to the shorter-longer 
(i.e. long-short-long) rhythmic contour. The answer is a resounding yes. But once 
again, the answer must be qualified to say that only the interval-specific pattern 
(+2,+1) is strongly linked to the shorter-longer durational pattern. The remaining 
interval-specific patterns display no more rhythmic linkage than is found in the 
other quartets.</p>

<p>[46] An association or link between two parameters may be either unidirecitonal 
or bi-directional. For example, if we find that people with <i>X</i>-colored hair 
tend to have <i>Y</i>-colored eyes, it does not necessarily follow that people with
<i>Y</i>-colored eyes tend to have <i>X</i>-colored hair. When two characteristics 
are reciprocally linked they form a bi-direction association. Bi-directional associations 
are especially noteworthy since they imply a common source or origin for both characteristics 
or parameters. The preceding tables (6a-c) established only that the (+2,+1) interval 
pattern has a strong tendency to occur in a long-short-long (shorter-longer) durational 
context. We should also determine whether shorter-longer durational patterns tend 
to coincide with the (+2,+1) interval context.</p>

<p>[47] <b>Table 7</b> shows the dozen most prevalent interval patterns exhibiting the 
shorter-longer durations in the first movement of quartet No. 1. As can be seen, 
the interval-specific (+2,+1) pattern is ranked first. The other set variants for 
alpha are not shown in Table 7 due to their especially low rankings&mdash;27th (-2,-1), 
42nd (-1,-2), and 58th (+1,+2). In summary, Tables 6a and 7 show that the bond between 
the interval pattern (+2,+1) and the long-short-long rhythm is both strong and bi-directional. 
This linkage suggests that the interval and rhythm attributes share a common origin 
and are inextricable components of a <i>single</i> pattern. This finding suggests 
that it would be inappropriate to define the interval feature independent of its 
rhythmic properties. By contrast, none of the other set variants shows any such 
rhythmic linkage. For example, a separate analysis of the retrograde forms of alpha 
showed no correlation with retrograde forms of the rhythm.</p>

<p>[48] Further inspection of Table 7 reveals that the dozen or so most prevalent 
patterns show a marked predominance for ascending intervals. This bias toward ascending 
pitch sequences is confirmed in <b>Table 8</b>. Table 8 tabulates the predominance of all
<i>up-up, up-down, down-up,</i> and <i>down-down</i> pitch contours in opus 51, 
no. 1. Of 553 interval dyads (pitch triads), nearly 40 percent are solely upward 
in their contours&mdash;twice as many occurrences as the <i>down-down</i> contour. This 
suggests that the specific interval sizes may be less important in our feature definition 
than we might think. The right-most column of Table 8 shows the number of occurrences 
of the various contours&mdash;where all of the alpha interval-class occurrences have 
been excluded. As can be seen, the <i>up-up</i> pattern continues to predominate. 
In other words, the <i>up-up</i> pattern remains prevalent in this movement independent 
of the alpha interval patterns.</p>

<p>[49] Returning to Table 7, we can see that the second- and third-ranked patterns 
outline the minor third interval&mdash;an interval that Forte also highlights in his 
analysis. Forte doesn&rsquo;t explicitly comment on the relationship between the ascending 
minor third and the omission of the second note of the alpha pattern. The foregoing 
analysis allows us to be more explicit about their relationship. When viewed in 
its rhythmic-metric context, the elimination of the second pitch is hardly enigmatic. 
Recall that Table 3e established that the alpha pattern is more likely to begin 
on a strong metric position compared with Brahms&rsquo;s other quartets. In addition, 
we have seen that the alpha patterns are associated with a long-short-long rhythm. 
This implies that the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; note of (+2,+1) has been treated as a dispensable 
&ldquo;unaccented passing tone&rdquo;&mdash;the omission of which leads quite naturally to a rising 
minor third.</p>
<p>[50] The sixth- and eighth-ranked patterns in Table 7 show what can only be 
interpreted as upward rising major and minor triads, whereas the seventh-ranked 
pattern corresponds to clear statements of the upward rising motive in the major 
mode (i.e., measures 232 to 260). At the time of Forte&rsquo;s writing, the vocabulary 
of set theory was unable to accommodate diatonic intervals, and so the (+2,+2) 
interval pattern was defined as a separate motive (Forte&rsquo;s epsilon motive, see 
Example 2). </p>
<p>[51] With regard to diatonic intervals, a further analysis found that all of 
the instances of the prime form of alpha occurring in the first movement of quartet 
No. 1 are spelled as an ascending major second followed by an ascending minor second. 
By contrast, nearly ten percent of the alpha retrograde instances are spelled enharmonically 
as diminished thirds followed by minor seconds.</p>

Schematic Representation of the Principal Motive in Brahms Op. 51, No. 1, mvt. 1 as Developed Using a Comparative Analysis Method</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="huron_examples.php?id=20&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 3 thumbnail" src="huron_ex3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[52] In light of the above analyses, we can now summarize the state of our alternative 
motivic description of the principal foreground feature in the first movement of 
Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51, no. 1. The feature consists of pitches in an upward-rising sequence, 
linked to a long-short-long rhythm, generally starting a phrase or slur, often following 
a rest, beginning in a strong metric position, and most likely to occur in an outer 
voice. (See <b>Example 3</b>.)</p>

<p>[53] The feature bears more than a superficial resemblance to the opening statement 
in the first violin. In traditional tonal theory, this feature would have been informally 
labeled &ldquo;the principal motive.&rdquo; The above comparative analysis has merely formalized 
the evidence in support of this informal intuition.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Some Caveats</b></p>

<p>[54] It is important not to draw the wrong conclusion from the foregoing 
analysis. The analytic results, coupled with Forte&rsquo;s penchant for using the 
language of interval-class sets, is apt to remind readers of three old 
criticisms of set theory: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Set theory fails to account for rhythmic aspects of the music.</li>
  <li>Set theory specifies intervallic sizes that are inappropriately fixed and 
  overlooks the essentially diatonic contexts of the intervals. And</li>
  <li>Set theory implies an equivalent or enhanced status for the retrograde, inversion, 
  and retrograde inversion forms of the feature that are often not borne out by 
  the work itself. </li>
</ol>
<p>According to the view presented in this paper however, the above criticisms are 
merely artifacts of a more fundamental problem. The nub of the problem with the 
alpha pattern is that it fails to define a feature that will distinguish the first 
movement of quartet No. 1 from the first movements of Brahms&rsquo;s other two string 
quartets. That is, the alpha pattern is akin to describing a robber as having a 
nose and two eyes.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup><sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup><p></p>

<p>[55] Although Forte&rsquo;s study of Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51, no. 1, is not intended to be 
a set-theoretic analysis, the above three criticisms are indeed warranted. But they 
are not warranted because rhythm is inherently important, diatonic intervals are 
privileged, or set theory exhibits a bias toward certain set variants. There is 
no telling how any given work may distinguish itself: rhythm may or may not be important, 
diatonic intervals may or may not be important, and set variants may or may not 
be important. In our analysis, these properties became important simply because 
they help to define a feature description that distinguishes the object under consideration 
from other similar objects. That is, the process of contrasting the work in question 
with similar works allowed us to both refine and discard elements of our descriptive 
language. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Review of Analytic Assumptions</b></p>

<p>[56] In presenting the above comparative analysis, there are a number of caveats 
and disclaimers that must be made explicit. First, it is important to recognize 
that the above analysis dealt only with intratextual elements and did not consider 
possible intertextual features to opus 51, no. 1. It is always possible that intertextual 
properties overshadow the intratextual elements. As noted earlier, a single statement 
of, say, &ldquo;B&ndash;A&ndash;C&ndash;H&rdquo; may prove to be of great significance, even though such a statement 
may not be prevalent. Forte proposes a plausible (and fascinating) intertextual 
property of this movement when he links the C minor/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> minor key relations of the 
first and second subjects to those of the opening movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s opus 13 
piano sonata (<i>Path&eacute;tique</i>). This observation is consistent with the view that 
Beethoven&rsquo;s work provided a model for Brahms&rsquo;s writing. </p>
<p>[57] Second, only a handful of salience-enhancing properties were explored in 
the foregoing analysis. Specifically, we examined prevalence, metric position, relative 
duration, voice position, primacy, and recency-linked properties. In the specific 
case of metric and primacy properties, there are alternative ways of measuring such 
properties&mdash;other than those used in this paper. Other accent types (such as melodic 
accent), and mnemonic properties were not explored in the above analysis. In addition, 
other ways of characterizing features&mdash;such as scale-degree, diatonic interval (rather 
than semitone intervals), or relative interval size (e.g., step/leap)&mdash;were not 
explored. Rather than investigating long/short durational relations, a better rhythmic 
feature might arise from characterizing the precise durational proportions (e.g., 
the 3:1 ratio of the dotted rhythm). Any of these alternative approaches might lead 
to a better feature description than the one exemplified in Example 3. </p>
<p>[58] Third, the above analysis was restricted to foreground features only. In 
principle, however, the same comparative methodology can be used to evaluate claims 
of background features. In the case of Schenkerian analysis, this approach must 
await some computable implementation&mdash;if this is possible.</p>
<p>[59] Fourth, the above claims are limited by the comparison group of works. The 
failure of the alpha pattern to distinguish Quartet No. 1 from Brahms&rsquo;s other string 
quartets does not mean it is not a distinctive feature of some larger group of objects. 
For example, the original alpha pattern might distinguish Brahms&rsquo;s string quartets 
from works by other composers, or other works by Brahms. Or it may be that the alpha 
pattern is characteristic of Brahms in general, or of Western tonal music compared 
to other types of music.</p>
<p>[60] Once again it bears emphasizing that the motivic feature shown in Example 
3 is not claimed to be the &ldquo;best&rdquo; intratextual feature in opus 51, no. 1. In principle, 
it is impossible to determine the best feature, since there may always be some analytic 
perspective that provides a more penetrating characterization. My claim is merely 
that our refined feature is better than Forte&rsquo;s original alpha motive. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>[61] The identification of features is one of the essential tasks of any descriptive 
enterprise. Purported features can be characterized according to their presence, 
salience, distinctiveness, and significance. In the first instance, what constitutes 
a feature depends on the scope of our gaze. A feature might pertain to a particular 
musical passage, a movement, work, composer, period, genre, style or culture. Features 
may be salient because of intratextual or intertextual treatments&mdash;including prevalence, 
primacy, recency, evocation, quotation, allusion, parody, and model.</p>
<p>[62] When making observations about music, the analyst is free to choose or construct 
any descriptive language. However, the value of the resulting description can be 
evaluated only by inviting the possibility of failure. At a minimum, one needs to 
discern whether the description offered succeeds in distinguishing the object of 
interest from other similar objects. It is surprisingly easy to inadvertently describe 
features that may be characteristic of music in general while wrongly supposing 
that one is describing features of a particular work. Similarly, one might wrongly 
assume that descriptions of a single work pertain to an entire class of works. In 
this paper we have seen that otherwise truthful musical descriptions can fail to 
be informative because the scope of applicability has not be probed.</p>
<p>[63] This paper has presented an analytic method for refining and evaluating feature 
descriptions. The method is inherently comparative&mdash;that is, it clarifies features 
by placing a work in the context of a <i>musical corpus</i> or comparison group. 
The method highlights what makes one work different from another.
<p></p>
<p>[64] The method allows different musical parameters to be integrated within a 
unified feature description. For example, the method allows the analyst to resolve 
whether or not particular articulation marks are integral components of a motive.</p>
<p>[65] In applying the method to Brahms&rsquo;s opus 51, no. 1, the above partial re-analysis 
leads to a number of conclusions: </p>
<p>[66] First, it was found that although Forte&rsquo;s alpha interval-class pattern is 
prevalent (occurs frequently) in opus 51, no. 1, comparison with other string quartet 
movements by Brahms indicated that the pattern is not distinctive. Distinctiveness 
arose only when this pattern was linked to contexts deemed <i>a priori</i> to likely 
increase their salience. This result has a number of repercussions. It suggests 
that the concept of salience is not a mere fiction. It also suggests that our operationally-defined 
estimates of salience (such as phrase onset or outer-voice position) can be useful 
indices of salience. In our analysis, salience was measured in terms of phrase-related 
primacy and recency, rest-induced grouping, unison doubling, outer-voice position, 
and metric position. All of these factors have been shown experimentally to enhance 
the perceptibility of musical events. That is, at least some forms of salience arise 
from known perceptual phenomena. In short, our analysis provides additional evidence 
that perceptual factors can be important in musical analysis.</p>
<p>[67] Second, we showed that it is not the alpha interval-class pattern that 
is the principal feature of this movement, but a particular form of the pattern. 
Although the concept of interval-class identity may be important in certain 
kinds of music, there is little indication in this movement by Brahms that interval-class patterns 
play any significant role.</p>
<p>[68] Third, we showed that the pitch-interval feature was inextricably linked 
to a particular rhythmic context&mdash;namely, long-short-long. Specifically, it was 
demonstrated that this link is bi-directional: the pitch contour is most commonly 
associated with the rhythm, and instances of the rhythm are most commonly associated 
with the pitch contour. In extending set theory to tonal works, theorists ought 
to develop methods for characterizing pitch-rhythm interdependencies.</p>
<p>[69] Finally, it should be noted that the concept of &ldquo;distinctiveness&rdquo; is simply 
an introduction to music analysis of one of the most important concepts in contemporary 
scientific method&mdash;namely the idea of the &ldquo;disproof of the null hypothesis.&rdquo; The 
basic idea is that whenever an observation is made, scholars should endeavor to 
adjudicate its pertinence by asking the question &ldquo;How likely would it be that this 
observation might arise merely by chance?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> In experimental methodology, it is the so-called &ldquo;control group&rdquo; that plays a critical 
role in establishing the likelihood of observing something by chance. In the foregoing 
analysis, we have shown that examining a comparison group (in this case the opening 
movements of Brahms&rsquo;s other two string quartets), permitted us to advance more readily 
in identifying a distinctive feature of opus 51, no. 1.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>

indicate the total number of unique patterns present in the movement. These 
numbers are useful for assessing the relatively importance of the <i>rank 
orderings</i> given for each of the various alpha patterns. For example, the 
10th most common pattern might be relatively important in a work that contains 
100 different patterns; however, the 10th most common pattern might be deemed 
relatively unimportant if the work contains just 15 different patterns. (Being

subsequently reprinted in 1987. &ldquo;Motivic Design and Structural Level in the First 
Movement of Brahms&rsquo;s  String Quartet in C Minor,&rdquo; <i>Musical Quarterly,</i> 69 (1983), 
471&ndash;502. Reprinted in: Michael Musgrave, ed., <i>Brahms 2: Biographical, Documentary 
and Analytic Studies, </i>pp. 165&ndash;196 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987).</div><div id="fndiv2" class="flyoverdiv">Further discussion regarding this point may be found in 
Leonard Meyer, <i>Emotion and Meaning in Music</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago 
Press, 1956).</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">The assumption that lines-of-sound are psychological &ldquo;real&rdquo; 
rather than &ldquo;reified&rdquo; is supported by a wealth of perceptual research. As theorists 
are well aware, not all pitch successions evoke intervals. For an extensive review 
of the pertinent perceptual evidence see Albert Bregman, <i>Auditory Scene Analysis</i> 
(Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1990).</div><div id="fndiv4" class="flyoverdiv">This observation is chronicled in detail in David Huron 
and Jonathon Berec, &ldquo;A Method for Characterizing Instrumental Idiomaticism: A Case 
Study of the B-flat Valve Trumpet.&rdquo; MS.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">See, for example, the discussion of quotation and allusion 
in Kenneth Hull, &ldquo;Brahms the Allusive: Extra-compositional Reference in the Instrumental 
Music of Johannes Brahms,&rdquo; PhD diss., Princeton University, 1989.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">There are other possible definitions of a good description, 
although I am not aware of any in the field of music theory. The definition proposed 
here merely echoes the widespread notion in theory (promoted by Schoenberg) that 
music and musical descriptions ought to seek an economy of expression. It is noteworthy 
that this definition of good description is analogous to the concept of <i>efficiency</i> 
in technical disciplines.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">An introduction to the historical background of this work 
may be found in Michael Musgrave and Robert Pascall, &ldquo;The String Quartets Op. 51 
No. 1 in C minor and No. 2 in A minor: A Preface,&rdquo; in Michael Musgrave, Ed., <i>
Brahms 2: Biographical, Documentary and Analytic Studies</i>, pp. 137&ndash;143 (Cambridge: 
Cambridge University Press, 1987).</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Forte&rsquo;s study focuses predominantly on the musical 
foreground. Similarly, my analytic points will center on foreground features. 
This focus is merely a matter of convenience and of avoiding undue length. As 
the reader will readily understand, the inferential analytical approach employed 
here is as pertinent to the comparative evaluation of proposed background, 
middleground, and process-related features as it is to foreground motivic 
features.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">All of the ensuing measurements were carried out using 
the Humdrum Toolkit software. All repeats were expanded in the electronic scores 
prior to processing. See David Huron, <i>Unix Software Tools for Music Research; 
The Humdrum Toolkit Reference Manual</i> (Menlo Park, CA: Center for Computer Assisted 
Research in the Humanities, 1995). Extensive online information is available regarding
<a HREF='http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/index.html'>Humdrum</a>, including an online introductory <a HREF='http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Humdrum/guide.toc.html'>User Guide</a>.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">A ludicrous comparison to be sure, but one that well illustrates the point.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">For pertinent experimental evidence see David Huron, &ldquo;Voice Denumerability in Polyphonic Music of Homogeneous Timbres,&rdquo; <i>Music Perception </i>6 (1989), 361&ndash;382. (An <a HREF='http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.denumerability.abstract.html'>abstract</a> is available online.) For a demonstration of this perceptual phenomenon  affecting musical organization see David Huron and Deborah Fantini, &ldquo;The Avoidance 
of Inner-voice Entries: Perceptual Evidence and Musical Practice,&rdquo; <i>Music Perception </i>7 (1989), 43&ndash;47. The <a HREF='http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.inner.text.html'>complete text</a> is available online.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">The numbers on this line 
indicate the total number of unique patterns present in the movement. These 
numbers are useful for assessing the relatively importance of the <i>rank 
orderings</i> given for each of the various alpha patterns. For example, the 
10th most common pattern might be relatively important in a work that contains 
100 different patterns; however, the 10th most common pattern might be deemed 
relatively unimportant if the work contains just 15 different patterns. (Being 
the 5th best student in one&rsquo;s class is more significant in a class of 80 
students than in a class of 10 students.)</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">The term &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is used here in the formal statistical 
sense of the word. Pooling the data for the two control movements, a chi-square 
analysis for the ratios of expected to actual instances produces the following results: 
prime form of alpha (<i>X2</i>=56.47; df=1; p&lt;&lt;0.001 significant); inverted 
form (<i>X2</i>=1.82; df=1; p=0.18, not significant); retrograde form 
(<i>X2</i>=53.39; df=1; p&lt;&lt;0.001, significant absence); retrograde inverted 
form (<i>X2</i>=5.22; p=0.02, significant absence).</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Forte&rsquo;s  motivic description would appear to have only 
one advantage over the feature developed in this paper and shown in Example 3: namely, 
the alpha motive is more succinct. However, since the alpha interval-class motive 
is not distinctive of the work in question, the feature description must be regarded 
as too brief.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Readers familiar with Forte&rsquo;s  paper may have noted that 
our analysis has focused exclusively on Forte&rsquo;s  alpha motives without mentioning 
the innumerable other subsidiary patterns discussed in his analysis. The reason 
should now be clear. Many of Forte&rsquo;s  other motivic sets suffer from the same problems, 
and other sets appear to be attempts to patch up the shortcomings of the alpha 
pattern.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">A number of articles have applied this principle to the 
study of music, including much of the current author&rsquo;s  published research. A useful description of the research approach may be found in the second chapter of Zohar Eitan, <i>Highpoints: A Study of Melodic Peaks</i> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997)&mdash;although see comments in the current author&rsquo;s  <a HREF='http://dactyl.som.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Publications/huron.Eitan.review.html'>book review</a> (<i>Music Perception</i>, 16 [1999], 257&ndash;264).</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">This research was completed in 1994 while the author was a visiting scholar at the <a HREF='http://www.ccarh.org/'>Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities</a>, Stanford University.
