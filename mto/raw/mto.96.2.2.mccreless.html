<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] What best captures the spirit in which the following collection of
essays was conceived is the little connective in the title:
&ldquo;Contemporary Music Theory <i>and</i> the New Musicology.&rdquo;  Not, mind you,
&ldquo;Contemporary Music Theory <i>or</i> the New Musicology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Contemporary
Music Theory <i>versus</i> the New Musicology,&rdquo; &ldquo;Contemporary Music Theory
<i>in spite of</i> the New Musicology,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Contemporary Music Theory
<i>instead</i> of the New Musicology,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Contemporary Music Theory <i>and</i>
the New Musicology.&rdquo;  Not that we should deny the reality of the
tensions that characterize our current situation and engage in a game
of denial&mdash;a game, as our therapists tell us, that our whole family
can enjoy for now, but that will bring us all to ruin in the end.  For
it is no news that music theory, and especially theory-based analysis,
has often not fared well under the critical eye of many new
musicologists.  Nor is it news that such critiques have engendered
among theorists a wide variety of responses&mdash;from outright horror to
mere bemusement, from outraged cries for primitive justice (a
Schenkerian tooth for a Foucauldian eye), to a reexamination of our
fundamental principles, to, in a few cases, outright spiritual
conversion.  And, of course, it comes as no news to any of us that if
the new musicology had come to praise music theory and celebrate its
intellectual triumphs, the new musicology would not be what it is
today, and we would all have something better to do than ponder the
curious relationship between contemporary music theory <i>and</i> the new
musicology.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p>

[2] It is this last point&mdash;that the new, &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; musicology
carved out space for itself, if not at the expense of music theory, at
least in the context of music theory&mdash;that can offer us some insight
into that relationship.  For to conceptualize the matter in this way
is to conceptualize it in terms of disciplinarity, and if these essays
are about anything, they are about disciplines: how and against what
models they define themselves, how they create themselves as ways of
thinking and bodies of knowledge, and especially how their knowledge
colludes with their power.  Or, as Michel Foucault put it, &ldquo;There is
no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of
knowledge, nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute
at the same time power relations.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> It is easy enough to read the
relationship of contemporary music theory and the new musicology in
Foucault&rsquo;s terms.<p>

[3] Consider the birth of contemporary music theory, which, I shall
argue, defined itself in two critical historical moments in the past
few decades.  In each of these moments, music theory&mdash;and here I mean
the modern, and indeed distinctly American version of music
theory&mdash;defined itself against what it perceived to be a repressive
regime from which it sought liberation.  Its first defining moment was
the late 1950&rsquo;s and early 1960&rsquo;s, a time aptly described by Milton
Babbitt in a reminiscence in his <i>Words About Music</i>:<p>

<blockquote>
   I really think of our professional theorists beginning 
   with the generation of Allen Forte [that is, in the 
   1950&rsquo;s].  The notion of professional theory is almost 
   totally new.  There were virtually no professional theorists 
   in this country [at that time].  There was no such thing as 
   a professional theorist at any university that I can
   think of when I began becoming involved with universities.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p>
</blockquote>

<p>What there was, instead of the professional <i>theorist</i>, was the <i>music
theory teacher</i>, a pedagogue who represented whatever remnants of the
great European theoretical tradition that had survived the trip across
the Atlantic.  And what the new theorists of the first generation of
the modern discipline aspired to was the continuation and
revitalization of that tradition.  They thus rejected, and defined
themselves against, the &ldquo;mere&rdquo; theory pedagogue.<p>

[4] This theme is a constant refrain in the early issues of the
<i>Journal of Music Theory</i>, which was founded in 1957.  For example, on
the first page of the first issue of the first volume of the journal,
we read the following in the opening essay by the Yale theorist David
Kraehenbuehl:<p>

<blockquote>
   In centuries past the formulation of laws regarding the 
   practice of music was regarded as the highest aim for a
   musician; and, in many instances, musical laws were the 
   inspiration or the source for more general laws regarding 
   material or spiritual experience.  Music was the image of 
   the universe, hence, a source of truth; and it was the 
   music theorist who sought, discovered, and expressed both 
   natural and divine law.  But in our own time it is the rare 
   musician who knows how his art offers a key to universal 
   understanding.  Music theory has become a discipline in 
   stylistic definition or, still less, a system of nomenclature 
   and classification that offers no valid laws even regarding 
   music.  It is to the restoration of music theory as more than 
   a didactic convenience, more than a necessary discipline, as, 
   in fact, a mode of creative thought that this journal is
   dedicated.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup><p>
</blockquote>

<p>[5] And so, contemporary music theory was born when Babbitt at
Princeton, Forte at Yale, and others elsewhere began to treat music
theory as a legitimate academic discipline rather than as a service
discipline for conservatories and university music schools.  It was a
discipline that hitched the rigors of twelve-tone and a soon to evolve
pitch-class-set theory to the artistic and intellectual force, as well
as the European pedigree, of Schenker, in what William Benjamin has
aptly called a &ldquo;marriage of convenience&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>, in order to stake a
claim for admission to the modern academy, and especially to the
modern research university.  Contemporary music theory, throwing off
the shackles of its old pedagogical self, opened up for itself a
disciplinary space that was at one and the same time a new knowledge
and a formidable appropriation of power.  Out of the music theory
teacher was thus born the music theorist.<p>

[6] The second defining moment in the history of contemporary music
theory was 1977, the year of the founding of the Society for Music
Theory.  Here there were two established disciplines against which the
new American music theory reacted: composition, to which theory had
long been subordinated in the job market and academic power structure;
and, more importantly, musicology.  For it was by splitting off from
the American Society for University Composers, and more particularly
from the American Musicological Society, in a move that still at times
reverberates through the crowded halls of joint AMS/SMT meetings, that
the Society for Music Theory created a place for itself.  And what
music theory at that time&mdash;in the late 1970&rsquo;s&mdash;most emphatically was
not, was what it perceived musicology as being: manuscript study,
watermarks, composer biography, ever more detailed studies of ever
more obscure composers, description rather than analysis, the study of
genre, and worst of all, the study of style and stylistic change.
What <i>we</i>, as theorists understood that the musicologists reputedly
did not was <i>music</i>&mdash;dare I say, music itself: the score, the sound,
the structure, the work, and how &ldquo;it&rdquo; &ldquo;works&rdquo;.<p>

[7] Having in these two defining moments constituted itself as a
discipline, what has contemporary music theory accomplished?  Now what
Foucault teaches us about disciplines is that, if they are in some
respects repressive&mdash;the disciplines that he chose to study (the
hospital, the asylum, the barracks, the prison) certainly were&mdash;they
are also <i>productive</i>.  Whatever else they do, they produce, or
better: they enable production.  Or better still, knowledge and power
pull each other up by the bootstraps to produce more knowledge, which
lays further claim to power.  Contemporary music theory&rsquo;s new
knowledge (its use of original or revitalized systems of analysis to
explicate the individual work) secured its admission to the
university.  But admission to the university meant that it had to
submit itself to the well-known academic machinery that forced it to
produce.  And produce it did: new theories, countless analyses,
essays, books, new journals, conferences, conference papers&mdash;in a
word, a &ldquo;product,&rdquo; a new knowledge, a veritable industry, one that has
been successfully exportable back across the Atlantic, where
contemporary American theory serves as a model for theoretical and
analytical journals in Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and
beyond.  Yet music theory&rsquo;s knowledge is inseparable from its power,
for just as academic jobs in the discipline require the creation of
new research and new knowledge, so does that new knowledge create more
jobs, more representation in music curricula, more graduate programs,
and so forth.  Contemporary music theory, with its concern for rigor,
for analysis, for structure, for the work, has thus produced a way of
knowing, a knowledge, along with a disciplinary structure to support
that knowledge.  And ultimately, what it has produced is <i>us</i>, today&rsquo;s
&ldquo;music theorists&rdquo;; or, more appropriately, it is that which has
enabled us to produce ourselves.<p>

[8] Strange, then, that it was music theory&rsquo;s tying itself so doggedly
to the notions of structure, of system, of work, that in time
inadvertently opened up a disciplinary space for the new, postmodern
musicology, thus providing the latter with a foil against which <i>it</i>
could constitute<i> itself</i> as a new knowledge, a new power.  Of course,
the other foil for the new musicology was the &ldquo;old&rdquo; musicology, a
musicology that still focused on the work and on the canon, and that
was less inclined to question the ideology and politics on which both
the canon and musicology itself were based.  Watching the new
musicology produce and appropriate its own brand of power, we look on
and wonder if it is doing to us what we did to composers and
musicologists of a generation ago.<p>

[9] And so, here in the mid-1990&rsquo;s, where do we, as a discipline, and
as individual theorists, stand, when we view what we historically have
produced, and what the new musicology now produces, whether in disdain
or ignorance of us, or in gleeful contradistinction to us.  We as
theorists locate ourselves along a wide spectrum of points of view.
Some of us are formalists or &ldquo;modernists&rdquo; and proud of it&mdash;I heard
Milton Babbitt, prescient as always, proclaim in a 1982 lecture that
he was an unredeemed logical positivist, long before it occurred to
many of us that there was anything to be redeemed from.  At the other
end of the spectrum are those who question the fundamental premises of
contemporary music theory to the extent that they no longer wish to be
called &ldquo;music theorists,&rdquo; a label that brands them as direct
descendants of that creature that was born with such fanfare in 1957.
As we examine where we fall along this spectrum, we should keep in
mind the wise words of the cultural historian David Couzens Hoy:<p>

<blockquote>
   Historical breaks do not occur everywhere for everyone at the 
   same time. The same person, discipline, or institution can be 
   traditional in some respects, modern in others, and postmodern 
   in yet others.  Furthermore, since [in the eyes of the 
   postmodern] there is no necessary progress, no forward movement 
   in history, and perhaps no such thing as history (in the
   absence of a convincing metanarrative), the postmodern cannot 
   imply that there is any normative advantage that comes from 
   either being later in time or a sign of the future.  Postmodernism 
   cannot and should not claim to be better, more advanced, or more 
   clever than whatever preceded it.  That modernism does assume this 
   superiority is what distinguishes it from postmodernism, and what 
   postmodern pastiche disruptively reveals.  So a postmodern cannot 
   argue that those who are traditional or modern must eventually

</blockquote>

<p>[10] And so I urge readers of the essays that follow, whether
theorists or musicologists, analysts or critics, moderns or
postmoderns, or those who are sufficiently evolved to label themselves
as nothing whatsoever, to return to the little connective that links

intriguing disciplinary spaces that separate us and that bring us
together.</p>
