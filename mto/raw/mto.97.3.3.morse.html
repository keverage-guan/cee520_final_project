<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>Dear Professor Killam,
<p>

[1] I will attempt here to reply to your <i>MTO</i> 3.2 article, &ldquo;Cognitive
Dissonance: Should Twentieth-century Women Composers be Grouped with
Foucault&rsquo;s Mad Criminals?,&rdquo; in the form of an open letter to you.  The
reply takes this form in part due to the nature of your argument, and
in part to my responses to it.  I cannot find another way to reply than
personally, since finally that&rsquo;s all my reaction to your piece can
be.  I have racked my brains trying to find some common ground for
conversation with you (and the list) about what you raise.  I cannot
find it in what you write.  Rather than condemn your effort out of
hand, however, or escalate the anger which so plainly inspired the
piece, I want to try to talk&mdash;again, <i>with</i> you, not at you, in so far
as I can&mdash;about your argument and its effects (on me, at least).
<p>

[2] Let me say at once that I was neither outraged nor shocked by what
you wrote, but only saddened.  Furthermore, given this reaction, I must
admit that, despite considerable effort on my part&mdash;as well as on
yours&mdash;I learned nothing from what you said.  You offer a very familiar
argument.  The notion that anthologies without woman speakers represent
not oversight or rational choice but all-but-conscious bad faith by
the (male) anthologist is by now commonplace.  So, too, is the
rhetorical tactic of reading unspoken (and projected) intentions in
anthology choices.  Finally, the use of scholarly discourse for
&ldquo;political&rdquo; provocation is near to a hallmark of our age.
<p>

[3] Although such gestures may still have the capacity to annoy or
wound their readers&rsquo; sensibilities, they have lost the element of
surprise.  There is a difference between the shock of an utterly
unconsidered idea and the weariness of all-too-familiar harassment.  
The real indictment of rhetorical provocation is not that it is 
annoying or offensive, but that it does not work.  Even at a
<i>second</i> attempt, the intended provokee will simply opt out of the 
familiar shock experience.
<p>

[4] As a model of learning experience, shock suffers the limit of
working only once.  Even that first effect is not guaranteed.  The
rhetoric of deliberate shock puts an impossible responsibility on the
reader, i.e., to <i>be</i> provoked.  This is a reaction initially beyond our
control, but subsequently entirely with<i>in</i> it.  In reading your
article, I not only did not choose to be outraged, I simply could not
be; those sensations have been numbed by overstimulation from other
sources.  In attempting to force readers into a sensitivity they are
absolutely presumed to lack, the achieved reaction can be just the
opposite.  Give a reader or listener no room for creative response, and
the result, sooner or later, is some form of desensitization.
<p>

[5] I have spoken thus far as if it were incontrovertible that your
aims were provocation and shock.  Among other things, your surprise
at the lack of reaction to your piece on mto-talk speaks to this
contention.  More importantly, does your essay even allow for another
kind of reaction?  You can hardly have expected a measured,
pipe-smoking discussion of your claims when their manifest aim is
forcible consciousness-raising.  The form and substance of your essay
catch your reader in an inescapable vise.  You discuss the intentions
of four anthologists, reading them such that only <i>one</i> interpretation
is possible (the three apparent variants you offer will be discussed
presently).  To address motive and inspiration is to leave argument qua
argument to one side&mdash;the more so since your hapless anthologists&rsquo;
alleged intentions are in their turn used as a symptom of a &ldquo;cultural
climate.&rdquo;  This interpretation is then offered in a way which further
interprets the reader&rsquo;s intentions in advance.  I mean simply this: you
do not <i>allow</i> for a reader who reads your paper and reacts to it
with unconviction:  &ldquo;Yes, I have read your arguments and understood
them, but I disagree.  I am not convinced that these anthologists have
wilfully neglected woman composers.&rdquo;  In your discourse, there is no such
thing as anthological inadvertence, no room for the conviction that
gender is anything less than a crucial determinant of musical
experience.
<p>

[6] Instead of arguing <i>for</i> the thesis that gender is a decisive
dimension for musical analysis, you denounce those who fail to act
in accord with this view.  The three &ldquo;hypotheses&rdquo; for the absence of
female composers become three &ldquo;causes.&rdquo;  What begins as the &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo;
of women composers in your first paragraph is called &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo; in
paragraph 9, but has become &ldquo;the possible <i>causes</i> of [the] <i>omission</i>&rdquo;
in paragraph 11.  By paragraph 12, &ldquo;contemporary theorists&rsquo; <i>need</i>
to ignore works by women composers.&rdquo;  Paragraph 15 speaks of their
&ldquo;<i>erasure</i> from our analytical literature,&rdquo; and 16 asks &ldquo;What better
cultural <i>punishment</i><nobr>. . .</nobr>can be <i>devised</i> (however unintentional) for
women composers, than to ignore their work in the books which the
theoretical community designates as central to learning twentieth-century compositional and theoretical techniques?&rdquo;  The highlighted
terms show how the rhetoric becomes drastically more transitive as the 
essay proceeds.  The decision which even the anthologists themselves 
see as an oversight has become direct and active complicity in 
oppression.  Without <i>direct</i> argument, the necessarily limited act
of selection has taken on the character of violent and indubitable
suppression.
<p>

[7] This tactic saddens me for several reasons.  Quite apart from any
grammatical nuances here, I do not believe that &ldquo;not including&rdquo;
someone or something is intrinsically the same as &ldquo;excluding&rdquo; them, let
alone for the horrendous reasons you suggest, such as deliberate
silencing and punishment.  The gap between &ldquo;non-inclusion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; may be fine, but to traverse it successfully takes a
careful, substantial, and specific argument.  To suggest that because
the &ldquo;culture&rdquo; as an abstract whole silences women, then these
anthologists do, too, is to confuse Straus and Kostka with Hefner and
North. (Even among males, there are significant nuances of attitude.)
<p>

[8] The choice of attacking analysis anthologists for their non-recognition of woman composers still begs the larger question of
<i>what</i> it is that anthologists should recognize.  As I understand it,
your complaint is not simply that women deserve equal representation
in analysis anthologies on general principles of fairness, but because
their music presents specifically, even uniquely female dimensions of
musical experience.  Are there, however, any even faintly satisfactory
criteria for woman&rsquo;s musical procedures in particular?  I realize that
some attempts have been made, especially by Susan McClary, but even
she spends the bulk of her time in denouncing the signs of patriarchal
oversight.  I&rsquo;m not arguing that analysis or music are immune to
politics, or to class, or to gender, but posing the question which
I&rsquo;ve grown weary of seeing left in abeyance:  if music analysis is a
specific, coherent procedure, what contributions to it does the factor
of composer gender offer?  And how will analysis enrich and be enriched
by such understanding?  Again, I can see that there may be some perceived
political or moral benefit in creating more &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; anthologies,
but what <i>specifically</i> analytic benefits accrue from such a choice?
<p>

[9] Instead of posing a largely empty rhetorical question such as  
<p>
<blockquote>
Could exemplifying analysis through compositions by women, 
who are defined by our culture to embody illogic, constitute 
an implicitly inappropriate pedagogical approach? [20],
</blockquote>
<p>

it is time to establish exactly what can be accomplished by accepting
gender as a genuinely ontological criterion for music.  It has not
proven easy to do this for (arguably similar) criteria such as
nationality and ethnicity, but such efforts have not gone entirely
unrewarded, either.  The record for some other politically-born
criteria have been less promising.  To me at least, the attempts of
proto-soviet musicologists to adumbrate social class as an
<i>independent</i> element of musical expression have been a resounding
flop, save at a level of futile indirection:  it <i>audibly</i> costs a lot
more to build and maintain a culture which bears <i>Don Giovanni</i> or
Peking Opera than it does unaccompanied field hollers or pan pipes.
However, that still doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the music beyond its 
cost.
<p>

[10] I do not believe that an argument of this kind helps to establish
or clarify the nature of women&rsquo;s music, nor the role of women
composers in musical analysis.  Instead, and despite your explicit
repudiation of &ldquo;binary oppositions&rdquo; and simplistic arguments, all
roads here lead to ever more abrupt contradistinction between the
genders.  There is a recognizable place for me in your article, and I
see it all too clearly: I am &ldquo;a&rdquo; male.  While I take no offense at the
noun, the article bothers me tremendously, because you make no case
for it.  I can no more see myself as &ldquo;a&rdquo; man than I can see Ruth
Crawford Seeger as &ldquo;a&rdquo; woman composer.  It is not one&rsquo;s sacrosanct
individuality which is undermined by this gesture but, on the
contrary, the principle of identity itself.  Foundationalism or no,
essentialism or no, &ldquo;a&rdquo; category must have &ldquo;a&rdquo; basis of some
kind.  There must be some tangible principle for understanding what a
term brings together and unites.  Quite simply, what do we gain, <i>how</i>
does it help us to see each of Seeger, Beach, Schumann, Bley, and Joni
Mitchell as &ldquo;a&rdquo; woman composer?  Attacking anthologists for their
failure to follow this principle before any real efforts have been
made to establish it seems unfair in the extreme.
<p>

[11] That is why I have composed this reply as an open
letter.  Although without anger, I took what you said personally in
several senses.  You present a version of scholarly conversation which
is deeply troublesome to me since it sets so little store by fairness
and openness, and so much on its own rhetorical privilege.  Despite the
richly woven fabric of plausible deniability, I hardly think that it&rsquo;s
my own paranoia to claim that this article cannot help but address men
and women in a forcibly different sense.  And, despite the appalling
history of men addressing women in terms of similar or even worse
condescension, the homily that two wrongs do not make a right applies
here.  Like all too many now, your cure for the injustices of gendered
language seems to be homeopathic.  Finally, your assurances that the
coming generations vastly outdo you in radicalism is depressing beyond
words.  I can only assume that means even more effort will be expended
in denouncing those who do not believe in what has yet to be
explained, more preemptive strikes and shock and terror in place of
argument and discussion.  If that happens, then it will be a sense of
music of both women and men which is sacrificed on the altar of
political intransigence.</p>
