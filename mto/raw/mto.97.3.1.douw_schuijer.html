<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The year 1994 saw the merger of two Dutch
conservatories: the Sweelinck Conservatory of
Amsterdam and the Hilversum Conservatory of Music. The
Sweelinck Conservatory was an independent institute,
itself the product of a merger of three schools of
music in 1976. It was a large, traditional
conservatory that was strongly committed to the great
canon of western art music. It had an excellent
reputation in the field of historical performance, due
to the achievements of such celebrities as Gustav
Leonhard, Jaap Schroeder and Ton Koopman, all of whom
occupied teaching positions at the Sweelinck. The
Hilversum Conservatory of Music, situated in a small
town about 18 miles away from the city of Amsterdam,
functioned as a department of the Amsterdam School of
the Arts since 1988. Besides educational and
performance degrees in classical and early music, it
also offered degrees in jazz, including a master&rsquo;s
degree (MA) jointly with the University of Miami.
Hilversum&rsquo;s pioneering role in raising the status of
jazz in Holland can hardly be overestimated.
Its jazz program provided a standard for similar
programs at other Dutch conservatories, for example
the Royal Conservatory of The Hague.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p>

[2] Increasing financial pressures forced the
Sweelinck Conservatory to become part of the Amsterdam
School of the Arts and, consequently, to join forces
with Hilversum. Hilversum&rsquo;s administration, in turn,
had every reason to jump at the proposal. It had
always been in a rather vulnerable position, since it
belonged to the smaller of the 12 state-aided
conservatories in Holland. Though already part of a
larger unit, it could still be dropped on account of
low enrollment figures. Besides, the Dutch Department
of Education was preparing a nation-wide reform of the
conservatory programs. This would shorten the
duration of these programs from five to four years,
and enable only the largest and best-equipped
conservatories to provide education on an advanced
level for two additional years. It was quite clear
that this governmental policy aimed at a cutback in
expenditure, and that small conservatories like
Hilversum&rsquo;s would eventually fall victim to it. So,
the Sweelinck and Hilversum Conservatories both had an
interest in merging. The result of their amalgamation
was the Amsterdam School of Music.
<p>

[3] Naturally, making two teaching institutes into one
is no easy operation. It involves, among 
many other things, cutting down on trusted
staff, revising well-tried curricula, and adjusting
long-accepted admission and degree requirements. And
when the individuals of these institutes are as
different as those at the former Sweelinck and
Hilversum Conservatories, it puts a severe strain on
the acceptance and creativity of the faculties
involved. On the other hand, it may also provide an
opportunity to consider whether a particular program
still serves its implicit goals and meets the
requirements of the professional field.
<p>

[4] The classical music departments of the Sweelinck
and Hilversum Conservatories offered music theory
curricula that were so widely divergent that the
creation of an entirely new curriculum for the
Amsterdam School of Music, to which both theory
divisions would agree, was necessary. Apart from
bringing about an agreement, however, this new
curriculum also needed to safeguard the continuation
of music theory teaching on the same level as before
under the more restrictive conditions imposed by the
Department of Education. Furthermore, it needed to
respond to the current differentiation of musical
life, and to the specialization of musical knowledge
going hand in hand with it.
<p>

[5] At the Sweelinck Conservatory every student
enrolled had to complete a two-year music theory
program. Apart from a short introductory course on the
fundamentals of music, this program consisted of a
course combining harmony and analysis, and one
combining solfege and ear-training. Both courses
extended over the full range of two years. There were
also courses on modal and tonal counterpoint, but
these were mandatory for special categories of
students only: students of organ, composition and
music theory. The modal counterpoint course was also
intended for students of early music.
<p>

[6] The harmony and analysis course offered at the
Sweelinck Conservatory was basically a harmony course
occasionaly touching on music analysis. Students were
not trained in examining scores and writing analytical
papers, but rather learned to respond verbally to what
they heard in a musical piece. While music analysis
was given only slight consideration, harmony was
taught intensively. The entire range of the
discipline, from the fundamental materials to
chromaticism, was covered in the first year. The
second year was devoted to writing exercises in
various tonal forms and styles, for example Lieder,
preludes, fugues and sonata expositions. Thus,
students were made familiar with harmonic principles
as embodied in musical compositions.
<p>

[7] At the Hilversum Conservatory of Music every
student enrolled followed a three-year music
theory program, the core of which was a course,
extending over the whole study period, which combined
harmony, analysis and ear-training. Solfege was taught
seperately, while counterpoint courses were required
for only a few majors, as at the Sweelinck
Conservatory. This lengthy and highly integrated
program was adopted from the Royal Conservatory in
The Hague, which counted several former music theory
students on Hilversum&rsquo;s faculty. Contrary to the
Sweelinck Conservatory&rsquo;s program it centered around
music analysis. Hilversum students received a more
scholarly training than their colleagues at the
Sweelinck, a training that involved writing analytical
papers, and that was expected to deepen their musical
experience. Extra-curricular events added to this
scholarly training. Several lecture series and
seminars have been organized in Hilversum, some of
which have explored specific areas of music theory. In
1989, for example, there was a four-day seminar on the
theories of Heinrich Schenker.
<p>

[8] The theory curriculum offered by the classical
music department of the new Amsterdam School of Music,
which has been drawn up by the music theorist Henk
Borgdorff, is much more flexible than the curricula of
the former Sweelinck and Hilversum Conservatories.
Further, it allows more interaction with the music
history program. From the second year onward students
are offered elective theory and history courses, so
that they can compile a program that suits their
major, or that simply meets their special interests.
The comprehensive approach that was characteristic for
Hilversum&rsquo;s program in particular has been dispensed
with, since it tended to invite a certain shallowness
and rigidity in the last few years. The elective system
replacing it offers sufficient time for thorough
instruction, and sufficient scope for integrating new
fields of study.
<p>

[9] The curriculum is organized as follows. The 34
weeks of the academic year are divided into three
trimesters of ten weeks each, plus two periods of two
weeks between the trimesters in which students take
exams or participate in orchestral projects. Everyone
is required to follow weekly lessons in harmony and
ear-training and solfege throughout their first two
years. In the first year, an introductory course in
18th-century analysis is a requirement for all
students. In addition, they follow two trimesters of
20th-century analysis. In the second year, they are
required to follow one trimester of early music
analysis, two trimesters of 18th- and 19th-century
analysis, two trimesters of twentieth-century
analysis, as well as an instrumentation course of two
trimesters.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[10] Starting in their second year, students make a
choice of specialized courses in both theory and
history. Those who want do develop their writing
skills may choose to do Renaissance counterpoint,
Baroque counterpoint, melody in early music, and/or
advanced instrumentation. A course in 20th-century
solfege and ear-training is offered to those
interested in contemporary music. Furthermore, a rich
variety of analysis and history courses is offered,
all taking up one trimester of ten two-hour lessons.
Some of the courses focus on one, two or three
composers while others will study single compositions,
composition cycles or the music of a larger period. A
similar albeit smaller choice of history courses is
offered (see Table 1).

[11] An identical number of courses is not required of
all students. A &lsquo;standard&rsquo; program is followed by
students of early music, piano, college music, and
conductors of brass bands. An &lsquo;extended&rsquo; program is
followed by students of composition, organ, church
music, and music theory. However, most of the students
follow a &lsquo;limited&rsquo; program. This program is followed
by students of the regular instruments as well as
those of voice and opera and those of orchestral and
choral conducting. On the other hand, some of the
courses are compulsory for certain majors. For
example, singers follow extra solfege courses and
students of orchestral and choral conducting are
required to follow specialized analysis courses. On
average, a student will choose one course from each of
the categories A, B and C in <b>Table 1</b>, and five courses
irrespective of the categories to which they belong.
<p>

[12] So far, the response of both students and staff
to the new curriculum is quite positive. In the one-plus year of its use only two minor disadvantages have
emerged. The administrative complications are more
elaborate now than they used to be. The expectation is
that this problem will be solved in due course.
Another disadvantage is that the second trimester
takes place from November through March which means
that it is interrupted by the Christmas holidays. This
interruption tends to break the attention span.
However, the general opinion is that the advantages
outweigh the problems. Teachers give classes within
their fields of specializiation and, similarly, their
courses are attended by highly motivated students!</p>
