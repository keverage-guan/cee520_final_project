<p style="text-align: center"><b>1. Introduction: Western and African Concepts of Meter</b></p>

<p>[1.1]  Gyorgy Ligeti&rsquo;s ongoing series of piano etudes embodies many
elements of his music since 1980&mdash;a fascination with complex rhythms,
a pursuit of new kinds of harmonies and melodies, and a strange,
almost eerie reminiscence of earlier styles of music. The first book
of etudes, numbers one through six, appeared in 1985; he completed the
second book of eight in 1993; one more, the beginning of book three,
has appeared since then. While all the etudes are innovative, one of
the most striking is number six, &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie.&rdquo; One of Ligeti&rsquo;s
main goals in this piece is to produce exceedingly complex polyrhythms
with a single, human interpreter.<p>


[1.2]  He produces these polyrhythms by combining two vastly different
sources of inspiration: the Romantic-era piano music of Chopin and
Schumann, and the indigenous music of sub-Saharan Africa. The composer
writes:
<p>

<blockquote>
One often arrives at something qualitatively new by unifying two
already known but separate domains. In this case, I have combined two
distinct musical ideas: the hemiola of Schumann and Chopin, which
depends on meter, and the additive pulsation principle of African
music<nobr>. . .</nobr> [T]he hemiola arises from the metric ambiguity posed by a
measure of six beats, which can either be divided in three groups of
two or in two groups of three<nobr>. . .</nobr> The shimmering effect of dividing
the bar simultaneously into two and three produces the metric tension
which is one of the most seductive attractions of the music of Chopin,
Schumann, Brahms, and Liszt.<p>
 
A completely different metric ambiguity occurs in African music. Here
there are no measures in the European sense, but instead two rhythmic
levels: a ground layer of fast, even pulsations which are not counted
as such but rather felt, and a superimposed, upper layer of
occasionally symmetrical, but more often asymmetrical, patterns of
varying length.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>2. Chopin, Hofstadter and Hemiola</b></p>

<p>[2.1]  Ligeti may have drawn inspiration regarding the European hemiola
from the philosopher and scientist Douglas R. Hofstadter, whom Ligeti
often cites as a literary influence. Hofstadter offers some intriguing
notions in his article, &ldquo;Pattern, Poetry, and Power in the Music of
Frederic Chopin:&rdquo;
<p>

<blockquote>
In theory, two voices playing a three-against-two pattern need not be
perfectly aligned. If you shift the upper voice by, say, 1/12 to the
right, you get a different picture [Example 1]. Here the triplet&rsquo;s
third note starts halfway through the doublet&rsquo;s second. As you can
see, the triplet extends beyond the end of the interval, presumably to
join onto another identical pattern. We can fold the pattern around
and represent its periodicity in a circle, as is shown [also in
Example 1].  By rotating either of the concentric 
circles like a knob,
we get all possible ways of hearing three beats against two. In Chopin
and most other Western music, though, the only possibility that I have
seen explored is where the triplet and doublet are perfectly &ldquo;in
phase.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></blockquote>

[2.2]  As shown in <b>Example 1</b>, Hofstadter constructs a grid of twelve
pulses underneath the three-against-two pattern, in a way that
remarkably resembles what Ligeti will do in his sixth etude. Also, by
suggesting that hemiolas need not be &ldquo;in phase,&rdquo; Hofstadter stretches
the idea in a way that suggests Ligeti&rsquo;s own complex hemiolas. The
idea of phasing, of course, also recalls Steve Reich&rsquo;s music, as well
as earlier works by Ligeti&mdash;especially &ldquo;Selbstportrait mit Reich und
Riley (<i>und Chopin ist auch dabei</i>)&rdquo; from the <i>Three Pieces for Two
Pianos</i>.
<p>

[2.3]  A few pages later, Hofstadter describes what he calls &ldquo;a tricky
bit of polyrhythm&rdquo;&mdash;actually a complex combination of 2:3 and 3:8 from Chopin&rsquo;s Fourth Ballade (measures 175&ndash;76). This complex hemiola is perhaps the closest precursor to the rhythms of &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie&rdquo; in the piano repertoire.<p>

<p>

[2.4]  At a fast tempo, the polyrhythm does not really sound like a
complex hemiola, but creates an &ldquo;illusory&rdquo; effect of rubato. Ligeti
utilizes this quasi-rubato in his sixth etude by altering the European
hemiola to combine several groups of beats: instead of two against
three, he uses such combinations as 3:5, 5:7, or even 3:4:5:7. At the
same time, he does away with European meter&mdash;the larger grouping of
beats into measures&mdash;by replacing meter with a continuous,
undifferentiated pulse of sixteenth notes. This quick, steady pulse
stems from an African concept of rhythm, explained by Israeli
ethnomusicologist Simha Arom.<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>3. Ligeti, Simha Arom, and African Rhythm</b></p>

<p>
[3.1]  Ligeti wrote an introduction for Arom&rsquo;s 
book, <i>Polyphonies et
polyrhythmies instrumentales d&rsquo;Afrique centrale</i>,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> in which he
focused on the music&rsquo;s possibilities for modern composition:<p>

<blockquote>
<nobr>. . .</nobr>[Arom&rsquo;s research] opens the door leading to a new way of thinking
about polyphony, one which is completely different from the European
metric structures, but equally rich, or maybe, considering the
possibility of using a quick pulse as a &ldquo;common denominator&rdquo; upon
which various patterns can be polyrhythmically superimposed, even
richer than the European tradition (page xviii).
</blockquote>
<p>

[3.2]  According to Arom, African music (specifically, the music of the
sub-Saharan Pygmy peoples) does not rely on the Western concept of
meter. Classical European meter, he says, is nothing more nor less
than a series of identical durations with regular accentuation&mdash;in
other words, meter is a simple rhythm, spread out on a large
scale. African rhythms are cyclical and repeating, but their lack of
bar accentuation, as well as their speed and complexity, distinguish
them from European rhythms and meters.<p>

[3.3]   For Ligeti, the absence of meter is 
nothing new. Typically,
barlines in his music have functioned only as optical aids for the
performers. In &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; the same holds true: the listener
perceives only chains of complex hemiolas, moving independently of any
barlines. This metric freedom recalls not only African music, but
Medieval and Renaissance music as well, and probably underlies
Ligeti&rsquo;s admiration for masters such as Ockeghem and Phillipe de
Vitry, as well as the ars subtilior of the late fourteenth century.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b>. Freely adapted from Arom, <i>African Polyphony and Polyrhythm</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="taylor_examples.php?id=2&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 3 thumbnail" src="taylor_ex3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>[3.4]  Even though African rhythms do not rely on meter, they do
resemble hemiolas, with different layers of accents occurring
simultaneously. But only rarely do these accents fall into the
European two-against-three grouping. More often they tend toward
twelve beats, divided into three-against-four: one level of complexity
higher, as it were, than their European counterparts.<p>

<p>

Twelve-beat groups divided into three-against-four patterns and
polymeters have occupied Ligeti a great deal in the past several
years. Clear examples can be found in the first of the Nonsense
Madrigals (&ldquo;Two Dreams and Little Bat,&rdquo; 1988), and the third and fifth
movements of the Piano Concerto (1985&ndash;88), among other pieces.<p>
<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>4. Polyrhythm and Micropolyphony in Ligeti&rsquo;s Music</b></p>

<p>

[4.1]  Although complex polyrhythms have appeared in Ligeti&rsquo;s music ever
since he came to the West&mdash;nearly every score abounds in simultaneous
layers of triplets, sixteenth notes, quintuplets, and so on&mdash;the
difference between the earlier pieces and the etudes lies in a
different concept of pulse. In many earlier works, the pulse is
divided into two, three, and so on&mdash;even thirteenth-tuplets
occasionally appear. The effect of these different subdivisions,
especially when they occur simultaneously, is to blur the sonic
landscape, creating a micropolyphonic web of sound. The smallest
common denominator of all these subdivisions is a microscopic fraction
of a beat; no one can hear it, much less count it. (Watching someone
conduct one of these works produces a curious sensation of feeling a
pulse primarily from a visual, not auditory, cue.  This &ldquo;virtual pulse&rdquo;
is difficult to interpret: is it simply a visual by-product for the
audience&mdash;much as Ligeti&rsquo;s barlines are a by-product of the musical
notation&mdash;or is it an integral part of the musical experience which is
missing in a recording, like the final, long rests which mark the end
of a typical Ligeti work?)<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p>

[4.2]  To a lesser degree, many of Chopin&rsquo;s polyrhythms work in the
same, &ldquo;micropolyphonic&rdquo; way. In the excerpt from the F-minor Ballade, for example, the left hand plays sixteenth notes, while the right
plays sixteenth-note triplets. The &ldquo;smallest common denominator&rdquo; of
this duple vs. triple pattern, especially at such a fast tempo, is
vanishingly small: 1/12 of an eighth-note duration in length.
 <p>


[4.3]  On the other hand, the etudes, as well as some earlier Ligeti
keyboard works including <i>Continuum</i>, <i>Coulee</i> and the 
&ldquo;Self-portrait&rdquo;
from Three Pieces for Two Pianos, conceive of the pulse as a musical
atom, a common denominator, a basic unit which cannot be divided any
further. Different rhythms appear through <i>multiplications</i> of the
basic pulse, rather than <i>divisions</i>.  In 
effect, the blurred rhythmic
patterns are now magnified; instead of out-of-focus landscapes, one
perceives complex patterns with definition, almost like images of
fractal coastlines. Ligeti writes, &ldquo;In a piece such as Continuum where
I (consciously) tried to create an illusionary rhythm, I came
(unconsciously) close to the rhythmic conception evident in the music
of sub-Saharan Africa.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> <p>

[4.4]  Ligeti describes how these &ldquo;illusionary rhythms&rdquo; contribute to
the sixth Etude:
<p>

<blockquote>
<nobr>. . .</nobr>the pianist plays an even succession of notes. The piece is
notated in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> (although the barlines as such are not audible), with sixteen fast pulses per measure. There is however a place in the piece
where the right hand accentuates every fifth pulse and the left every
third. To the ear, these chains of accents blend together to form a
super-signal consisting of two melodies: a slower one formed by the
groupings of five and a faster one formed by the groupings of
three. The ratio 5:3 is of course mathematically simple, but
perceptually very complex. We do not count the pulses but rather
experience two qualitatively different tempo levels.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></blockquote>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 4</b>.

<p>

[4.5]   The fast pulses form a kind of background 
ostinato, usually a
single pitch class in arpeggiated octaves, as shown below in <b>Example 4</b>. Above this ostinato, notes are accented every five pulses, or
three, or four, etc., to form melodies of descending, chromatic
scales. This descending melody (or &ldquo;Lamento motif,&rdquo; as the composer
has called it) plays a prominent role in Ligeti&rsquo;s recent
scores&mdash;indeed, the emotional directness of the motif is one of the
hallmarks of Ligeti&rsquo;s recent music.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>  But it 
permeates &ldquo;Automne a
Varsovie&rdquo; more than any other piece, giving the music a stark, almost
obsessive air of grief. As Richard Steinitz writes, the etude
&ldquo;embodies anxieties stemming from the political unrest in Poland
during the early 1980s (hence the dedication &lsquo;to my Polish friends&rsquo;
and the Chopinesque character of its arpeggiated figurations).&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup><p>

[4.6] From a compositional standpoint, Ligeti&rsquo;s 
different tempo levels
probably would not work with any melodic material other than simple
scales. Without timbral differences to help the listener parse the
various lines, a more complicated melody in different simultaneous
tempi would sound like a succession of irregular arpeggios&mdash;in fact,
pieces like Steve Reich&rsquo;s <i>Piano Phase</i>, some of Nancarrow&rsquo;s
Studies for Player Piano,<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> and Ligeti&rsquo;s twelfth etude, &ldquo;Entrelacs,&rdquo;
exploit a similar effect. Even in the sixth etude, the more
contrapuntal passages are difficult not to perceive as subtly shifting
arpeggios. The pianist requires a superb sense of touch to distinguish
the densely woven lines.
<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>5. Form and Tempo Fugue in &ldquo;Automne a 
Varsovie&rdquo;</b></p>

<p>[5.1]   Ligeti has evocatively described the 
sixth etude as a &ldquo;tempo
fugue.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> This label, as we shall 
see, is not a mere metaphor, but
actually describes the underlying form of the piece. Ligeti
&ldquo;disguises&rdquo; this underlying form, though, in the surface of the
composition. On the surface, the etude, 122 measures long, is a
quasi-binary form. A brief, pianissimo interlude at the top and bottom
of the keyboard (measures 55&ndash;62) splits the piece into two roughly equal
parts (measures 1&ndash;54 and 62&ndash;122). The interlude stands out because of its
registral extremes, soft dynamic, and the absence of the background
ostinato, which is otherwise always present. (The interlude can be
heard at the beginning of Example 7 below.)</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>

[5.2] Both large parts of the piece end suddenly. Shortly before the
halfway point, an enormous climax vanishes into the pianissimo
interlude just mentioned, while in the final bars, constantly
accelerating scales crash off the bottom of the keyboard with the
classic Ligeti indication, &ldquo;Stop suddenly as though torn off, dry
(<i>aufhoren wie abgerissen, secco</i>).&rdquo; A closer look at the piece reveals
similar gestures throughout: a crescendo to a climax, followed by
subito pianissimo&mdash;or at the end of the piece, silence. As <b>Example 5</b>
shows, there are seven climaxes in all, three in the first half of the
piece and four in the second. These seven climaxes are the formal
building-blocks of the etude. Although each climax consists of a
crescendo followed by near or total silence, each is approached
differently, through voice-leading, rhythm, and register&mdash;some
climaxes propel themselves outward in contrary motion, while others
focus inward in various registers. As we shall see, this variety of
gesture is especially remarkable given the strict compositional
limitations Ligeti sets for himself. Since each climax tends to be
more violent than the ones preceding it, the form of the entire piece
can be seen as a single crescendo of climaxes which ultimately
vanishes.<p>

<a name="5.3">[5.3]</a> After the fifth climax, the most violent so far, the initial <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> ostinato returns, but now on a single pitch notated as <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (see Example 4 above). For the first time since the beginning of the piece the ostinato appears by itself, with no descending scales above it. The
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&rsquo;s reappearance thus produces a sense of return which complicates the two-part interpretation of the form discussed above, making it a kind of &ldquo;rounded binary.&rdquo; (<a href="#5.18">link to paragraph 5.18</a><nobr>. . .</nobr>)<p>

[5.4]  Underneath the form of progressive climaxes, divided halfway
through by a pianissimo interlude, Ligeti employs a unique fugal
technique. To understand how this fugue works, we must examine closely
the opening section (or exposition, measures 1&ndash;24), in which Ligeti
introduces the ideas for the entire piece.
<p>

<b>&ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; measures 1&ndash;24 (Exposition)</b></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>. Analytical reduction of &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; mm. 1&ndash;24</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="taylor_examples.php?id=5&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 6 thumbnail" src="taylor_ex6_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[5.5] The opening section consists of three phrases: A (measures 1&ndash;9), B
(measures 10&ndash;17), and C (measures 18&ndash;24). Each phrase contains three smaller
phrases, each more elaborate than the one preceding; this increasing
complexity propels the music to its first climax. The first sound is
the above-mentioned ostinato of sixteenth notes, arpeggiated over four
octaves on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. Although no accents are marked, since the figure is always arpeggiated from the lowest to the highest, one hears a pattern
of 4/16, articulated by register (see Example 4).
<p>

[5.6]  After five repetitions of the arpeggiated background ostinato,
the Lamento motif appears (measure 2), played in octaves in the upper
register (see Example 4 above). Since the melody is accented in fives,
while the ostinato is arpeggiated in fours, a five-against-four
polyrhythm results. The aural result, though, is not a polyrhythm, but
rather two separate entities juxtaposed: a background ostinato and a
foreground, falling lament which sounds subtly &ldquo;off,&rdquo; not unlike a
rubato performance of a Chopin nocturne. The tempo marking, &ldquo;Presto
cantabile, molto ritmico e flessibile&rdquo; expresses the paradoxical
nature of the music: it achieves a &ldquo;super-Chopin,&rdquo; illusory rubato
effect through strict polyrhythm.
<p>

[5.7]  The melody descends by half-steps except when it encounters the
ostinato <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, which it skips over. For much of the piece, the
melody carefully avoids the background ostinato pitch class. The
melody&rsquo;s opening <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (measure 2), a half-step above the ostinato <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, has the character of an appoggiatura&mdash;one, though, that misses its resolution (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) and continues to slip away, to D, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, then C (measures 2&ndash;3). Part of the music&rsquo;s emotional impact derives from this &ldquo;broken appoggiatura,&rdquo; a falling dissonance which overshoots its
resolution, never to return.
<p>

<b>Phrase A (measures 1&ndash;9)</b></p>


<p>[5.8] In the first bars Ligeti introduces the intensifying processes
that will drive the rest of the opening section. As mentioned above,
Phrase A is subdivided into three sub-phrases, a1 (measures 2&ndash;3), a2
(measures 3&ndash;5), and a3 (measures 5&ndash;9&mdash;see the analytic reduction, Example 6). A doubled duration (10 sixteenths instead of 5) marks the end of each sub-phrase. In each sub-phrase, the melody descends farther, always skipping the ostinato <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. Also, each phrase is longer than its predecessor, although sub-phrase a3 is much longer&mdash;nearly the length of a1, a2 and the introductory ostinato combined.<p>

[5.9]  Sub-phrase a3 also differs from the first two in several other
ways (marked by asterisks in the analytic reduction). The melody
begins (measure 5) with a pitch and agogic accent: a long, accented
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>, a half-step higher than the beginning of phrases a1 and
a2. The <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> is also harmonized with a lower major seventh (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>), strikingly dissonant compared to the octaves before. As the melody
progresses downward, it is twice interrupted by small lifts (measures 7 and
8); each of these, too, is harmonized with a major seventh,
emphasizing their delaying, intensifying function. The second
interruption, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>/D, is stronger than the first, thanks to its doubled duration. From a larger view, some of these &ldquo;interrupting&rdquo; notes contribute to a slow, background melodic ascent (these rising notes
are circled in the analytic reduction).
<p>

<b>Phrases B (measures 10&ndash;17) and C (measures 18&ndash;24)</b></p>

<p>[5.10]  Phrases B and C repeat and amplify the intensifying processes
begun in phrase A. Phrase B adds a lower perfect fifth to the melody&rsquo;s
octave; it also begins on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, a half-step higher than the highest pitch of Phrase A. The interrupting pitches in phrase b3 (measures 13 and 15) are more dissonant&mdash;[0 1 6]&mdash;than those in a3 (a major
seventh). Also, phrase b3 embeds an ascending line into its harmonies
(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> A <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> B C, measures 15&ndash;16; ascents like this one will reappear in the second half of the piece). Finally, in phrase b2 a left-hand line starts on G, then &ldquo;peels off&rdquo; to become a line of its own, going down to low C. As Example 6 shows, this left-hand line gradually
accelerates, at first appearing as half notes (eight 16ths), then
moving to six, five and finally four 16ths.
<p>

[5.11] Phrase C begins on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (measure 18, a whole step higher than the highest pitch in phrase B), now harmonized in parallel tritones. In
the middle register a new melodic voice appears on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, accented in threes (end of measure18, marked in red in 
Example 6). This is the place
described above by Ligeti (paragaph 4.4) in the ratio 5:3, a peculiar
kind of mensural canon. The bass adds its own imitation in 4/16, in
measures 20&ndash;21. Finally, the end of phrase c3 is truncated as the melody
and its mid-register imitation coincide rhythmically in measure 24,
producing the first climax of the piece. As after each climax, subito
pianissimo follows immediately (in this case, with an echo of phrase
c3 in 3/16, right hand of measures 25&ndash;26). The music relaxes for a moment
before the next, large-scale crescendo.
<p>

[5.12] Having examined the threefold structure of the Lamento motif and
its development in the opening section of the piece, we can now
reconsider the etude&rsquo;s form. Following Ligeti&rsquo;s suggestion of a &ldquo;tempo
fugue,&rdquo; the threefold phrase (the Lamento motif) can be taken as the
subject; whenever a melody does not fit the three-fold Lamento
pattern, the passage is most likely some kind of &ldquo;episode.&rdquo; The piece
divides then into exposition and episode as shown below (see also
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('taylor_examples.php?id=4',700,450); return false;" href="taylor_examples.php?id=4">Example 5</a>):

<li>measures 112&ndash;122   Coda
</ol>
<p>

The exposition, in which imitative voices gradually enter at different
tempo levels, is followed by two &ldquo;episodes&rdquo; (measures 25&ndash;54), in which
chromatically descending scales, mostly in the tempo relationship 5:3,
permeate the texture. They do not, though, divide into three clear
phrases as in the exposition. Instead they seem to echo parts of the
motif (Episodes 1 and 4), or else flow seamlessly, with no clear
phrase divisions (Episodes 2 and 3). Unexpectedly, the section of the
piece which sounds least like the others&mdash;the pianissimo interlude
(measures 55&ndash;62)&mdash;actually begins a re-exposition, labeled as phrases D, E
and F in the analytic reduction (see <b>Example 7</b>).
<p>

<b>&ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; Re-exposition (measures 55&ndash;85)</b></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>

[5.13]  Like the beginning, the re-exposition (measures 55&ndash;85) gradually
builds to a climax. In Phrase D (which I first labeled as the
interlude, measures 55&ndash;62&mdash;see Example 5), the ostinato drops out, leaving
the melody in bare, parallel tritones in extreme registers. The phrase
ends with a tritone F/B (measure 62), which dissolves into a new ostinato,
quietly oscillating in the extreme upper register: the foreground
becomes the background.
<p>

[5.14]  Because of the ostinato&rsquo;s reappearance in measure 62, Phrase E
(measures 62&ndash;72) sounds more like a new beginning than a continuation. It
presents a new harmonization of the subject, in which lower voices
climb as the melody descends (reminiscent of phrase b3 from the
opening, measures 15&ndash;16). The melody is now in 7/16, a new, slower
tempo. The background arpeggios are now in a 5/16 pattern, the former
tempo of the melody.
<p>

[5.15]  As Phrase E continues erratically downward, the ostinato hits 
the
very top of the keyboard and starts to descend, like a marble bouncing
off a wall (measure 73). At this moment Phrase F, a single line starting on
C, enters in 4/16 (quarter notes&mdash;until now only the ostinato has used
this speed). From here to the next climax (measure 85), all three tempo
levels&mdash;5/16 (the ostinato), 7/16 (phrase E) and 4/16 (phrase F)
continue together. To summarize, the re-exposition&rsquo;s surface differs
from its underlying form: while Phrase D sounds like an interlude and
Phrase E sounds like a new beginning, in fact Phrase D is the
beginning of a fugal re-exposition. The texture of the surface
obscures the compositional technique.
<p>

[5.16]   Hidden techniques 
have occupied Ligeti since the days of his
micropolyphonic works. <i>Lux Aeterna</i> (1966) and <i>Lontano</i> 
(1967),
among other pieces, employ canons which are hidden by overlapping
entries, each layered over the other so that one hears a slowly
shifting mass of sound, rather than a melodic line being imitated.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>In &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; Ligeti adopts this disguising technique on
the formal level to produce an &ldquo;inaudible fugue.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
<p>

<b>Episodes 3 and 4, Coda</b></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 8</b>.

<p>[5.17]  The fugal re-exposition is followed by a third episode
(measures 87&ndash;98) in which the melody is again treated more freely. Now,
imitative entries successively pile onto one another in a way which
resembles a stretto. The melody enters first in 3/16, then 4/16, and
finally 5/16, creating an accumulation of progressively slower
voices. Once all the voices have entered, though, they begin to
accelerate and spread in contrary motion towards the fifth climax of
the piece (fff+, measure 98).
<p>

<a name="5.18">[5.18]</a>  Then follows Episode 4 (measures 99&ndash;112), in which the opening
pitch-class <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> returns. Again, this return to the bare ostinato
(producing the &ldquo;rounded binary&rdquo; formal interpretation <a href="#5.3">discussed above</a>)
helps obscure the fugal compositional technique. This section is also
a quasi-stretto, but now the voices enter in progressively faster
values, focusing inward to climaxes in the middle register. Finally in
measure 112 the coda appears. A shortened Lamento motif, once again in
5/16, rises above a cacophony of other voices. Its last phrase takes
the entire piece to its astonishing but inevitable conclusion: the
constantly accelerating subject gathers each strand of melody and
collapses through the piano&rsquo;s lowest octave.
<p>
[5.19]  To summarize Ligeti&rsquo;s technique of tempo fugue in &ldquo;Automne a 
Varsovie&rdquo;:<p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>It has a subject (the Lamento motif) which is imitated at different
tempo levels to make expositions, and varied in different ways to make
episodes. Dynamic climaxes mark each exposition and episode.<p>

<li>The different tempo levels appear in both exposition and episode and
continue through most of the piece with only one major interruption
(the interlude, measures 55&ndash;62).
<p>

<li>Since the perception of these tempo levels depends on simple scales
(more complicated melodies would be too difficult to parse), there is
no &ldquo;countersubject&rdquo; per se, only the descending scales of the Lamento
motif superimposed over the background pulse.
</ul>
<p>


<p style="text-align: center"><b>6. Conclusion: Paradoxes of Perception and Style</b></p>

<p>

[6.1]   One of the issues running submerged 
through this essay has been
the question of perception. Can a rhythm be &ldquo;illusory?&rdquo; Do Chopin&rsquo;s
complex polyrhythms really produce a rubato effect? The question is
subjective, as any issue about perception must be to some extent.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>Hofstadter, though, writing about Chopin, suggests a solution which
seems to ring true to Ligeti&rsquo;s spirit:
<p>
 

<blockquote>
<nobr>. . .</nobr>phenomena perceived to be magical are always the outcome of
complex patterns of <i>nonmagical</i> activities taking place at a level
below perception. More succinctly: the magic behind magic is
pattern.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>
 
Ligeti considers his earlier, pattern-based works&mdash;especially the
notorious <i>Poeme Symphonique pour 100 Metronomes</i>&mdash;important
precursors to the piano etudes. This &ldquo;pattern-meccanico&rdquo; style,<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> combined with the melodic expressiveness of the Lamento motif and the
rigors of fugue technique, produces (at least for this listener) a
magical result.

[6.2]   Finally, &ldquo;Automne a Varsovie,&rdquo; like most 
recent Ligeti, is both
reminiscent of, and strangely alien to, music of the past. Ligeti does
not attempt to continue in the &ldquo;avant garde&rdquo; style of his 60s works;
nor is he assembling a post-modern collage of older styles. Instead,
by synthesizing older musical styles through his own previously
established, idiosyncratic techniques, Ligeti maintains his musical
individuality&mdash;a goal which has long obsessed him. Or as he says, &ldquo;By
rejecting both the &lsquo;retro&rsquo; and the former avant-garde, I declare for
myself a modernism of today.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
This reclaiming of the past, of
harmony, melody, and finally form, is a well-documented process he
began in the sixties, which I believe has started to see its full
fruition since the 1980s. This stylistic evolution, as much as
anything else, lies at the core of Ligeti&rsquo;s recent music.</p>
