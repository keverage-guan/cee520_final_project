<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1]   Ethan Haimo&rsquo;s recent article, &ldquo;Atonality, Analysis, and the Intentional Fallacy,&rdquo; is both interesting and 
provocative.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  If read from a 
certain point of view, it 
would seem that Haimo is interested in resurrecting 
Nattiez&rsquo;s tripartition (poietic/neutral/esthesic) and 
paradigmatic method of analysis, discussing as he does 
the notions of &ldquo;coherence based on repetition,&rdquo; &ldquo;the 
score itself,&rdquo; and &ldquo;two types of statements about music,&rdquo; 
involving composition (poietics) and perception 
(esthesics).  But such is not the case, and the 
tripartition will have to wait for another time.  What 
Haimo <i>is</i> interested in, however, is the issue of 
intentionality and its putative role in musical analysis, 
and Nattiez&rsquo;s name will therefore resurface in this 
review in connection with this most thorny, but 
potentially revelatory of music-analytical topics.
 <p>


[2]  Haimo divides his article into four sections, which 
might be labeled &ldquo;Schoenberg and Intentionality,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Intentionality Revisited,&rdquo; &ldquo;Forte and Intentionality,&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;Schoenberg and Developing Variation.&rdquo;  In his first 
section, he presents the case against Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
intentional use of pitch-class sets (as they are 
conceived of in Allen Forte&rsquo;s system) in his atonal 
compositions.  After presenting a tidy, if not entirely 
objective, encapsulation of the controversy that Forte&rsquo;s 
undaunted application of his theory to the analysis of 
that very same music has engendered, Haimo produces 
several handsome plates of very official-looking sketch 
materials.  His approach, like Perle&rsquo;s approach to Berg 
before him, is to infer, based on the superabundance of 
row charts and other pre-compositional calculations in the 
sketches for the twelve-tone works, that Schoenberg did 
not compose with pitch-class sets in his atonal music, 
since no similar materials have yet been discovered for 
those works.

<p>



[3]  Haimo&rsquo;s argument here consists of a very carefully 
hedged bet.  In his second section, where he again 
provides a helpful summary of intellectual controversy, 
this time concerning the intentional fallacy itself,  
Haimo cautiously draws the distinction between &ldquo;conscious 
intentions&rdquo; and &ldquo;intuitive behavior,&rdquo; declaring himself 
to be interested exclusively in the former (page 178, note 29).  In making such a declaration, however, he is in 
fact dodging a good deal of the issue altogether.  If 
&ldquo;documentary evidence&rdquo; from a composer like Wagner, who 
claimed to have &ldquo;forgotten all theory&rdquo; in the composition 
of his masterworks, is to be accepted, then 
unintentional, or intuitive, use of structural devices 
must be included in the consideration of intentionality 
(see par [6] below).  Haimo, however, seems to believe 
categorically that &ldquo;complicated and thoroughgoing 
procedures&rdquo; cannot possibly be intuitive (page 179).
<p>

[4]  As he continues his discussion of intentionality, 
Haimo isolates two possible types of music-analytical 
statements, the first concerning the compositional 
process and the second concerning the score itself.  The 
first of these, he maintains, must be validated by 
&ldquo;documentary or stylistic support,&rdquo; while the second 
requires only perceptual confirmation.  He also 
introduces the notion of persuasiveness, yet implicitly 
exempts type-one statements from its requirements.  It 
seems reasonable, however, to apply the requirement of 
persuasiveness (or perhaps &ldquo;meta-persuasiveness&rdquo;) to 
<i>both</i> types of statements, in that any analytical essay, 
whether type-one or type-two, is an attempt to persuade a 
reader to adopt a particular point of view.

<p>


[5]  One is struck by the seeming naivete of Haimo&rsquo;s 
trust in &ldquo;documentary evidence.&rdquo;  Not only does he seem 
to consider it a &ldquo;get-out-of-jail-free card&rdquo; with respect 
to persuasiveness, but he includes the widest possible 
assortment of documents under the rubric of &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo; 
including letters, theoretical works, notes of 
explanation, explanatory essays, and testimony by 
students or colleagues, in addition to the aforementioned 
calculations or diagrams found in sketch materials (page 179). As a composer, Haimo must be aware that his 
colleagues are not always to be trusted on the subject of 
their own works; one need only think of the numerous 
anecdotes concerning Stravinskian and Schoenbergian 
smokescreening on the subject of the influence of the 
text on their compositional decisions in texted works.  For a more specific example of this 
unreliability, one 
could look to Jonathan Bernard&rsquo;s critique of the use of 
documentary evidence by Nattiez in his analysis of 
<i>Density 21.5.</i><sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  In a recent review of a <i>Spectrum</i> 
article published in <i>Music Theory Online</i>, Jane 
Clendinning summarizes the problem, noting that &ldquo;a 
composer&rsquo;s comments on his music should be examined 
critically (comments may be used to obfuscate rather than 
enlighten).&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>
<p>


[6]  In a posting to the smt-list  that ignited a 
brief but lively exchange of ideas, I discussed intentionality 
and the uncritical acceptance of documentary evidence at 
some length, in reference to the works of Wagner and 
Webern. Concerning the former, my 
conclusion was that 
Wagner <i>claimed</i> he was disregarding his &ldquo;theoretical 
scruples,&rdquo; as he put it, both to distinguish himself as a 
creative individual and to throw music-analytical sleuths 
off his trail.  By saying that he had composed <i>Tristan</i> 
in &ldquo;complete freedom . . . in an uncritical frame of mind,&rdquo; 
Wagner was attempting to erase his tracks so that no one 
could follow in his footsteps, thereby preserving an aura 
of mystique about the compositional process.  The lesson 
to be learned here is that composers&rsquo; comments on their 
own music are not dependable as sources of documentary 
evidence.<p>

[7]  By the time he arrives at his critique of Forte&rsquo;s 
analysis of op. 11/1, Haimo has worked himself into a 
pretty good lather.  Although his critique of Forte&rsquo;s 
segmentational decisions is perceptive and valid, several 
elements of his argument weaken the whole.  First of all, 
he uses the earlier of Forte&rsquo;s two analyses of op. 11/1 
(from &ldquo;Magical Kaleidoscope&rdquo; [1981]), which, he admits in 
a footnote (note 39), contains much less detail and 
analytical information than the later one, from &ldquo;Pitch-
Class Set Analysis Today&rdquo; (1985).  Secondly, his 
discussion of Forte&rsquo;s segmentational criteria is based on 
an outdated article (&ldquo;Sets and Nonsets in Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
Atonal Music&rdquo; [1972]).  The fourth criterion that Haimo 
cites from the article (that the set ought to be &ldquo;an 
&lsquo;atonal&rsquo; set, not a set that would occur in a tonal 
work,&rdquo; note 42) reflects Forte&rsquo;s early, pre-genera, 
thinking on the subject of segmentation; &ldquo;tonal&rdquo; sets 
such as 4-27 and 4-28 are regularly featured in his 
current analyses of atonal repertoire.
<p>


[8]  The use of the earlier analysis is 
indicative of 
Haimo&rsquo;s almost exclusive reliance on sources dating from 
the ten-year period from 1972&ndash;1981 in his critique of 
Forte&rsquo;s methods, with the majority of his theoretical 
citations drawn from &ldquo;Sets and Non-Sets in Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
Music&rdquo; (1972), and <i>The Structure of Atonal Music</i> 
(1973).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  He draws the rest of his 
citations from works 
written between 1977 and 1985, thereby excluding many 
important works, including the articles on Berg (1985, 
1991), Debussy (1989), Musorgsky (1990), Liszt (1990), 
and Webern (1994).  Moreover, many of his criticisms of 
Forte are based on citations drawn from the polemical 
exchange between Forte and Taruskin (e.g. &ldquo;Letter to the 
Editor from Allen Forte&rdquo;), rather than from the more 
detailed and comprehensive expositions of pitch-class set 
theory to be found elsewhere.  

<p>


[9]  By contrast, Haimo conscientiously utilizes 
the most 
up-to-date information available in support of his own 
views, relying upon articles published between 1990&ndash;1994.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  In the twenty-fifth 
anniversary year of the 
publication of &ldquo;Sets and Non-Sets,&rdquo; (and on the eve of 
<i>Structure of Atonal Music&rsquo;s</i> 25th birthday, as well) it 
seems appropriate, indeed necessary, to take into account 
the evolution of Forte&rsquo;s own thinking on the subject of 
pitch-class set analysis, as well as the contributions of 
his students and colleagues on the subject.
<p>

[10]  In general, the sources Haimo omits point to a new 
method of segmentation, that, in 1981 when &ldquo;The Magical 
Kaleidoscope&rdquo; was written, Forte had not even begun to 
develop&mdash;namely, segmentation based on a <i>linear</i> 
approach to the analysis of post-tonal music.  After 
immersing himself in Schenker&rsquo;s theories in order to 
complete his <i>Introduction to Schenkerian Analysis</i> with 
Steven Gilbert in 1982, Forte published three articles 
devoted to linear analysis of late nineteenth-century 
music: one on the Brahms <i>Alto Rhapsody</i> (1983), one on 
the Brahms C-minor String Quartet (1983), and one on 
Mahler&rsquo;s Fifth Symphony (1984).  These articles, cited in 
Beach (1985) as an example of how to extend the 
possibilities of Schenkerian analytical techniques, 
began to develop a system of motivic analysis at multiple 
structural levels that has been a focus of Forte&rsquo;s work 
ever since.<p>

[11]  &ldquo;Pitch-Class Set Analysis Today&rdquo; (1985), then&mdash;the 
most recent article to which Haimo makes reference&mdash;is 
actually Forte&rsquo;s own attempt to signal the <i>end</i> of an 
initial phase in the evolution of pitch-class set theory 
and the beginning of a new phase in which a more 
sophisticated analytical method might be developed.  He 
presented a general outline of such a method in &ldquo;New 
Approaches to Linear Analysis&rdquo; (1988).  
Analytical decisions, he says, are to be made on the basis of three 
criteria: 1) aural salience; 2) motivic replication; and 
3) coincidence of onset and closure.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>  These criteria 
are used to identify primary and secondary segments of a 
different sort: linear and harmonic motives that are 
present at different levels of musical structure.  This 
method leans far more heavily toward Haimo&rsquo;s &ldquo;type-one&rdquo; 
assertions about music (statements that explain something 
about how the music itself sounds), relying as it does 
upon aurally salient criteria like register, dynamics, 
timbre, texture, and rhythm.<p>

[12]  That &ldquo;New Approaches to Linear Analysis&rdquo;  was 
published in 1988 is surely more than coincidental; it is 
a direct response to the criticisms of the work of Salzer 
(1952), Travis (1969), and Morgan (1976) by Baker (1983) 
and Straus (1987). Forte attempts to distance himself 
from Schenker and the problems associated with invoking 
his ideas for atonal music by using the general term 
&ldquo;linear analysis,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Schenkerian analysis.&rdquo;  
Perhaps, if only to rankle Eugene Narmour, it would be 
best to dub this method &ldquo;post-Schenkerian&rdquo; linear 
analysis, since it is clear (and Forte makes no effort to 
deny it) that his ideas are inspired to a large extent by 
the work of Schenker.
<p>

[13]   Forte has applied linear analysis in a series of 
important articles, including the pieces mentioned in 
paragraph [8].  Most recently, he has turned again to 
more traditional Schenkerian techniques to explain the 
music of Porter and Gershwin, among others (in<i>The 
American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era 1924&ndash;1950</i> 
[1995]).  Perhaps most relevant to Haimo&rsquo;s critique, 
however, is Forte&rsquo;s discussion of<i>Das Buch den Hangenden 
Garten</i> in &ldquo;Concepts of Linearity in Schoenberg&rsquo;s Atonal 
Music: A Study of the Opus 15 Song Cycle&rdquo; (1992).  Given 
that Haimo is specifically interested in discrediting 
Forte&rsquo;s approach to Schoenberg&rsquo;s atonal music, it seems 
rather surprising (and unfortunate) that he chooses to 
ignore this particular article.
<p>


[14]   If Forte&rsquo;s linear approach represents a fundamental 
change in methods of segmentation and derivation of 
structural sets, then &ldquo;Pitch-Class Set Genera and the 
Origin of the Modern Harmonic Species&rdquo; (1988) represents 
a change in methods of categorizing the resultant sets.  
Intended to supercede the K and Kh relations as a means 
of describing the relationships among the different sets 
employed (or discovered, <i>pace</i> Haimo) in a composition, 
the system of genera is clearly a further refinement of 
pitch-class set theory, and as such it, too, needs to be 
included in any evaluation of the theory and its 
analytical application.<p>

[15]  As far as Haimo&rsquo;s own analytical proposals are 
concerned, they are built on tenuous conclusions about 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s relationship to the idea of developing 
variation. Whether he actually used developing variation 
as a compositional tool or not, Schoenberg clearly had an 
agenda for citing it as an important influence on his 
work.  As Haimo notes, Schoenberg discusses the 
concept 
in an essay on Bach and it has since been linked to 
Brahms, as well (page 192, note 55). As a neoclassicist and 
a great admirer of Brahms, Schoenberg would have wanted 
to be associated with the same compositional 
technique.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>  Furthermore, 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s definition of 
coherence as being based on repetition, and his 
association of coherence with comprehensibility and the 
need for effective communication (page 192), points to a 
composer attempting belatedly to justify some very 
complex music.  Similarly, in his analysis of op. 22, 
Schoenberg is trying to prove the coherence of his music, 
so that he will be less &ldquo;difficult to understand&rdquo; (page 193).  Thus, when he declares that his analytical 
approach &ldquo;may well be compatible with what we know of 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s intentions,&rdquo; (page 198) Haimo is begging the 
question: what exactly <i>do</i> we know about them?<p>

[16]  Further problems arise when Haimo attempts to 
appropriate Schoenberg&rsquo;s notion of developing variation 
for the purposes of his own analysis.  Although 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s general definition of the concept refers to 
a procedure of variation in which the changes proceed 
<i>toward</i> the goal of allowing new ideas to arise (page 192, 
emphasis added), Haimo prefers to focus on information 
gleaned from Schoenberg&rsquo;s op. 22 analysis to justify his 
identification of motives that &ldquo;come back and fill in the 
missing steps&rdquo; from one variation to another, more 
remote one (page 195).  Yet, in his summary of developing 
variation in op. 11/1, Haimo again refers to a process in 
which &ldquo;changes made in one place invariably are taken up 
later to create new ideas, which are themselves subjected 
to further transformations in a continuous process of 
<i>forward</i> motion&rdquo; (page 197, emphasis added).  Thus, 
Schoenberg is invoked twice to justify differing 
analytical points.  

<p>

[17]  And what of Haimo the composer-theorist&rsquo;s 
intentions?  From his conclusion, it would seem that he 
fears &ldquo;the substitution of the analyst for the composer 
as the figure of authority for the validity of 
interpretations&rdquo; (page 199).  Yet he argues (persuasively) 
for the need for persuasiveness in type-two statements 
about music (page 179), thereby implying that the <i>reader</i> 
(or audience member) towards which an interpretation is 
directed is the ultimate arbiter of validity, and I 
strongly support this view.  His concern that the 
composer will be reduced to &ldquo;an almost accidental figure&rdquo; 
seems to stem from his compositional side; yet his 
theoretical side ought to tell him that &ldquo;the 
analyst&rsquo;s assumptions, and not the composer&rsquo;s&rdquo; are 
<i>unavoidably</i> the determining features of an analysis, 
and that &ldquo;flights of analytical fancy&rdquo; are desirable, not 
suspect.  The task is to convince the reader to come 
along for the ride.</p>
