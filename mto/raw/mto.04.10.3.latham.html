<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In his recent book, <i>Exploring Twentieth-Century Music, </i>Arnold Whittall 
  gathers together six lectures he gave in London, revising and supplementing 
  them with additional chapters meant to flesh out a central theme&mdash;namely, that 
  twentieth-century compositional thought was predominantly influenced by the 
  centrifugal pull of opposing forces: tradition and innovation, Classicism and 
  Modernism, Apollonianism and Dionysianism. Over a span of eleven chapters, 
  Whittall discusses or refers to over two hundred and thirty pieces in varying 
  styles and genres by fifty different composers from over fourteen countries, 
  from Debussy to Andriessen, situating works and composers in relationship to a 
continuum between the aesthetic &ldquo;counterpoles&rdquo; (page 23) established in his 
  introduction.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
<p>[2] Notwithstanding Whittall&rsquo;s caveat in the preface that &ldquo;while striving to 
  resist presumptions of absolute authority, I cannot deny that my chosen 
  materials are the result of value judgments preceding, and therefore 
  influencing, analysis&rdquo; (page vii), there are certain composers who are 
  conspicuous in their absence. Russian composers, for example, particularly 
  Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov, are not well represented, nor are French 
  composers such as Ravel and Satie. Nonetheless, the breadth of the book 
  showcases Whittall&rsquo;s encyclopedic knowledge of the repertoire, and his 
  refreshingly abundant references to operatic and large-scale choral works, 
  genres not normally associated with analysis, more than compensate for the 
  omissions noted above. As usual, the editors at Cambridge University Press 
  have turned out a superb text, commendable for its paucity of errors and 
  abundance of musical examples, but the true value of the book lies in the 
  flexibility and relevance of Whittall&rsquo;s interpretive approach, one that allows 
  him to cover a large, diverse, and up-to-date cross-section of the 
  twentieth-century repertory in a manner that is plausibly consistent with the 
  published reflections of composers on their own aesthetic philosophies.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p> [3] Despite the fact that the original lectures were delivered under the 
  auspices of the Society for Music Analysis, there is not as much analysis in 
  the book as the reader might have expected, given its promising title. 
  Particularly with regard to Chapters 1 through 7, the amended title &ldquo;Exploring 
  Twentieth Century Music(al) Aesthetics&rdquo; would have been equally apt, since 
  there is little analysis to be found in those chapters. Taking a 
  meta-theoretical approach that focuses largely on critiquing and 
  reinterpreting the work of other commentators on the pieces he includes, 
  Whittall runs the risk of becoming a jack-of-all-trades (theory, criticism, 
  musicology) and master of none. Occasionally, his generalized assessments 
  leave the reader wanting a more detailed explanation, as for example when he 
  describes Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s treatment of closure in the Sixth Quartet [1939] as 
  &ldquo;ambiguously decisive&rdquo; (page 51) or when he writes of &ldquo;unstable centredness&rdquo; (page 
  204) in Ligeti&rsquo;s Solo Viola Sonata [1991&ndash;4]. </p>
<p>[4] While Whittall&rsquo;s stated intent is to use &ldquo;multivalent critical 
  perspectives&rdquo; to promote a &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; interaction between formalism and 
  hermeneutics (page viii), a few of his analytical and hermeneutic observations 
  consequently seem tentative or watered-down. On the one hand, regarding the 
  structure of the first movement of Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 2, &ldquo;Intimate 
  Letters&rdquo; [1928], he identifies &ldquo;a degree of association and linkage at the 
  level of pitch organization and voice-leading,&rdquo; exemplified simply by &ldquo; <nobr>. . .</nobr> 
  the motivic connection of descending steps in the viola&rdquo; (page 38). Likewise, he 
  describes Scene 7 of Louis Andriessen&rsquo;s opera <i>Rosa</i> [1993&ndash;4] as embodying a 
  constrained lyricism in which &ldquo;the warm formality of the melodic writing is 
  darkened by dissonant accompanying chords, which fit with the bitterness 
  expressed in the text. Yet because there is no happy ending, lyric warmth 
  cannot prosper&rdquo; (page 171). On the other hand, after raising the possibility 
  that the quashing of what Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek might have considered &ldquo;feminine gestures of 
  remoteness and mystery&rdquo; (page 38) at the conclusion of the first movement of his 
  Second Quartet might be related to what Paul Wingfield has diagnosed as his 
  &ldquo;distasteful tendency to violence in his attitude to women&rdquo; (page 40), Whittall 
  then concedes that the possibility of such a connection is &ldquo;an unanswerable 
  question: but such questions soon pile in on critical commentaries which range 
  beyond the safe shores of purely technical interpretation&rdquo; (page 40). 
  Nonetheless, on balance he skillfully charts a course through the Scylla and Charybdis of arid technical description and vapid critical clich&eacute;s, emerging 
  as an &ldquo;interpretive musicologist&rdquo; (page 150) as comfortable hacking his way 
  through the dense thickets of modernist compositional practice as he is wading 
  into the swampy marshes of musical hermeneutics.</p>
<p>[5] Although he often cites Hans Keller, one of the foremost proponents of a 
  purely graphical approach to music analysis, Whittall&rsquo;s own approach does not 
  depend on the conventional theoretical apparatus of voice-leading graphs, row 
  charts, set-class tables or formal diagrams to do its rhetorical heavy 
  lifting. Two score excerpts annotated with row labels and four isolated 
  set-class identifications comprise the only theoretical examples in the book (Examples 
  2.4&ndash;2.6, 8.1b, 11.4b, and 11.5a). Instead, Whittall relies on the elegant 
  simplicity of his binary oppositions, the eloquent style of his prose and an 
  occasional Tovian turn of phrase to entice his reader into joining him on a 
  walkabout through the rich and varied landscape of twentieth-century music, 
  wrapping his frequently trenchant analytical observations in the soft lamb&rsquo;s 
  wool of music criticism.</p>

<p>[6] In all, Whittall refers to over seventy-five different oppositions, 
  beginning with the eponymous pairing Tradition-Innovation. As shown in <b>Tables 1a</b>
   and 
<b>1b</b>, these oppositions may be grouped into five categories according to 
  the fields they draw upon to ascribe extra-musical qualities to musical 
  structure: musicological, theoretical, sociological, psychological, and 
  theological. Although most of the musicological and theoretical pairings may 
  be considered subcategories of the Tradition-Innovation opposition (e.g., 
  Classicism-Modernism, Neoclassicism-Expressionism, Tonality-Atonality), 
  Whittall places a second opposition-Apollo-Dionysus&mdash;on equal footing with 
  Tradition-Innovation, and it is this second pairing that generates most of the 
  oppositions he discusses in the book (e.g., Order-Chaos, 
  Discipline-Subversion, Serenity-Ecstasy, Reservation-Abandon). Unlike 
  Tradition-Innovation, which is established in both the title and the preface 
  as central to Whittall&rsquo;s argument&mdash;he notes that &ldquo;in essence, 
  twentieth-century composition is seen as the result of a continuing, 
  intensifying dialogue between modernism and classicism which began quite early 
  in the nineteenth century, in the wake of the Enlightenment&rdquo; (page 
  vii)&mdash;Apollo-Dionysus, introduced in passing as a concept &ldquo;derived from 
  Nietzsche&rdquo; (page 23), begins as a subtle undercurrent and gradually gains 
  prominence in the later chapters of the book.</p>
<p>[7] The lack of an explicit definition of the Apollonian-Dionysian opposition 
  at the outset occasionally generates minor confusion for the reader. For 
  example, the adjective &ldquo;dithyrambic&rdquo; (page 38) is used to describe the opening 
  of Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 2, before that term is defined as connoting a 
  &ldquo;wild, vehement character <nobr>. . .</nobr> believed to belong to ancient Greek hymns to 
  Dionysus&rdquo; (page 44). In a subsequent section entitled &ldquo;Dithyramb&rdquo; (pages 62&ndash;5), 
  Whittall places a re-worded definition in quotation marks, even though it is 
  not an exact quotation: here, a dithyramb is &ldquo;an ancient Greek choric hymn, 
  vehement and wild in character&rdquo; (page 63).</p>
<p>[8] The strength of Whittall&rsquo;s argument for Apollo-Dionysus as a central 
  influence on twentieth-century compositional thought lies not only in his 
  convincing interpretations of works that juxtapose restraint and chaos, but 
  also in his ability to track down telling comments on the opposition itself by 
  influential composers from Schoenberg to Adams. He begins with Stravinsky, 
  whose ballets <i>Apollo</i> [1927] and <i>The Rite of Spring</i> make him an obvious choice 
  as a starting point.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> In his &ldquo;Poetics of Music&rdquo; lectures [1939&ndash;40], 
  Stravinsky writes that &ldquo;for the lucid ordering of the work <nobr>. . .</nobr> all the 
  Dionysian elements which set the imagination of the artist in motion <nobr>. . .</nobr> 
  must be properly subjugated before they intoxicate us, and must finally be 
  made to submit to the law&rdquo; (Whittall, pages 59, 171). A passage from his 
  autobiography, in which he praises the &ldquo;aristocratic austerity&rdquo; of classical 
  ballet, is even more explicit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For here, in classical dancing, I see the triumph of studied conception over 
  vagueness, of the rule over the arbitrary, of order over the haphazard. I am 
  thus brought face to face with the eternal conflict in art between the 
  Apollonian and the Dionysian principles. The latter assumes ecstasy to be the 
  final goal&mdash;that is so say, the losing of oneself&mdash;whereas art demands above 
  all the full consciousness of the artist. There can, therefore, be no doubt as 
  to my choice between the two (Whittall, page 170).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[9] Schoenberg, for his part, described both his own style, which took &ldquo;a 
  turn&mdash;perhaps you would call it to the Apollonian side&mdash;in the Suite for Seven 
  Instruments, op. 29 [1925&ndash;6]&rdquo; (page 73), and the aesthetic debate of his time, 
  which &ldquo;one might be inclined to call <nobr>. . .</nobr> an Apollonian period&rdquo; but which 
  also &ldquo;presents rather a Dionysian aspect&rdquo; (page 73, note 1), in terms of the 
  Apollonian-Dionysian opposition. Even John Adams made a passing reference to 
  his &ldquo;Dionysian side&rdquo; (page 181). Moreover, in addition to Stravinsky&rsquo;s ballet 
  <i>Apollo</i>, Whittall cites works by a wide range of composers that use Apollo, 
  Dionysus, or both as characters or central ideas, including Britten&rsquo;s <i>Young 
  Apollo</i> [1939] (page 91), Hans Werner Henze&rsquo;s opera <i>The Bassarids</i> [1964&ndash;5] (page 
  139), and Andriessen&rsquo;s <i>Rosa</i> (page 122).</p>
<p>[10] Three questions are raised by the interpretive framework constructed by 
  Whittall. First, can the two central themes of the book (Tradition-Innovation 
  and Apollo-Dionysus) be conflated? Do Apollonian order and serenity represent 
  tradition, while Dionysian chaos and abandon signify innovation? Second, how 
  are the opposing forces Whittall describes related to one another? Are they 
  merely antithetical, or do they participate in (Hegelian) dialectical 
  relationships? Finally, if the music analyst were to use Whittall&rsquo;s approach 
  as a conceptual framework, what changes would it necessitate in 
  currently-available analytical methodologies, or what new methodologies might 
  be suggested by it?</p>
<p>[11] At first glance, the Tradition-Innovation (T/I) and Apollo-Dionysus (A/D) 
  pairings appear to be only tenuously related. True, Dionysus is frequently 
  associated with the impassioned outbursts of creativity required to spark 
  innovation, but cool Apollonian logic and organization are essential to bring 
  those &ldquo;pipe dreams&rdquo; to fruition. Conversely, although Apollo, as the Greek god 
  of order and reason, represents a link to the rationalist Enlightenment 
  tradition and thus invites association with neoclassicism, his link to the 
  advancement of civilization aligns him more closely with innovation.</p>
<p>[12] Several of the sub-pairings discussed by Whittall can be related both to 
  A/D and T/I, but they do not necessarily exhibit a 1:1 correlation with both 
  pairings. Civilization-Nature, for example, would seem to correlate with A/D, 
  in that the imposition of order and structure on nature is necessary for the 
  creation of civilization. Yet, when compared to T/I, the relationship is 
  inverted: civilization is affiliated with innovation and progress, while 
  nature represents the unbroken continuity of tradition. To use a musical 
  example, Romanticism (Tonality)-Modernism (Atonality) might seem to map neatly 
  onto both A/D and T/I, until one considers that, at least in its dodecaphonic 
  form, atonal Modernism was more self-consciously ordered and highly structured 
  than the decadent works of late Romanticism. Even at the meta-level (i.e., 
  with regard to music criticism itself), the Structuralism-Hermeneutics 
  division (pages 21, 38) is not clearly analogous to both oppositions; while the 
  order and logic of structuralism aligns it with Apollo, it was nonetheless 
  innovative in the context of nineteenth-century music criticism and formalism.</p>
<p>[13] In his preface, Whittall makes no mention of dialectical relationships, 
  characterizing his oppositions simply as &ldquo;dialogues&rdquo; (page vii) and &ldquo;binary 
  pairings&rdquo; (page viii).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> He is careful to avoid absolutism, however, noting 
  that &ldquo;all these pairs are viewed less as absolute opposites than as 
  interacting, overlapping tendencies, more mobile than fixed&rdquo; (page viii). The 
  best visual analogies for the interaction he mentions appear to be the 
  &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; (pages 17, 28) of a seesaw, the &ldquo;equilibrium&rdquo; (page 17) of a scale, or 
  the &ldquo;continuum&rdquo; (pages 17, 36, 73, <i>passim</i>) of an adjustable slider (e.g., in a 
  graphics editing program). He notes that &ldquo;opposition itself is a relation&rdquo; (page 
  16), and appears eager to avoid the charge of reductionism that might come 
  from invoking the notion of Hegelian synthesis. Instead, he uses terms like 
  &ldquo;polarity&rdquo; (pages 23, 61, 66), &ldquo;tension&rdquo; (pages 49, 61), &ldquo;contrast&rdquo; (page 50), 
  &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; (page 50), and &ldquo;confrontation&rdquo; (page 76), and narrowly defines 
  &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo; as the integrationist compositional goal of modern classicism (pages 
  30, 48, 54).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[14] Thus, it would seem that A/D and T/I are separate but equal influences on 
  twentieth-century compositional aesthetics. As shown in 
<b>Figure 1</b>, a particular 
  composition could be described in relation to the four intersecting spheres of 
  influence. The music of a traditional Apollonian composer would be Classicist, 
  tonal and tightly-knit (e.g., Sibelius) while that of an innovative Apollonian 
  would be Modern-Classicist, atonal, and tightly-knit (e.g., Webern). A 
  traditional Dionysian work, on the other hand, would be Classic-Modernist, 
  tonal but loosely knit (e.g., Jan&aacute;&ccaron;ek), and an innovative one would be 
  Modernist, atonal, and Expressionist (e.g., Berg).</p>
<p>[15] Despite Whittall&rsquo;s assertion that he intends the book to delve &ldquo;deeper 
  into certain aspects of twentieth-century composition than was possible in its 
  more introductory predecessor&rdquo; (page vii), this reviewer would have gladly 
  sacrificed some of the book&rsquo;s breadth for more in-depth analyses, perhaps 
  arranged in alternating chapters as in Robert Hatten&rsquo;s excellent book on 
  musical meaning in Beethoven.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Whittall insists that the book is 
  &ldquo;work-centered,&rdquo; but admits that &ldquo;the quoted music examples can usually only 
  give a hint of the critical and technical perspectives under consideration&rdquo; 
  (page viii). In his defense, however, he has written more extensively on many of 
  the pieces discussed in the book, and points readers to the relevant articles 
  where appropriate. In addition, the absence of prescribed or detailed analytic 
  procedures simultaneously gives the attractive impression that the author is 
  allowing the reader to observe a work in progress (perhaps the second 
  installment of a trilogy, with the concluding work entitled &ldquo;Interpreting 
  Twentieth-Century Music&rdquo;) and inviting the reader to draw his or her own 
  methodological inferences, using the book&rsquo;s aesthetic framework as a guide.<br>
  <br>
  [16] Taken as a whole, Whittall&rsquo;s oppositional framework and the six longer 
  analyses in the latter half of the book&mdash;Chapter 8: Henze&rsquo;s <i>Requiem</i> [1990&ndash;2], 
  Chapter 9: Carter&rsquo;s <i>A Mirror on Which to Dwell</i> [1975] and Birtwistle&rsquo;s
<i>Pulse 
  Shadows</i> [1989&ndash;1996], Chapter 11: Berio&rsquo;s <i>Sequenza XII</i> [1995], Carter&rsquo;s 
<i>Inner 
  Song,</i> and Ligeti&rsquo;s Solo Viola Sonata [1991&ndash;4]&mdash;suggest four analytical 
  implications: </p>
<ol>
  <li>structural analysis ought to be combined with 
  hermeneutics; 
  <li>multiple perspectives ought to be explored and 
  comparative analysis of the work of previous authors undertaken; 
  <li>primary source documents (letters, sketches, etc.) 
  should be consulted; 
  <li>discontinuity and coherence should 
  receive equal weight, with neither aspect receiving &ldquo;a priori&rdquo; preferential 
  treatment. </li>
</ol>
<p>Though these recommendations are not unique to Whittall, they carry 
  greater weight given his compelling demonstration of them in practice 
  throughout the book.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> To illustrate how the first of these recommendations 
  might be applied in the context of a more detailed analysis, this review will 
  conclude with an examination of Act 1, Scene 2 of Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Moses und Aron</i> 
  [1930&ndash;32].</p>
<p>[17] Whittall identifies <i>Moses und Aron</i> as the locus of &ldquo;one of modern music&rsquo;s 
  most archetypal oppositions, that between the speaking Moses and the singing 
  Aron&rdquo; (page 155). This opposition is played out most strongly in Act 1, Scene 2, 
  where Aron meets Moses in the wasteland, argues with him about the possibility 
  of worshipping an unknowable and invisible God, and ultimately rejects Moses&rsquo; 
  command to reveal God to the people without resorting to images or symbols. It 
  is the only scene in which Moses, desperate to win the argument, abandons his 
  <i>Sprechstimme</i> and attempts to beat Aron at his own rhetorical game by singing 
  in full voice. The argument between the two opposing characters&mdash;and Aron&rsquo;s 
  eventual triumph&mdash;is vividly portrayed by Schoenberg in every aspect of the 
  scene&rsquo;s musical structure, from aurally salient features such as register and 
  timbre, to structural features such as areas, row partitions, and 
  voice-leading transformations.</p>
<p>[18] A comparison of the scene&rsquo;s orchestral and vocal features reveals a 
  composite of aural and structural associations that place Moses and Aron in 
  opposition to one another. Moses is associated aurally with low instruments 
  (the trombone, the tuba, and the contrabass), duple meter, low register, loud 
  dynamics, and slow tempi. He is associated structurally with the T<sub>2</sub> 
  transpositional level of the row and its contiguous linear segments, 
  particularly the middle hexachord. Aron, on the other hand, is associated 
  aurally with higher, more lyrical instruments, such as the cello, flute, and 
  violin, triple or irregular meter, high register, quiet dynamics, and faster 
  tempi. Structurally, he is linked to the T<sub>7</sub> transposition of the row and a 
  division of the row into segments based on a selection of every other pitch in 
  its sequence (Cherlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;even/odd&rdquo; partition).</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 2</b>. Row Forms, Partitions, and Areas</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="latham_examples.php?id=3&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 2 thumbnail" src="latham_table2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[19] <b>Table 2</b> lists the areas, row forms, and partitions used by Schoenberg in 
  the scene: the name of an area (e.g., A4) is taken from the transposition of 
  the row form in question (e.g., T<sub>4</sub>).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Area 4, formed by the combination of 
  row forms P<sub>4</sub> and I<sub>7</sub>, opens the scene then disappears after it is presented in 
  Section 2, leaving Area 7 (A7) and Area 2 (A2) in opposition to one another. 
  The ensuing alternation between A2 and A7, beginning in the middle of the 
  &ldquo;Area&rdquo; column of Table 2, reinforces the opposition of Moses and Aron on a 
  structural level. Since A2 is the area in which Moses begins his rebuttal at 
  measure 182, and it is the area in which he sings at measure 208, it becomes strongly 
  associated with him. It also surfaces twice in Section 9, at measures 192 and 200, 
  both times accompanying questions addressed by Moses to God, particularly &ldquo;to 
  whom the reward?&rdquo; Area 7, on the other hand, enters at Aron&rsquo;s first mention of 
  imaging at measure 148. It then becomes the counterpart to the occurrences of A2, 
  accompanying each statement by Aron that is then questioned by Moses.</p>
<p>[20] The introductory Area 4 reappears again in only one place: Section 6, the 
  climactic and pivotal moment of the scene, both textually and musically.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
  The catalytic effect of Section 6 upon the rest of the scene (and the rest of 
  the opera) is well illustrated in Sections 7 through 11, where the rate of 
  area change accelerates to once every three to six measures. This phenomenon, 
  likened by Lewin in his article on the Violin Phantasy to an acceleration of 
  the rate of harmonic change in tonal music, is represented by the proximity of 
  A2 and A7 in the lower half of the &ldquo;Area&rdquo; column. Like any good acceleration, 
  it provides an intensification of the conflict between the two characters, 
  corroborating the idea that Moses and Aron turn increasingly away from each 
  other after Section 6.</p>
<p>[21] Area 4&rsquo;s return highlights Aron&rsquo;s first failure of the scene: measures 
  178&ndash;181, where he attempts to reject the other gods worshipped by the people. 
  Since A4 is associated with Aron&rsquo;s questioning of Moses at the beginning of 
  the scene, it represents uncertainty, and is thus an obvious choice for this 
  point in the scene, when Aron&rsquo;s self-confidence wavers for an instant. In measures 
  183&ndash;207, this moment of hesitation becomes a powerful internal struggle: Aron 
  tries to accept God&rsquo;s intangibility, and, when he finds himself unable to do 
  so, he tries to infuse God with tangible qualities. This struggle, in which 
  Aron goes from hailing God as &ldquo;unimaginable&rdquo; (measures 183&ndash;4) to praising him for 
  the concrete rewards He offers to His people, is represented by the 
  accelerating alternation between A2 and A7. Thus, when Aron sings two 
  consecutive passages in A7 (measures 203&ndash;233), it signals the resolution of the 
  conflict: Aron has resolved that God is made concrete by His actions. When he 
  sings three pitches from A2 in the final measures of the scene, he is speaking 
  with the authority of Moses, appropriating the pitch material that formerly 
  belonged only to him and praying directly to God himself.</p>
<p>[22] Whittall notes that &ldquo;much recent critical discussion [of Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
  late works], like Bluma Goldstein&rsquo;s of <i>Moses und Aron,</i> is more interested in, 
  and more persuasive about the words than the music&rdquo; (page 86). By combining 
  close reading of the musical score with the kind of informed and multivalent 
  critical interpretation advocated by Whittall, music theorists can prevent 
  writing in their field from descending further into jargonized esotericism and 
  restore it to its rightful place alongside the best works of criticism and musicology.</p>
