<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] After many years of performing <i>Clavier-&Uuml;bung III</i>&mdash;Bach&rsquo;s
catechism cycle of chorales which is framed by the opening
Prelude in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and the concluding Fugue in the same key&mdash;my
interest in the deeper underlying issues embodied in the
collection was rekindled upon reading Gregory Butler&rsquo;s
penetrating analysis of its genesis.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  His proof that Bach&rsquo;s
intentions underwent a dramatic change at the engraving stage
(which caused a serious delay in the production and publication),
and his speculation as to some probable musical influences from
Hurlebusch which can be detected in the Prelude and Fugue
movements, led me to ask one simple question:  why?  Why did Bach
change his mind about the work&rsquo;s conception?  And why in
effecting this change did he wish to insert music based
essentially upon the ideas of another composer?
<p>

[2] Despite the late changes, the title page was left unaltered.
Furthermore, Butler has demonstrated not only that it must have
been engraved early on, but also that it must have been the very
first plate engraved for the collection.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Since this page was
left unchanged, whether through expediency or other reason, we
must at least thereby assume that whatever the motive for
changing his mind may have been, Bach&rsquo;s eventual purpose was in
essence no different from what it had originally been:  he
intended, as the title states, to present &ldquo;various preludes on
the catechism and other hymns for the organ.&rdquo;  It is therefore
with Luther&rsquo;s teaching that I wish to begin a further
investigation of Bach&rsquo;s motives as displayed in the final
version.
<p>

[3] The word &ldquo;catechism&rdquo; means &ldquo;instruction manual,&rdquo; and the
usual manner of presentation is in question-and-answer format.
Of Luther&rsquo;s two Catechisms, only the Shorter follows this
structure; the Larger is really a series of sermons and
expositions.  Luther describes the word twice:<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> a) &ldquo;a compend
and brief summary of all the scriptures&rdquo; (Preface to the Larger
Catechism); and b) &ldquo;instruction for children&rdquo; (Preface to the
Shorter Catechism).  Bach&rsquo;s collection of catechism pieces could
therefore be viewed on two concurrent levels:  a) as a collection
of musical items for &ldquo;ad libitum&rdquo; use in Luther&rsquo;s liturgy; and b)
as a didactic cycle reflecting salient aspects of Luther&rsquo;s own
meditations upon this.  Thus, not only has Bach provided
interesting chorale settings that bear upon the liturgy which
Luther outlined, and with which they can be used &ldquo;ad libitum&rdquo; to
enhance its realization, but also his structural plan has
reflected&mdash;in its provision of longer and shorter settings&mdash;the
two respective catechisms themselves.
<p>

[4] A catechism is, however, entirely instructional:  it does no
more than provide an explanation of, and authority for, the
believer&rsquo;s faith and its necessary means of expression.  In
Luther&rsquo;s catechism, moreover, there is an extra dimension of
importance:  a dissatisfaction with purely orthodox tenets, and
an affirmation of a reformed mode of thought.  This places as
much emphasis upon the <i>spirit</i> as upon the letter of the law.
<p>

[5] The possibility that Bach&rsquo;s agenda in <i>Clavier-&Uuml;bung III</i> was
to embody in his musical expression not only the letter but also
the spirit of Luther&rsquo;s writings makes it worth examining further
those movements which were added at a later stage.  In particular
the opening Prelude and concluding Fugue, neither of which bears
any clear external relationship with Luther&rsquo;s teaching, are prime
candidates for review.  I hope to demonstrate that both
movements, despite their format, are linked both inspirationally
and musically to a common chorale source; and that this chorale
itself was reflective of a tangible Lutheran premise which had
acquired a prominent position in Luther&rsquo;s Larger Catechism.
<p>

[6] Such a proposal will need to establish the three attributes
of all serious litigation:  means, motive and opportunity.
Should all three be deemed satisfactory, it will then further be
necessary to provide explicit and corroborative evidence&mdash;via
analytic means&mdash;in order to arrive at a successful verdict.
This essay will therefore proceed under the following headings:
Means, Motive, Opportunity, Evidence.</p>

<p>

[7] MEANS:  Although the basing of a Prelude and Fugue on a
chorale may seem fanciful, there is at least the evidence that
fughettas utilized this procedure.  A particularly salient
example is the fughetta on <i>Allein Gott</i> (BWV 677) from
<i>Clavier &Uuml;bung III</i>.  Examination reveals that the designated
chorale lies buried within the subject and its extension, and
that the second phrase of the melody is treated in a similar
manner (see <b>Example 1</b>).
</p>


<p>

[8] The particular pertinence of this example lies not so much in
its origin in <i>Clavier &Uuml;bung III</i> as in its close musical
association with the Fugue in C Major (BWV 547) whose opening can
scarcely be viewed as anything less than a conscious elaboration
of the same material (see <b>Example 2</b>).
</p>


<p>

[9] With this parallel, it is difficult to believe that Bach&rsquo;s
association of the chorale with the fughetta would not have been
matched by a similar connection with the fugue.  The former is a
clear designation, while the latter is an elaborate expansion of
the very same material.  Looking now at the Prelude in C&mdash;the
fugue&rsquo;s companion&mdash;is there further evidence of a material
connection with the chorale?  <b>Example 3</b> may afford some insight:
</p>

<p>
[10] These affinities between the Prelude and the chorale are
maintained throughout the movement, although the association is
rhapsodic rather than schematic.  The Prelude here develops its
own free-standing motivic content; but the origin of these motifs
bears more than a passing reference to the chorale.  The means to
incorporate chorale-derived material into Preludes and Fugues
seems, on the basis of Examples 2 and 3, credible as opposed to
merely fanciful.
<p>

[11] MOTIVE:  Certain aspects of Luther&rsquo;s catechism are
innovatory and significant.  In particular may be mentioned his
teaching of the Creed in Part 2 of the Larger Catechism where he
rationalized the twelve Articles of the Creed into three
&ldquo;according to the three persons of the Trinity&rdquo;:  God the Father
(creation), God the Son (redemption), and God the Holy Ghost
(sanctification).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> This is not merely a structural
simplification of pre-existing dogma, but a theological
rationalization of Belief and its essential attributes.  Bach&rsquo;s
desire to express this in the structure and design of the cycle,
and especially within its concluding fugue, also indicates his
interest in the doctrinal foundations and theological concepts
which Luther&rsquo;s instruction manuals sought to illuminate.
<p>

[12] But Luther&rsquo;s discussion of the Creed was only subsequent to
his exposition of the Ten Commandments; it was his view that
before we could genuinely state our beliefs, we had to understand
the Law:  &ldquo;Thus far we have heard the first part of Christian
doctrine (i.e.  the Ten Commandments), in which we have seen all
that God wishes us to do or to leave undone.  Now, there properly
follows the Creed, which sets forth to us everything that we must
expect and receive from God<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;
<p>

[13] In his conclusion to the Creed, Luther sought to contrast
its nature with that of the Ten Commandments:  &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>the Ten
Commandments are written in the hearts of all men; the Creed,
however, no human wisdom can comprehend, but it must be taught by
the Holy Ghost alone.&rdquo;  This allusion to &ldquo;the heart&rdquo; is of great
importance to Luther&rsquo;s view of the Commandments, and man&rsquo;s
adherence to them.  Indeed, his conclusion to Part I (Ten
Commandments) states the following:  &ldquo;Thus He demands that all
our works proceed from a heart which fears and regards God
alone<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;  Luther saw &ldquo;the heart&rdquo; as being axiomatic to his new
philosophy of our interaction with God, for in Article III on The
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer he stated:  &ldquo;And if we would assemble all the
churches, together with all ecclesiastics, they would be obliged
to confess that they never from the heart prayed for even a drop
of wine.&rdquo;
<p>

[14] References to &ldquo;the heart&rdquo; in Luther&rsquo;s commentary on the Ten
Commandments (Larger Catechism Part I) are too frequent to
enumerate here without tedium; but a few selected examples will,
hopefully, serve to illustrate this crucial attribute of correct
observance required by Luther:
<p>
<ul>

i) &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>to have a God is nothing else that to trust and believe
him from the whole heart; as I have often said that the
confidence and faith of the heart alone make both God and an
idol.&rdquo;  (First Commandment)
<p>

ii) &ldquo;As the First Commandment has instructed the heart and taught
faith, so this commandment leads us forth and directs the mouth
and tongue of God.&rdquo;  (Second Commandment)
<p>

iii) (Speaking of the training of children) &ldquo;But this manner of
training so spreads its roots in the heart that they fear God
more than rods and clubs.&rdquo;  (Conclusion to the Second
Commandment)
<p>

iv) &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>but, most of all that both in heart and with body we so
act as to show that we esteem them (i.e.  the parents) very
highly.&rdquo;  (Fourth Commandment)
<p>

v) &ldquo;When we see such people (i.e.  our enemies), our hearts, in
turn, could rage and bleed and take vengeance.&rdquo;  (Fifth
Commandment)
<p>

vi) &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>and not only is the external act (i.e.  of adultery)
forbidden, but also every kind of cause, incitement, and means,
so that the heart, the lips and the whole body may be chaste<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;
(Sixth Commandment)
<p>
</ul>

<p>[15] Thus the Creed, where we acknowledge our belief in the gifts
of the three persons of the Trinity, is only a corollary to an
adherence to the Ten Commandments which are written (not just on
stone tablets but) in our hearts:  while prayers and beliefs are
spoken with the lips, they must originate from the heart.
<p>

[16] OPPORTUNITY:  If Bach had wished to capture Luther&rsquo;s
emphasis on &ldquo;the heart,&rdquo; he would probably have done so by
allusion.  An unambiguous homage to this emphasis could, for
example, be paid by presenting a composition&mdash;integral to the
overall scheme&mdash;which has strong and clear affinities with &ldquo;the
heart&rdquo; in the minds and ears of those studying or hearing the
piece.  Such an opportunity would be presented by a chorale,
well-known to congregations of the time, which focussed in some
way upon this very aspect.  If they recognized the use of the
chorale melody, either through musical quotation or borrowing,
they would also call to mind the appropriate text associated with
this melody.
<p>

[17] One clear opportunity, with appropriate associations, is the
chorale <i>O Herzens Angst, O Bangigkeit</i>.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> The fact that the
version which has come down to us, with Bach&rsquo;s own harmonization,
uses the same key as the Fugue is less important than two other
features:  a) its text<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> presents a clear link with the heart, and b) its first four notes are identical with those of the main
fugue subject.  Whether this instant but initially superficial
connection will lead to a more tangible inbuilt association
between the two must now be discovered by examining, through
analytic means, the evidence.
<p>

[18] EVIDENCE:  The fughetta on <i>Allein Gott</i> earlier showed how
Bach, in assimilating a chorale melody into a fugal texture,
embroidered its main notes into a highly-decorated new theme.  It
also showed that, unlike in the more formal, designated, chorale
settings, the treatment of the model is freer in nature so as to
allow the motivic content of the new piece <i>per se</i> to develop
along its own lines as is customary in fugues (whether on a small
or large scale).  But the very title of the fughetta compels an
acceptance of the presence of the melody, and a simple analysis
of the structure reveals how this is used.  The main difference
between this fughetta and the larger Fugue in C (BWV 547) is,
then, that our perception of this relationship in the former is
initially and primarily external (i.e.  it is designated in the
title), and that we are then inexorably led to explore how this
relationship has been internalized through the music.  With the
Fugue in C there is no external connection; the clear internal
relationship with the fughetta does, however, strongly impute a
corresponding internal relationship with the same chorale.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Any evidence pertaining to the Fugue in E Flat must, therefore,
be purely internal:  the starting point does not arise from
external evidence provided by the composer, but rather from the
circumstantial evidence deduced earlier with regard to means,
motive and opportunity.
<p>

[19] The fugue subject itself is not one of striking innovation:
a very similar one can be found in the organ works of
Buxtehude,<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> and a case was recently argued in favour of a
direct link with Hurlebusch&rsquo;s <i>Compositioni Musicali</i>
(specifically the fugue number 4 of his <i>Parte Seconda</i>).<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> While it is important to reveal such likenesses, it is no less
crucial to demonstrate other impulses which seem to have&mdash;as I
would argue in this instance&mdash;a clear conceptual relevance to
the whole cycle (of which this fugue is but one important
member).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> In this respect, I hope to show that Bach&rsquo;s example
contained far more musical, theological, and spiritual resonance
than all the other examples put together.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>

<p>

[20] The text of <i>O Herzens Angst</i> strikes a number of resonances
with Luther&rsquo;s Larger Catechism, not least with regard to
admonitions contained in his commentary on the First Commandment.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
Those unequivocal Lutheran axioms evidence just how strongly
a Lutheran heart must experience both love and fear.  This
chorale is illustrated in <b>Example 4</b>, together with the surviving
text:
</p>

<p>

[21] Upon examination, the opening of the E-Flat Fugue displays a
clear similarity with the beginning of the chorale; what may
not be so evident, however, is that the countersubject of the
fugue also shows a strong resemblance to the second phrase of the
chorale.  But in both themes there are extra notes:  the subject
is provided with a cadence figure in measure 2,<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> while the
countersubject provides added pitches at the end of its first
measure in order to retain movement and harmonic integrity with
the answer.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The various correlations between the fugue&rsquo;s
beginning and the chorale melody are illustrated in <b>Example 5</b>:
</p>

<p>

[22] The opening of the fugue&rsquo;s second section (measure 37)
presents what initially appears to be a new subject:  but closer
examination reveals that it is nothing other than an elaborate
variant of the original countersubject (see Example 5, measures
3&ndash;4, relating with the chorale&rsquo;s second phrase).  So far,
therefore, it can be seen (even supposing this to have been
purely subconscious on Bach&rsquo;s part) that the fugue employs, in
its first section, material closely related with the first two
phrases of the chorale.  If, however, one were to discover, as
the fugue progresses, further references to the chorale melody
articulated in a definite and schematic manner, this would begin
to suggest that the composer was not operating only on a
subconscious level but consciously deriving essential structural
features from the chorale.  <b>Example 6</b> shows the opening of
section 2, and the accompanying line supplied from the chorale&rsquo;s
second, third and fourth phrases:
</p>

<p>

[23] That this new subject should correlate with phrase 2 of the
chorale is fairly inevitable since it is a variant of the first
countersubject (which also follows the contours and main pitches
of the chorale); but there can surely be nothing coincidental in
its continuation not only ghosting phrase three but also phrase
four of the chorale.  As we know very well, measure 59 will
herald the return of the first fugue subject at its original
pitch (to be combined then with the new subject), and this will
thereby recall phrase 1 of the chorale (together with its cadence
figure which ghosts the final chorale phrase).<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> So far,
therefore, section two of the fugue has shown a relationship with
phrases two, three and four of the chorale melody, and this has
followed a simple presentational scheme whereby within only five
measures almost half the entire model has been quoted.  When the
fugue&rsquo;s original main theme returns at measure 59, this section
will then have quoted from the first four of the chorale&rsquo;s six
phrases.</p>


<p>

[24] As the second section of the fugue moves to its close (by
measure 82), its tonality begins to veer in the same direction as
phrase five of the chorale:  it moves from B Flat Major (measure
59, pinpointed in structure by the first return of the original
theme) to C Minor (measure 82) where a firm cadence is
established.  Since, however, it seems that Bach has not quoted
directly from the melody of phrase five,<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> any supposed
allusions will not strictly satisfy the forensic criteria
stipulated in this essay.  Measures 75 to 82 are packed with
sophistication involving the returned original main theme, and
variants of the new main theme in both rectus and inversus
positions.  In this pregnant outpouring of technical skill, in
which the music is carefully pushed towards the C Minor goal, it
is nonetheless possible to hear a number of musical references,
even though they can at best be regarded as only &ldquo;circumstantial&rdquo;
in nature.  These are illustrated in <b>Example 7</b>.
</p>

<p>

[25] At measure 82, the fugue moves effortlessly and without a
break into its third and final section.  A new, third subject
emerges from within the cadence, beginning with the notes C&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;C.
These are also the same notes that are found in the chorale as it
moves from its C Minor cadence into the sixth and final
phrase.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup><p>

[26] In conception, the external plan of the fugue is
transparent; but I have argued that there is also an internal
plan which links it to a particular chorale.  This connection
arises not because of the visually obvious fact that each
composition begins with the same four notes; viewed merely on
this level, the true plan remains invisible.  Only by making an
important connection with Bach&rsquo;s Lutheran outlook&mdash;one that
intersects also with the text of this particular chorale&mdash;is one
led beyond these four notes to perceive the extent to which these
two pieces musically interact.  This connection&mdash;the imagery of
&ldquo;the heart&rdquo;&mdash;may possibly suggest a reason as to why Bach
remained cautious and tardy about his final, published conception
of the work, even well into its period of engraving.  Perhaps he
considered at the last moment that an important spiritual aspect
of Luther&rsquo;s teaching had not at that stage found an adequate
formal means of expression within the scheme proposed.
<p>

[27] As Gregory Butler has conclusively proved,<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> the opening
Prelude in E Flat was added after the engraving of the collection
had been begun; but why?  Was there also an internal agenda for
this movement?  And if so, did it follow that which appears in
the fugue?  Indeed, is there any direct musical connection
between the two movements (over and above the purely superficial
one of key)?
<p>

[28] Butler has argued in favour of a link between the Prelude in
E Flat and the <i>Overture</i> of the <i>Parte Seconda</i> in Hurlebusch&rsquo;s
<i>Compositioni Musicali</i>.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> While, again, we see Bach&rsquo;s
monumental musical conception set against Hurlebusch&rsquo;s more
modest accomplishment, a similarity of style cannot be denied;
but these purely external attributes, again, do not necessarily
explain what has been internalized or implanted beneath the
surface detail.  While no definite musical link has yet been
posited for the two Hurlebusch movements (other than their being
separate items within the same collection), I would argue that
there certainly is internally a unifying musical (and
philosophical) link between Bach&rsquo;s two movements.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>

[29] Most modern editions of the Prelude in E Flat transmit the
music on three staves for ease of performance.  This presentation
obscures what I believe is an important structural element in the
opening 7 measures:  an element that becomes transparent when the
original print, which uses only two staves, is viewed.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> There,
an important melody in the left hand is laid bare for all to see,
as shown in <b>Example 8</b>.
</p>

<p>

[30] This melody has at least a clear visual connection with the
first theme of the concluding fugue.  Aurally, it is less obvious
because a) the rhythmic scheme of the opening requires note
repetition, and b) the ear is directed more to the Prelude&rsquo;s main
theme in the right hand.  Other connections can be perceived,
albeit with only varying degrees of forensic corroboration,
between the Prelude and the chorale melody.
<p>

[31] Like the chorale, the opening ritornello follows a simple
harmonic plan:  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;C minor&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>.  In the chorale, the move from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> to C minor is effected melodically by the distinctive rising
chromaticism of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;C.  In the Prelude (measures 17&ndash;20) the same line is found in the bass.</p>

<p>

[32] More importantly, however, the second ritornello (measures
51&ndash;71) reaches its final cadence in C minor, and the continuing
&ldquo;solo&rdquo; material now places an emphasis upon what appears to be a
new theme:  one that recurs with considerable development later
in the piece.  This new theme has very close links with phrase 4
of the chorale:  it occurs in both principal contrapuntal lines.
After extensive development through diverse keys, it eventually
returns in C minor (measure 169) to close the final &ldquo;solo&rdquo;
section.  Measures 71&ndash;5 are shown in <b>Example 9</b>.
</p>

<p>

[33] CONCLUSION:  Bach was hesitant about the final form of
<i>Clavier &Uuml;bung III</i>:  this was either because he was dissatisfied
with the quality of some of the music he had written, or because
he became skeptical about the presentation and format as
originally conceived.  Since Butler has proved that the changes
largely involved the addition rather than the removal of
material, the latter reason seems the more likely.  The only
explanation for wishing to enlarge the collection&mdash;which
decision caused enormous problems with the scheduled production
and publication dates&mdash;must be the way in which Bach viewed his
success in having fulfilled the overall objective:  one of
providing musical items reflecting Luther&rsquo;s Catechism.  It is
easy for such a scheme to follow the letter of the law (i.e.
through the provision of settings of the Ten Commandments, the
Creed, and the Sacraments), but not so easy for it to capture the
<i>spirit</i>.  Luther&rsquo;s teaching stands apart by virtue of its clear
insistence that The Law must embody a human experience &ldquo;from the
heart.&rdquo;  All such experience, whether painful or pleasurable,
needs this essential attribute.
<p>

[34] The opportunity for Bach to capture this nuance arose, I
would argue, through the existence of a chorale whose text lent
an appropriate emphasis for a composer able to seize upon the
musical elements associated with this.
<p>

[35] The means of utilizing such musical elements within the
framework of a Prelude and Fugue already existed through the
technique currently used in embedding chorale melodies within
fugal textures (e.g.  in the designated chorale-fughuettas and
fugues), and in the establishment of thematic links between
Prelude and Fugue.
<p>

[36] The motive presents itself in Bach&rsquo;s wish (after a period of
re-think and procrastination) to capture not only the letter but
also the spirit of Luther&rsquo;s teaching as transmitted through his
catechisms.  Luther required observance of the law to be &ldquo;from
the heart&rdquo;; and I have argued that this special and significant
attribute was conveyed by Bach in opening and closing movements
which, through their clear spiritual resonances, provided a
fitting envelope for a collection of music inspired by Luther&rsquo;s
catechism.</p>

Hurlebusch and Bach compositions (including important historical
facts providing evidence that Bach was acquainted with his music)
is interesting and informative.  However, Hurlebusch&rsquo;s piece,
despite its <i>alla breve</i> notation, seems stylistically more akin
with the E-Major fugue of Buxtehude.  The similarities extend
beyond the subject (the second half of which is almost identical
in both cases, though radically different in the Bach):  although
Hurlebusch at least surpassed Buxtehude in realizing the
possibility of simple stretto (Buxtehude merely hinting at the
possibility once in measures 31&ndash;2), the structure of his
exposition is somewhat loose compared with Bach&rsquo;s.  In
Hurlebusch, not only does the second voice announce a statement
of the theme again in the tonic (rather than the dominant), but
the composer cannot withhold the temptation of using stretto as
early as measure 7.  Bach leaves it until measure 21 where the
device marks off a structural point in the first section of his
fugue.  This contrast alone, while not negating the proposed link
with Hurlebusch, does point to fundamental differences in the
respective concepts of overall structure and scale.  Further,
Bach (unlike either Hurlebusch or Buxtehude) alters the pitch of
note 4 in the answer; this idea was not influenced by either of
the other composers, but stems from the salient importance of his
countersubject (which I will demonstrate presently).<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> Nothing in this essay seeks to challenge Butler&rsquo;s findings

carried?  Whose tomb is this?  What is the name of the rock?  I
should know it!&rdquo;  Luther made it clear in his teaching on the
First Commandment that man should both love and fear God.  He
wrote in the Exposition of the Appendix to the First Commandment:
&ldquo;Learn, therefore, from these words how angry God is with those
who trust in anything but Him, and again, how good and gracious
He is to those who trust and believe in Him alone with the whole
heart<nobr>. . .</nobr> He is a God who will not leave it unavenged if men turn
from Him<nobr>. . .</nobr>even until they are utterly exterminated.  Therefore
He is to be feared, and not to be desisted.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> This matches&mdash;interestingly&mdash;the final cadence of the
chorale melody.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> The countersubject is (despite appearances) not a regular

taken from F. Bente and W. H. T. Dau, <i>Triglot Concordia:
The Symbolic Books of the Ev.  Lutheran Church</i>  (St. Louis:
Concordia Publishing House 1921).  These texts are in the public

therefore also three articles or confessions.&rdquo;  The trinitarian
aspects of <i>Clavier-&Uuml;bung III</i> (seen in the number of movements,
the tripartite design of the fugue, its number of entries of the
subject, and its signature of three flats) seem to mirror
Luther&rsquo;s view that belief, and its expression in the Creed, is in
essence symbolic of, and derivative from, the Trinity.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">See Albert Riemenschneider, <i>371 Harmonized Chorales and 69
Chorale Melodies</i> (New York/London:  Schirmer 1941), no. 173.
No J. S.  Bach source survives for this chorale, though it
appeared in C.P.E.  Bach&rsquo;s edition of the chorales, vol.  2,
published by Breitkopf in 1785.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">See Carl von Winterfeld, <i>Der Evangelische Kirkengesang
III</i> (Leipzig:  1847; reprint ed., Hildesheim:  Olms 1966, 
287, where the text is attributed to Christi Begraebniss).  No texts
were transmitted by C.P.E. Bach.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">It would be difficult to maintain that Bach, even if <i>Allein
Gott</i> could not have been further from his mind when he started
work on the Fugue in C, did not at least become aware of the
musical connotation as his work proceeded, especially as the
material he used was almost identical to another piece where he
provided a clear external link.  The further evidence internal to
the accompanying Prelude in C can only serve to strengthen this
assumption.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">See the Prelude and Fugue in E Major in Hedar, Josef,
<i>Dietrich Buxtehude, Saemtliche Orgelwerke, Band II</i> (Copenhagen:
Hansen 1952), 80.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Butler, 5.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Butler&rsquo;s study of certain similarities between the
Hurlebusch and Bach compositions (including important historical
facts providing evidence that Bach was acquainted with his music)
is interesting and informative.  However, Hurlebusch&rsquo;s piece,
despite its <i>alla breve</i> notation, seems stylistically more akin
with the E-Major fugue of Buxtehude.  The similarities extend
beyond the subject (the second half of which is almost identical
in both cases, though radically different in the Bach):  although
Hurlebusch at least surpassed Buxtehude in realizing the
possibility of simple stretto (Buxtehude merely hinting at the
possibility once in measures 31&ndash;2), the structure of his
exposition is somewhat loose compared with Bach&rsquo;s.  In
Hurlebusch, not only does the second voice announce a statement
of the theme again in the tonic (rather than the dominant), but
the composer cannot withhold the temptation of using stretto as
early as measure 7.  Bach leaves it until measure 21 where the
device marks off a structural point in the first section of his
fugue.  This contrast alone, while not negating the proposed link
with Hurlebusch, does point to fundamental differences in the
respective concepts of overall structure and scale.  Further,
Bach (unlike either Hurlebusch or Buxtehude) alters the pitch of
note 4 in the answer; this idea was not influenced by either of
the other composers, but stems from the salient importance of his
countersubject (which I will demonstrate presently).</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Nothing in this essay seeks to challenge Butler&rsquo;s findings
with regard to the genesis of <i>Claver-&Uuml;bung III</i>.  It may,
however, provide a possible reason as to why Bach changed his
view of the work&rsquo;s overall design even after engraving had begun.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">The chorale text may be translated as follows:  &ldquo;O fear of
the heart, O anxiety and hesitation!  Whose body do I see being
carried?  Whose tomb is this?  What is the name of the rock?  I
should know it!&rdquo;  Luther made it clear in his teaching on the
First Commandment that man should both love and fear God.  He
wrote in the Exposition of the Appendix to the First Commandment:
&ldquo;Learn, therefore, from these words how angry God is with those
who trust in anything but Him, and again, how good and gracious
He is to those who trust and believe in Him alone with the whole
heart. . . He is a God who will not leave it unavenged if men turn
from Him. . .even until they are utterly exterminated.  Therefore
He is to be feared, and not to be desisted.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">This matches&mdash;interestingly&mdash;the final cadence of the
chorale melody.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">The countersubject is (despite appearances) not a regular
one:  its first statement is crucial to the unfolding of
material, so much so that Bach is happy to alter the pitch of
note 4 in the answer.  This alteration also occurs in measure 10
when this countersubject (with one minor change of pitch)
reappears.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">This will be the first time when the cumulative structure of
the whole fugue can be perceived:  the old theme returning to
combine with the new also happens in the third section.  This
will identify the original subject as, indeed, the overriding
&ldquo;main&rdquo; theme.  Its association with the words &ldquo;O Herzens Angst&rdquo;
will therefore be an ever-recurring one throughout the piece.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">This is because his idea for this section is to show the new
subject both in its rectus and inversus forms.  It was argued
above that even where fughettas bear chorale designations in the
