<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1.1] Rhythm and meter are difficult to theorize&#151;not only to formalize
but also simply to discuss&#151;because of their elusive and variegated
nature.  For twenty years Christopher Hasty has explored fundamental
questions about musical time.  In a series of important articles in the
1980&#146;s,<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> he developed some conceptually and analytically productive
ways to conceive of temporal processes in music.  Although the topics of
his articles were not explicitly linked, one would naturally expect a
book-length study to follow.</p>

<p>
[1.2] After a decade of suspenseful silence, the anticipated book has indeed
appeared.  Its processive perspective is familiar from the earlier
articles, but its topic, the music it discusses, and its grounding in
philosophy, psychology, and music theory are fresh.  For the importance of
its subject, for the quality, consistency, and depth of its theoretical
insight, and for the wisdom and clarity of its exposition, <i>Meter as
Rhythm</i>  should be read and appreciated.  It requires a willingness to
engage with seemingly small musical details, with diverse musics, and with
a speculative, philosophical mode of exposition, but the reader&#146;s
persistent efforts will be well rewarded.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>2. A New View of Meter as Projection</b></p>


<p>
[2.1] Many modern conceptions of rhythm and meter place them in opposition.
Rhythm is often defined to consist of the actually sounding durations of
music, while meter is the alternation of strong and weak beats, or the
interaction of pulse strata, that are inferred from the rhythm.  Rhythm is
thus conceived as emerging and active&#151; a &ldquo;concrete&rdquo;
patterning that is measured by, and heard to work with or against the
&ldquo;abstract,&rdquo; deterministic, rigid metrical grid.  These
contrasting conceptions are ingrained deeply into much theorizing and into
most practical communication about rhythm.</p>

<p>
[2.2] Hasty problematizes this opposition on both perceptual and logical
grounds.  As an alternative, he defines meter simply, without reference to
accent or pulse, as the potential of a duration to be immediately
reproduced.  This potential arises in connection with sensations that we
gather about events as they &ldquo;become,&rdquo; or unfold in time.  To describe meter
from the perspective of an active listener, Hasty appropriates concepts and
terminology from Alfred North Whitehead&#146;s <i>Process and Reality</i>.
From this perspective, he says, meter is &ldquo;a process in which the
determinacy of the past is molded to the demands of the emerging novelty of
the present.&rdquo; (168).  It is thus &ldquo;rhythmic&rdquo; in the sense
that it, too, is emerging, active, creative and perpetually novel.</p>

<p>
[2.3] The essence of meter, in Hasty&#146;s theory, is the process of
&ldquo;projection.&rdquo;  Specifically, as an event becomes, its duration
accumulates &ldquo;projective potential,&rdquo; or the potential to condition
our expectations about the duration of future events.  In the simplest
case, the duration&#146;s projective potential is &ldquo;realized&rdquo; when
&ldquo;there is a new beginning whose durational potential is determined by
the now past first event.&rdquo;  We perceive this realization when we
project that the second event will replicate the duration that it makes
past.<i> </i> The second event&#146;s duration may or may not actually
realize this projection, and the parity or disparity that is manifest at
its end (at the beginning of a third event) corresponds to musical
perceptions of &ldquo;too short&rdquo; or &ldquo;too long&rdquo; that may be
expressively and analytically significant.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="roeder_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="roeder_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>
[2.4] Hasty illustrates metrical projection with graphical diagrams that (he
ruefully notes) necessarily rely on the very spatial metaphors that he is
striving to avoid.  To gain a better understanding, and a more truly
temporal representation of the nature of projection, please examine the
Java applet in <b>Example 1</b>.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  It allows
the user to determine, in sequence, the beginnings and ends of three line
segments, representing events, and to examine the resulting projections and
other metrical effects, such as speeding up, slowing down, and hiatus.
Click the mouse to define the beginning of the event, then move the mouse
to the right to define the duration of the event, then click to end the
event.  Up to three events of any length may be so determined; however, to
keep the demonstration focused on Hasty&#146;s theory, the applet will not
permit the user to define events that do not involve metrical projections.
The scale of time in the example is calibrated by a constant
&ldquo;Lim&rdquo; signifying the maximum duration that can be projective,
which Hasty speculates to be about two seconds in this highly simplified
monophonic texture.  Try defining events of various lengths, and observe
how the projections accumulate, disappear, and changes accordingly, as
explained in the running commentary.  (I&rsquo;m sorry that the current version
of the Java programming language does not offer a practical method for
playing the sound sequences.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>3. Consequences for Metrical Theory</b></p>

<p>
[3.1] Although the concept of projection is simple, Hasty uses it to develop
detailed and enlightening readings of durational patterns.  His readings
address many fundamental musical issues, for example: the metrical nature
of beginning, ending, and continuation; the differences among various
patterns ostensibly having the &ldquo;same&rdquo; meter; and metrical effects
that have been observed by many other analysts.</p>

<p>
[3.2] Chapter 9 reworks some traditional conceptions of meter in terms of
projection.  Metrical accent is defined as &ldquo;the accent of
beginning&rdquo;; this resembles Jonathan Kramer&#146;s definition (<i>The
Time of Music</i>, Schirmer, 1988, p. 86), but has substantive differences.
&ldquo;Beginning&rdquo; itself is a function that is determined
processively&#151;that is, the function of beginning is only perceived as a
duration that is begun becomes.  The significance of a beginning depends on
whether the duration of interest is that of a single event, or of a
harmony, or of a series of associated successive durations.  In the last
case, the later durations in the series contribute to the continuation of
the duration of the whole group.  </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="roeder_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="roeder_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>
[3.3] Accordingly the distinction between strong and weak (metrical) accent is
replaced with a functional distinction between beginning and continuation,
as shown in <b>Example 2</b> (Hasty&#146;s 9.2). 

<p>
Each small vertical
stroke above a note head symbolizes not a beat but to the
&ldquo;becoming&rdquo; of the entire mensurally determinate duration that is
begun by the attack of the note.  The larger vertical stroke over the first
notehead refers to the becoming of entire duration of two quarter notes;
because the half note duration is continued through a series of briefer
durations, its onset is called a &ldquo;dominant beginning.&rdquo;  The
slanted stroke over the second notehead indicates that, even while its
duration begins, the earlier beginning (of the two-note group) is still
actively becoming, so the second event&#146;s becoming is a
&ldquo;continuation&rdquo; of that  duration. </p>

<p>
[3.4] The functions of beginning and continuation are not immutable.  They may
be reassessed as later events modify the listener&#146;s sense of what has
begun.  For instance, anacrusis is understood in this context as a
continuation that becomes &ldquo;detached&rdquo; from a beginning.</p>

<p>
[3.5] Hasty first employs the concepts of projection, beginning and
continuation to analyze the meter of common brief durational patterns.  The
analyses show how patterns with the same meter signature are actually quite
different in projective action.  They also permit some original and
interesting distinctions, such as between acceleration and increased
activity of division.  Other effects, such as &ldquo;silent beginning,&rdquo;
are also explained as results of projection.</p>

<p>
[3.6] Since meter entails the projected reproduction of a duration, duple
meter is privileged in the theory.  (Indeed the duple bias is reflected
frankly in the two-column layout of the book&#146;s text.)  Triple meter
can nevertheless be explained, however, in the manner shown in Example 3
(Hasty&#146;s 9.18f).  

<p>
This shows a half-note
projection Q, corresponding to a potential duple meter, that is denied by
events starting at the asterisk that favor (say, by motivic repetition) a
dotted-half projection R.  The third quarter note in this situation is then
regarded as a &ldquo;deferral&rdquo;&#150;it functions to delay the next
dominant beginning.  More complex meters are also analyzed in similar
terms.</p>

<p>
[3.7] The traditional terms &ldquo;beat&rdquo; and &ldquo;measure&rdquo; take on
novel connotations in this context.  A &ldquo;beat&rdquo; is a
beginning&#151;not a time point, but a function that is evaluated as the
event becomes. &ldquo;Beats&rdquo; need not recur at equal time intervals:
&ldquo;the flexibility of mensural determinacy frees projective activity
from the narrow confines of &#145;precise&#146; equality&rdquo; (277).
&ldquo;Measure&rdquo; refers not to the notated bar, but to any duration that
is mensurally determinate. Any projection is therefore a
&ldquo;measure.&rdquo;  Measures &ldquo;are not given&#151;they are created
under the pressure of antecedent events and are creative for present and
future events.&rdquo; A given passage of music may present a polyphony of
&ldquo;measures,&rdquo; some reinforcing regular meter, and others possibly
acting against it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>4. Analytical Applications</b></p>

<p>
[4.1] Chapter 10 initiates a move from the general to the particular by
applying the theory in analysis. Meter, as projection, is always specific
to the given musical context. For example, Hasty demonstrates, identical
durational patterns may have different metrical interpretations depending
on their pitches and tempi.</p>

<p>
[4.2] Analyzing the meter of a musical passage in these terms entails
identifying its projections, and distinguishing beginnings, continuations,
and anacruses at the beat and measure level.  The theory allows one to
explain how, in many cases, the basic projection-functions are modified
subtly and richly by denials, overlappings, and contractions.  A complete
analysis thus explains the continuity or discontinuity in a passage,
locates certain common types of projections that execute such formal
functions as closure, and identifies certain common metrical processes such
as the &ldquo;contraction of projective focus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
[4.3] The emphasis on beat and measure does not preclude a consideration of
longer excerpts.  A whole chapter is devoted to examining how
projection&#151;which is perceived only in relatively brief time spans up
to a few seconds&#151;may be &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; over larger time spans
by means of grouping parallelisms and mutually reinforcing briefer
projections.  Indeed, in the analyses of common-practice tonal music, the
focus is not so much the smaller patterns (which generally accord with the
notated meter signature) but on the varieties of larger-scale
&ldquo;hypermetrical&rdquo; contractions and elisions, and their effect onmus
ical continuity.  To further clarify how he regards this
&ldquo;simulated&rdquo; meter, Hasty compares his readings to 
Schenkerian-oriented analyses by Schachter and Rothstein.</p>

<p>
[4.4] One of the most impressive aspects of the book is the variety of music
that is analyzed.  The tonal works analyzed in depth include the first
movement of Beethoven&#146;s First Symphony and the Trio of Mozart&#146;s
Symphony No. 35.  But there are also quite convincing accounts of meter in
non-tonal modernist music by Wolpe and Carter, showing what thwarts
larger-scale projections, and explaining how various denials and deferrals
of dominant beginnings facilitate continuity and the sustaining of energy.
With reference to the Webern Saxophone Quartet Hasty explains how hiatus
contributes to the creation of a &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; built of successive
projective &ldquo;consituents,&rdquo; each of which possesses varying degrees
of openness or closure.  He also provides detailed and exciting readings of
vocal polyphony by Monteverdi and Sch&uuml;tz, readings that convincingly
connect the observed metrical effects to the syntax and semantics of the
poetry.  No one has succeeded better in expressing verbally the rhythmic
nature of these musics.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>5. Strengths, Evidences, and a Few Weaknesses</b></p>

<p>
[5.1] Hasty&#146;s theory verges on the systematic, even on the programmable,
as Example 1 begins to demonstrate, but he constantly eschews the
temptation and dangers of system building.  He is frank about the
speculative nature of his concepts, and very clear about the intensely
personal nature of hearing rhythm and meter.  It seems that he is less
interested in providing a basis for &ldquo;verifiable&rdquo; analyses
(however that quality might be defined) than he is in provided a clear
language for discussing musicians&#146; possibly disparate metrical
intuitions.  He acknowledges, even celebrates, the interaction of composer,
performer, listener in creating meter, and shows how tempo, the
listener&#146;s attention, and various performance decisions affect the
perception of projection&#151; for instance comparing Boulez&#146;s and
Craft&#146;s recordings of Boulez&#146;s <i>le marteau sans
ma&icirc;tre</i>.</p>

<p>
[5.2] It is also remarkable that this carefully elaborated theory&#151;in
sharp contrast to some contemporary theories of pitch&#151;emphasizes
sensation over structure and feeling over logic.  The analyses treat not
quantities but qualities of (to cite a few examples) &ldquo;breadth and
spaciousness,&rdquo; &ldquo;suspense and elasticity,&rdquo; &ldquo;urgency,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;mobility,&rdquo; &ldquo;relaxation,&rdquo; &ldquo;focus,&rdquo; and
getting &ldquo;lost in a moment of ending.&rdquo;  Style, in this view,
&ldquo;is above all an environmentally (culturally and personally) specific
manner of feeling duration.&rdquo; Such statements may appear foreign to
some theorists, but Hasty makes them meaningful through a carefully
reasoned and clearly expressed theory of how such feelings arise from a
single, intuitively plausible principle.</p>

<p>
[5.3] Although the content of his projective theory is primarily speculative,
Hasty grounds it by telling references to a variety of psychological
studies.  Further important precedents for his ideas are revealed in the
original glosses and interpretations he provides of earlier music theory.
Heinrich Koch, for example, is cited to describe meter &ldquo;as a creative
act of attention, not bound by law, but arising from the exercise of our
cognitive or imaginative powers.&rdquo;  Mattheson&#146;s conception of
Bewegung&#150;movement through time&#150;is also cited as an early
recognition of the essentially processes aspects of rhythm.  The
19<sup>th</sup>-century theorist who most anticipates Hasty&#146;s theory
is Hauptmann, who clearly discusses meter as a process whereby duration is
created, a process grounded in an innate perceptual disposition for
measure.</p>

<p>
[5.4] Hasty also gives due consideration to recent rhythmic
theories&#151;Cooper and Meyer, Lerdahl and Jackendoff, as well as
Schachter and Rothstein&#151;finding a basis for dialogue even with those
that maintain an opposition of meter and rhythm.  Other supporting
references range widely through twentieth-century philosophy, science,
German music theory, and musicology.</p>

<p>[5.5] One important antecedent is inexplicably omitted.  There is no mention
of Wallace Berry&#146;s<i> Structural Functions in Music
</i>(Prentice-Hall, 1976), which is perhaps the most explicit previous
treatment of music in terms of process, as it is notably attuned to
&ldquo;the musical work transpiring in time&rdquo;(25).  Berry anticipates
Hasty&#146;s terminology:  &ldquo;metric units are initiated by<nobr> . . . </nobr>impulses of relatively strong projection&rdquo; (317).  He hears impulses to
have different functions, and represents impulse functions with vertical
and slanting arrows and lines on scores, as Hasty does.  He regards these
impulses as functional at different &ldquo;levels of metric structure,&rdquo;
and also allows for functional &ldquo;dualities,&rdquo; &ldquo;as when the
final impulse of a metric unit is both conclusive and anticipative at the
same level&rdquo; (328).  Since Hasty spends so much effort at acknowledging
tangential theories, it would have been enlightening to read his comments
on a theory that is a perhaps distant but nevertheless distinctive
precursor of his own.  (Perhaps he or others will now consider how his work
relates to this and to more recent treatments of meter as process.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[5.6] Some other minor negligences also bother me.  The book suffers from a
few production problems: a smattering of typographical mistakes in the
text, and, more seriously, some rhythmic errors in the musical examples
(Ex. 15.2, an excerpt from <i>le marteau</i>, is an especially egregious
and by no means solitary instance).  More substantively, many analytical
decisions about interpreting the onset of an event as a dominant beginning
or a continuation hinge on questions of segmentation that are not addressed
directly by the theory.  Hasty gives the impression that these questions
are impossible to address systematically, but a more explicit discussion of
segmentation would help justify some of his analytical decisions.</p>

<p>
[5.7] This book is not an easy read.  The concepts are original and their
author is thorough, so their exposition is long, detailed, and
philosophical. Since the theory does not assume any of the common ways of
thinking about meter and rhythm, it may not fall into most reader&#146;s
comfort zones. Indeed it demands sustained concentration&#151;and a good
memory, since the brief index provides little help.  But I found it
absolutely compelling.  It is a vital contribution that has broad potential
to affect how we listen, value, and teach music of all
styles&#151;potential that will be realized to the extent that we attend to
the insights it contains.</p>
