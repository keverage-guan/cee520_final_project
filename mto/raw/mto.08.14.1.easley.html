<p>[1] Christopher Alan Reynolds&#8217;s <i>Motives for Allusion</i> has received wide 
attention from reviewers who often seem to be as anxious to recount their own 
preoccupations with the topic of musical allusion as to provide a close reading 
and evaluation of the text itself. Given the elusive nature of the topic, this 
is understandable. Attempting to comprehend just how we should view and 
understand these musical puzzles leads many a scholar into the thorny territory 
of ascribing meaning and intention. Despite the inherent problems of the topic, 
Reynolds charges forward with his own views, ultimately leaving the reader to 
decide what she or he believes.</p>
<p>[2] Reynolds defines allusion as &#8220;an intentional reference to another work made 
by means of a resemblance that affects the meaning conveyed to those who 
recognize it&#8221; (p. 6). As reviewer Michael Klein notes, &#8220;Here all the troubles of 
allusion are laid bare: the problem of intention; of the likelihood that an 
audience will recognize the resemblance; and of the meaning that accrues its 
recognition.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Klein&#8217;s statement casts a light on what are perhaps the most 
problematic aspects of allusion, especially that of authorial intention. He goes 
on to explain that, &#8220;In particular, embracing authorial intention seems 
courageous in the post-Barthesian world, where the &#8216;death of the author&#8217; 
threatens to render moot any argument hoping to recover a poetic level of 
allusion.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Recognizing this knotty aspect, Reynolds admits, &#8220;intentionality 
is an important element, however problematic it may be to determine,&#8221; and in the 
end, decides that intentionality is important for understanding the 
compositional process and in considering questions of originality (p. 6).</p>
<p>[3] Reynolds strives 
forward with nine chapters devoted to several different aspects of allusion, 
which explore how composers concealed their allusions (Chapter 2); whether 
composers chose to assimilate (Chapter 3) or contrast (Chapter 4) the original 
source of a musical allusion; the practice of adding a text to previously 
composed instrumental music (Chapter 5); the use of musical ciphers (Chapter 7); 
musical allusions as a form of tradition (Chapter 8); as well as the perennial 
problems of originality and intention (Chapter 6).</p>
<p>[4] In Chapter 2 (&#8220;Transformations&#8221;), Reynolds describes the various ways in 
which composers have concealed their appropriated motives (or themes).<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> In 
addition to changes in rhythm, meter, intervals, and the like, he introduces 
three other methods: motivic combination (occurring contrapuntally in two voices 
either simultaneously, melodically in succession, or combined into one single 
motive); octave displacement (e.g., the substitution of an ascending fifth for a 
descending fourth, a seventh for a second, and so on); and change of genre 
(e.g., transfer of a melodic idea from an opera aria to a Mass, from a song to a 
symphony, and so on). Reynolds states that in the examples presented throughout 
the book, &#8220;generally the alluding motive and the source composition share at 
least three features&#8221; (p. 33).</p>
<p>[5] In Chapters 3 (&#8220;Assimilative Allusions&#8221;) and 4 (&#8220;Contrastive Allusions&#8221;), 
Reynolds explores several examples in which composers choose either to create a 
meaning that is similar to the one borne by an original motive (assimilative), 
or to create a new meaning, often to distance the appropriation from its 
original source (contrastive). These categories are grounded in Mikhail 
Bakhtin&#8217;s double-voiced discourse; in his <i>Problems of Dostoevsky&#8217;s Poetics</i>, 
Bakhtin states that in any utterance or text, a speaker or author can use 
another&#8217;s &#8220;discourse for his own purposes, by inserting a new semantic intention 
into a discourse which already has, and which retains, an intention of its 
own.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Working from this understanding, Reynolds introduces numerous examples 
of both assimilative and contrastive allusions.</p>
<p>[6] One example of the latter comes from Schumann&#8217;s setting of &#8220;Schlu&szlig;lied des 
Narren,&#8221; the song that concludes Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>Twelfth Night</i>. Relying on musical 
similarities read against the backdrop of Schumann&#8217;s life at the time of 
composition, Reynolds hears a contrastive allusion to Schubert&#8217;s setting of &#8220;Erlk&ouml;nig.&#8221; 
While Schumann composed &#8220;Schlu&szlig;lied,&#8221; he and Clara Wieck were involved in court 
proceedings against Wieck&#8217;s father, disputing his disapproval of their 
prospective marriage. Most of Friedrich Wieck&#8217;s charges against Schumann had 
been dismissed, leaving only a claim of &#8220;habitual drunkenness&#8221; left to be 
disputed (p. 73&#8211;74).</p>
<p>[7] Reynolds interprets the text of &#8220;Schlu&szlig;lied&#8221; as speaking to &#8220;both the past 
struggle and to the improved prospects of his [Schumann&#8217;s] marriage&#8221; (p. 74). In 
addition, Reynolds strengthens his reading by presenting the verse that Schumann 
chose not to set, which speaks of drunkenness, the only charge pending against 
Schumann. Turning to Schumann&#8217;s musical setting, Reynolds notes the 
appropriation of the opening motive from Schubert&#8217;s &#8220;Erlk&ouml;nig.&#8221; While Schumann 
alters the mode and creates a dotted rhythm, the two maintain a similar melodic 
and rhythmic quality (<b>Examples 1 and 2</b>).</p>

	</table>

<p>Reynolds reads this allusion as contrastive because of the new meaning Schumann creates in appropriating Schubert: &#8220;In this contrastive reading, Clara&#8217;s father has assumed the sinister role of the Erlk&ouml;nig, and he&mdash;Robert&mdash;the role of protector&#8221; (p. 75). Reynolds&rsquo;s reading is convincing, no doubt attributable to his excitement for and careful presentation of the evidence. However, one may wonder just how likely it is that the allusion would be recognized without such extensive biographical information or, as Michael Klein calls it, Reynolds&rsquo;s &ldquo;nimble detective work.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p>[8] Chapter 5 (&#8220;Texting&#8221;) digresses from the topic of allusions in order to 
explore composers&#8217; practice of adding text to an existing piece of instrumental 
music. Although texting is not specifically a type of allusion, introducing the 
topic allows Reynolds to investigate issues of inspiration and originality, 
which become the focus of Chapter 6 (&#8220;Inspiration&#8221;). Using Brahms as an example, 
Reynolds discusses the conflict many nineteenth-century composers faced &#8220;between 
individual originality and the need to be a part of a cultural/national 
tradition&#8221; (p. 102). The creative process of composition involves a dual world 
of both the conscious and unconscious, as well as the prospect of aligning 
oneself with the &#8220;masters&#8221; while maintaining a sense of originality, often 
leaving composers unwilling to admit their appropriations publicly. In addition, 
Reynolds argues that to understand the intention behind allusions, we must 
accept that there are interactions that fall between the two extremes of 
conscious and unconscious creativity. This allows a composer to create a motive 
and only later recognize its connection to another work, as well as to &#8220;begin 
with a conscious allusion and still permit that motive to be subjected to his 
own unconscious thought processes&#8221; (115).</p>
<p>[9] As an example, Reynolds introduces Brahms&#8217;s lied &#8220;Die Mainacht,&#8221; op. 43, no. 
2, which bears several striking resemblances to Chopin&#8217;s Impromptu in F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> major, 
op. 36, no. 2. In addition to the same formal pattern&#8212;ABA&#8212;in which the A and B 
sections are tonally separated by a major third, the two pieces also share a 
similar opening motive (<b>Examples 3 and 4</b>).</p>

<p>Apparently, Brahms did not initially recognize the similarities between his and 
Chopin&#8217;s compositions, but from documentary evidence and a speck of speculation, 
Reynolds suggests that Brahms eventually did recognize the resemblance. Reynolds 
uses Brahms&#8217;s own description of his conscious and unconscious thought processes 
as evidence of Brahms&#8217;s intentions. </p>
<p>[10] In a conversation with friend George Henschel&mdash;who later transcribed Brahms&rsquo;s statement&mdash;Brahms described his creativity as some sort of &ldquo;mystical process&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>There is no real <i>creating</i> without hard work. That which you would 
call
invention, that is to say, a thought, an idea, is simply an inspiration from 
above, for which I am not responsible, which is no merit of mine. Yea, it is a 
present, a gift, which I ought even to despise until I have made it my own by 
right of hard work (p. 111).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same conversation, Brahms then characterized his creativity as an 
unconscious act: &#8220;It is as with the seed-corn; it germinates unconsciously and 
in spite of ourselves&rdquo; (p. 111). And, in perhaps the most provocative portion of 
the letter, Brahms notated the first phrase of &#8220;Die Mainacht&#8221; as an example to 
his friend Henschel. Reynolds argues that by taking Brahms at his word, a 
scenario begins to arise as to how Brahms created &#8220;Die Mainacht.&#8221; </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>. . . the opening motive popped into his head <nobr>. . .</nobr> it came from somewhere other than the 
conscious intellect. The moment at which Brahms then felt moved to despise the 
gift was the moment when Brahms <nobr>. . .</nobr> recognized this motive as having previously been 
used by Chopin. (p. 111)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Brahms realized his unconscious appropriation, he began to make it his own 
via &#8220;unconscious germination&#8221; and conscious &#8220;hard work.&#8221; (p. 111) Even though 
Brahms may have originally received the motive from inspiration (the 
unconscious), he maintained the resemblances to Chopin&#8217;s original&#8212;a conscious 
act&#8212;thereby intending the allusion.</p>
<p>[11] Chapter 7 (&#8220;Naming&#8221;) turns to the notion of allusion as a form of play, an 
idea drawn from the writings of Johan Huizinga. In his <i>Homo ludens</i>, Huizinga 
states that play is based on &#8220;a certain &#8216;imagination&#8217; of reality,&#8221;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> or, as 
Reynolds adds, &#8220;the representation of reality by means of images&#8221; (p. 118). 
Introducing several &#8220;naming&#8221; motives, such as Bach&#8217;s BACH, Reynolds defines two 
general functions of this type of play: as a symbolic representation of an 
individual, or as a &#8220;means of depicting a person, usually by quoting or alluding 
to a work that had been composed by that individual, but sometimes by quoting or 
alluding to a motive from a work only associated with the individual&#8221; (p. 138). 
Reynolds concludes that, &#8220;the purpose of these tributes <nobr>. . .</nobr> is quite literally that 
which Huizinga defined as an element in higher forms of play: to name and thus 
to raise the named &#8216;into the domain of the spirit&#8217;&#8221; (p. 137).</p>

<p>[12] One of Reynolds&#8217;s more problematic assertions involves a transposition of 
the BACH (B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8212;A&#8212;C&#8212;B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/natural.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">) motive to A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8212;G&#8212;B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8212;A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/natural.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> in Fanny 
Hensel&#8217;s Allegro agitato in G minor. Although Reynolds interprets it as a 
statement of the BACH motive, R. Larry Todd attributes less significance to the 
example, hearing it as a mere doubling of the soprano line of F&mdash;E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&mdash;G&mdash;F 
(<b>Example 5</b>).<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Hensel&#8217;s practice of using the BACH motive in many of her compositions lends 
credence to the allusion, but ultimately, the reader is left to evaluate the 
plausibility of Reynolds&#8217;s reading. In concluding the chapter, Reynolds notes 
that although BACH functioned first as a musical signature in Bach&#8217;s own pieces, 
it gradually emerged as a more global symbol of &#8220;German musical nationalism&#8221; (p. 
138). The symbolic status of the motive grew into a web of allusions to both the 
progenitor as well as those others&#8212;such as Beethoven&#8212;who appropriated it in a 
show of nationalistic pride. Reynolds continues, &#8220;In this way nineteenth-century 
uses of BACH take on characteristics of the allusive traditions for specific 
motives&#8221; (p. 139).</p>

<p>[13] Early in the book, Reynolds identifies the intertextual histories that 
motives acquire with extended use: &#8220;Motives have histories. The later in the 
nineteenth century a composer worked, the longer the history, the richer the 
possibilities for associations, whether meaningful or coincidental&#8221; (p. 3). From 
this understanding, Reynolds unfolds his definition of an allusive tradition as 
&#8220;the repeated use of a motive by many composers with an assimilative or 
contrastive symbolic meaning&#8221; (p. 145). He also qualifies that &#8220;it is not 
necessarily the first use of the motive with a particular meaning that defines a 
motive as symbolically significant, but [often] a subsequent usage&#8221; (p. 145).</p>
<p>[14] As an example, Reynolds introduces the motive for Jesus&#8217; last words, &#8220;Es 
ist vollbracht&#8221; from Bach&#8217;s St. John Passion. The examples range from the 
obvious to the tenuous including usages from C.P.E. Bach, Mozart, Haydn, 
Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Hensel, and Schumann. Complicating the discussion is how 
usage of the motive appears to change after Beethoven&#8217;s appropriations, after 
which the motive seemed always to be associated with cello or the bass register 
of the piano (p. 159). This leads Reynolds to theorize that while Beethoven may 
have been alluding to Bach, subsequent usages by Hensel, Mendelssohn, and 
Schumann may have alluded to Beethoven and Bach: &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> it is only after Beethoven 
that the theme develops additional traits of orchestration, key, or combinations 
with BACH that allow us to recognize even more substantial variations of the 
intervals <nobr>. . .</nobr> as possessing a symbolic meaning that encompasses Beethoven as well as 
Bach&#8221; (p. 159).</p>
<p>[15] In the final chapter (&ldquo;Motives for Allusion&#8221;), Reynolds concludes that 
allusions were primarily a form of play in which composers would conceal their 
musical debts just to the point where discussion can lead to debate. And in the 
end, Reynolds reckons that allusions are likely &ldquomore important for how music is 
made than how it is heard&#8221; (p. 182). In spite of this conclusion, Reynolds notes 
the satisfaction allusion has on our ears when we do recognize it. Countering 
this view is Raymond Knapp, who in his review of the book argues that allusions 
are equally important for us as listeners, as they color our musical 
experiences, and criticizes Reynolds for not addressing the how&#8221; and &ldquo;why&#8221; of 
that aspect.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>[16] Despite this and other inherent problems, <i>Motives for Allusion</i> has been 
universally praised for the breadth and depth of the information it contains. 
The in-depth analyses offer a variety of approaches to understanding allusions, 
including consideration of both musical and biographical events. Although he is 
unable to resolve perennially contentious issues such as authorial intention and 
just what, specifically, determines or conveys musical meaning, Reynolds&#8217;s book 
serves as an excellent resource for scholars with interests in 
nineteenth-century music, semiotics, and hermeneutics, among other topics. In 
addition, and most exciting to the present reviewer, Reynolds&#8217;s research may act 
as a template for the study of allusions in other eras of music, both past and 
present.</p>
