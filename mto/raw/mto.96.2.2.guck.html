Becker, Cusick, Maus, Lawrence Kramer, Tomlinson</font></p><p><font size='4'>ABSTRACT: Some recent musicology and theory has opened 
scholarly discourse to examination of issues long considered 
private, subjective, even embarrassing.  This paper examines 
a complex of such issues related to the transformation of 
childhood music-lovers into adult music scholars. Various 
individuals have described the replacement of musical 
experience either by &ldquo;separating it off from the scholarly 
endeavor&rdquo; (Tomlinson), musicology&rsquo;s solution, or by creating 
a &ldquo;<i>substitute</i> for sensitive, evocative description&rdquo; (Maus), 
theory&rsquo;s solution. I claim that this replacement occurs in 
reaction to powers music has to engage and change those who 
become intensely involved with it, powers that may attract 
the child performer but that may eventually disturb the 
increasingly autonomous adult. However, Suzanne Cusick&rsquo;s 
account of music as a sexuality proposes a more positive view 
of music&rsquo;s powers as powers to create pleasure through 
intimacy. These ideas suggest ways of describing my sense of 
intimacy with the opening solo and tutti of the Adagio of 
Mozart&rsquo;s A-Major Piano Concerto, K. 488, a sense of intimacy 
shared by virtually everyone I mention the piece to.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] [What follows is the text of the paper I presented at the 
annual meeting of the Society for Music Theory in New York, 5 
November 1995. Except for minor corrections, the text stands 
as it was read. There are, however, brief clarifications 
which I have placed in footnotes. At the outset, let me say 
that, in addition to the obvious subject of music loving, 
power is an underlying issue throughout: the power of music, 
of musical works, of music scholarship, and of music 
scholars. I would like to thank <i>Music Theory Online</i> for 
undertaking the publication of the paper.]<p>

[2] Lately I&rsquo;ve been struck by the realization that we music 
scholars frequently have an inclination to legislate 
<i>against</i> work different from our own. From my perspective as 
theorist, I see that some theorists would like the writing of 
personal accounts of musical experience to go away. On another 
side, musicologists interested in hermeneutics will often 
take time at some point in their papers to complain that 
theory and analysis detach musical works from their contexts, 
or to call theory and analysis formalist or positivist. (I 
feel a kinship with hermeneuticists so I find this painful.) 
And some musicologists write about what other musicologists 
should and shouldn&rsquo;t do. 
<p>

[3] What&rsquo;s thought-provoking to me is the fact that people 
are not content to regulate only their own work; they also 
wish to regulate the work of others. It&rsquo;s a bit like the 
Republican inclination to legislate sexual morality, and it 
makes me wonder what sense of danger is being responded to. 
There seems to be an underlying belief that the work the 
individual does and the work she or he wants to legislate 
against cannot coexist; only one or the other can survive. 
And there seems to be a fear that merely presenting one&rsquo;s 
work to the scholarly community to read and judge cannot be 
depended on to ensure its survival.
<p>

[4] Let me give you an example. Gary Tomlinson and Lawrence 
Kramer engaged in a particularly acerbic exchange in <i>Current 
Musicology</i> a couple of years ago.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Focal to the exchange 
was a reading by Kramer of the Mozart Divertimento for String 
Trio, K. 563, that takes the piece as dramatizing the role of 
the performers&rsquo; bodies.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Kramer says, &ldquo;The body thus 
represented is not a natural fact but a social figure: the 
performer&rsquo;s (and by proxy the composer&rsquo;s) body shuttling, 
with ambiguity and constraint, between labor and pleasure&rdquo; 
(13). The reading is a demonstration of the change that could 
arise in discourse with the emergence of a postmodernist 
&ldquo;critical musicology.&rdquo;
<p>

[5] Tomlinson questions Kramer&rsquo;s fidelity to postmodern 
tenets and Kramer responds in kind. More interesting to me is 
Tomlinson&rsquo;s questioning of the enterprise of close reading. 
Here is an outline of his ideas:

<blockquote>
      First, we might seek alternatives to the internalism
      and formalism that have dominated musicology. This is
      ostensibly Kramer&rsquo;s primary goal. But his insistence 
      on close reading of the notes and his locating of context
      in them undoes his good intentions. I would go farther
      than Kramer here and suggest that we need to move away
      from the whole constraining notion that close reading 
      of works of music, of whatever sort, is the sine qua 
      non of musicological practice. This notion has repeatedly
      pulled us back toward the aestheticism and 
      transcendentalism of earlier ideologies. (21&ndash;22)
</blockquote>

<p>[6] The Tomlinson-Kramer exchange could be viewed as nothing 
more than an academic power struggle, and I think it&rsquo;s 
largely been read and dismissed as just that. But Tomlinson&rsquo;s 
fervor is inexplicable in terms only of academic politics&mdash;Kramer seems to be getting to him somehow.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> There&rsquo;s 
something more at stake, and I&rsquo;d like to know what it is, 
especially since I can sympathize with the Kramer who wrote 
about the Divertimento. Kramer&rsquo;s account describes his 
personal experiences, and personal experiences always seem to 
have a love of some music as their source. Complaints about 
them sometimes seem to have a moralistic tone&mdash;Tomlinson&rsquo;s 
does. Kramer recognizes this possibility in his original 
paper when he says that &ldquo;the last thing a postmodernist 
musicology wants to be is a neo-Puritanism that offers to 
show its love for music by ceasing to enjoy it&rdquo; (9).<p>

[7] Though presumably we all came to our present positions 
through a strong attraction to music and to specific pieces, 
most theorists and musicologists, whether old or new, are not 
comfortable with &ldquo;music loving.&rdquo; Or perhaps I should say I 
think that no one is comfortable with &ldquo;loving.&rdquo; We do not 
call ourselves music lovers; we call amateurs music-lovers. 
My title was difficult to settle on because I kept finding it 
embarrassing.<p>

[8] I&rsquo;m going to explore the obscuring and revealing of 
personal relationships with music with the assistance of 
several writers who follow what might be termed &ldquo;new&rdquo; paths 
in musicology. <p>

[9] I&rsquo;ll begin with Fred Maus, who addresses the obscuring of 
involvement in his paper on gender.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> He points out that 

<blockquote>
      Neither [mainstream musicology nor mainstream theory]
      has been primarily concerned with sensitive accounts 
      of musical experience, but they have avoided the issue
      in different ways.  Mainstream musicology has put out a
      fact-oriented discourse that obviously has no bearing 
      on the details of musical experience, and therefore 
      doesn&rsquo;t tend to deny or distort such experience. It&rsquo;s
      as though musicology has relied upon a strict distinction
      between public discourse and a realm that is more private
      and intimate. In contrast, the discourse of mainstream
      theory, when it is unevocative, does not seem to be 
      protecting the privacy of listeners. It seems more 
      like a <i>substitute</i> for sensitive, evocative description,
      an <i>Ersatz</i> even; something that responds, publicly
      but speciously, to the desire for a shared articulation
      of musical experience. (276)
</blockquote>

<p>[10] Tomlinson notices substantially the same two means of 
evasion; he observes that &ldquo;[t]hose who sought to put the 
study of music on a scholarly footing were left with two 
options [I don&rsquo;t know why he thinks only two options, but 
they are]: positivistic description of historical data around 
the music and analytic description of the workings of the 
notes themselves. In the first option the experience itself 
of music was separated off entirely from the scholarly 
endeavor, while in the second it was transformed, its quasi-religious transcendence sublimated in technical accounts of 
musical process&rdquo; (18&ndash;19).
<p>

[11] In both Maus and Tomlinson, turning away from 
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; is the crux of the issue, accomplished by 
creating a &ldquo;distinction&rdquo; or a &ldquo;separation&rdquo; in the case of 
musicology or by creating a &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; or a 
&ldquo;transformation&rdquo; in the case of theory.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Particularly 
interesting is Tomlinson&rsquo;s choice of the psychoanalytic term 
&ldquo;sublimation&rdquo; to specify the &ldquo;transformation.&rdquo; It suggests 
the rerouting of primitive and powerful energies into 
rational, culturally sanctioned enterprises; the individual 
and subjective disappears into the collective and putatively 
objective.
<p>

[12] Maus&rsquo;s account suggests that it is the power of the 
piece and involvement with a powerful piece that is 
troubling. He speculates that, in an effort to understand or, 
more important, control the entities experienced as powerful, 
scholars may attempt to contain works within theories or 
historical data. So the avid child becomes the coolly 
detached scholar.
<p>

[13] I&rsquo;d like to look a little further into the power pieces 
have, by way of the means we use to detach ourselves from 
them, or to present ourselves as detached. It is common in 
music scholarship to speak of pieces as if they were 
artifacts, entities having material form, which we can study 
and discuss separate from ourselves.  Scholarly rhetoric 
creates a fiction whereby one speaks purely about a piece, 
out there, lying on a desk perhaps, unperceived by anyone.  
As if one really could stand at a distance from it.
<p>

[14] This is an illusion: sounds do not become music until 
they have entered a person, until they have been heard or 
imagined and attended to. Music exists only in the 
interaction between sound and the body-and-mind of an 
individual. There is paper and ink and there is sound 
separate from individuals; there is not music. 
<p>

[15] The interaction between a piece and an individual is 
crucial and unavoidable. It is also ineluctably subjective, 
though subjectivity is always mediated by culture (or rather 
cultures: western culture, academic culture at least). It is 
also shaped by the piece: if I care about some music, I must 
speak about <i>it</i>, I can&rsquo;t say just anything. In fact, Kramer 
proposes that music first &ldquo;addresses a determinate type of 
subject and in so doing beckons that subject, summons it up 
to listen<nobr>. . . . </nobr>Listeners agree to personify a musical 
subject by responding empathetically to the music&rsquo;s summons. 
Their pleasure in listening thereby becomes a vehicle of 
acculturation.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  For Kramer, particular musics create 
their appreciators; his ideas evoke those of Edward T. Cone, 
and both suggest human listeners who modify themselves, even 
if only temporarily, to suit the musical work.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><p>

[16] The fiction of the freestanding piece effaces disturbing 
realizations like these. We sometimes acknowledge that pieces 
change for us over time. Because musical works come into 
being as music only after they have entered us, to say that a 
work has changed is to say that I have changed. This no doubt 
could be disturbing to my sense of autonomy.  
<p>

[17] Belief in the freestanding piece also hides the even 
more basic and visceral realization that, if one is open to 
it, music has the power strongly to control or fill up one&rsquo;s 
consciousness and, in the process, to affect one&rsquo;s physical 
state; it has the power to engage the whole individual, mind 
and body. Kramer introduces a lengthy examination of this 
power by saying &ldquo;music acts like what psychoanalysis calls a 
transitional object, an object that, charged with charisma, 
temporarily crosses, blurs, and may even dissolve the 
listener&rsquo;s ego boundaries.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
<p>

[18] If ethnomusicologist Judith Becker is correct, the 
effect that I am speaking of is a variety of trance, probably 
resulting from synchronization (what is known as 
&ldquo;entrainment&rdquo;) of physical/mental rhythms with some rhythm or 
rhythms external to the individual.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>  Entrainment is a 
comprehensive brain state: &ldquo;One can reasonably assume that 
human brains become entrained to the rhythms of music and 
that these entrained rhythms involve not only acoustic and 
sensory motor areas of the brain, but areas in many other 
cortical and sub-cortical areas. Memory, past history and 
emotions become a part of the rhythmically pulsating brain&rdquo; 
(49). Becker associates the pleasure created by music 
listening with endorphin production.
<p>

[19] In other words, if a listener is open to it, musical 
sound may produce comprehensive, physiological changes in his 
or her brain. This may be pleasurable, but it&rsquo;s also powerful 
and one may feel out of control, that is, in the control of 
the music.
<p>

[20] Experience of music&rsquo;s power is definitive of music-loving. The powers I&rsquo;ve described seem to me genuinely part 
of close involvement with music. I can understand 
intellectually how they might be so disturbing that one would 
want to deny them. However, I cannot say that these 
experiences feel dangerous to me, nor can I endorse denying 
them.
<p>

[21] I think it&rsquo;s possible to put the issue of power in 
positive terms.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Suzanne Cusick describes falling in love 
with a song on the radio when she was very young.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> She 
proposes that &ldquo;[f]or some of us, it might be that the most 
intense and important way we express or enact identity 
through the circulation of physical pleasure is in musical 
activity, and that our &lsquo;sexual identity&rsquo; might be &lsquo;musician&rsquo; 
more than it is &lsquo;lesbian,&rsquo; &lsquo;gay,&rsquo; or &lsquo;straight.&rsquo; Be that the 
case or not, one might expect a significant amount of bleed-
through between a person&rsquo;s musicality and a person&rsquo;s 
sexuality as conventionally defined<nobr>. . . . </nobr>If music isn&rsquo;t 
sexuality, for most of us it is psychically right next door&rdquo; 
(70&ndash;71).  She defines sexuality as &ldquo; a way of expressing 
and/or enacting relationships of intimacy through physical 
pleasure shared, accepted, or given&rdquo; (70) and more starkly, 
&ldquo;[s]exuality<nobr> . . . </nobr>is a practice which allows movement within 
a field defined by power, intimacy and pleasure&rdquo; (71). 
Pleasure includes acts and sites &ldquo;beyond the usual ones&rdquo; 
(73).<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
<p>

[22] Let me for the moment look into the question of what one 
piece does to me in light of the ideas I&rsquo;ve discussed, 
particularly those of Cusick.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> The piece is the Adagio of 
Mozart&rsquo;s A-Major Piano Concerto, K. 488, though I&rsquo;ll talk 
only about the first solo and following tutti, measures 1&ndash;20.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
I&rsquo;ve tried to articulate pleasures, simple pleasures, I take 
in the work. My view of the solo results largely from playing 
the passage: I know it through touch as well as sound&mdash;I know 
how it moves from moving it.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup><p>

[23] I chose the Mozart because I find it particularly moving 
and poignant. I know that I&rsquo;m not alone, that there are 
others who are strongly drawn to this piece.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> What I want 
to understand is why we are so entranced; what makes each 
moment seem so special? What gives it this power to attract?
<p>

[24] I have come to realize that each moment is individually 
shaped, each has its special features, its graces. Over a 
fairly easily discerned voice-leading frame is laid a passage 
in which we hear very little repetition of figuration or 
rhythm&mdash;in which almost everything is lovingly detailed, 
lovingly reworked. And these particularities keep one 
listening closely, moment by moment. 
<p>

[25] Characteristic of the passage is delay in various forms.
The passage makes listeners wait for what they desire. Many 
of the delays can be understood as holding, suspended, on a 
note become dissonant or leaning on a dissonance, so that the 
rhythmic effect is, for example, one of delicately delaying 
measure 2&rsquo;s second B a moment, of anticipating measure 3&rsquo;s right-hand 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> very slightly, and of reaching measure 8&rsquo;s B only on the 
downbeat of measure 9, where it lingers. 
<p>

[26] For the pianist there is a feel of small stretches, 
often across sixths, that contrast with closer work. At the 
opening, after the small movement of the neighbor, attention 
moves back and forth between the thumb and the little finger. 
In measure 2 we hear not A&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> but A dipping to B rising again to 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>. As <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> in the left hand stretches way down to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, B waits, 
and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> rises again. This hand counterpoint feels like dancing 
the piece into sound.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Throughout the passage the movement 
from one voice-leading location to another remains 
unpredictable, the rhythms remain irregular, and this entices 
the listener or performer to follow, paying close attention 
to each movement of the line.
<p>

[27] Though the right hand&rsquo;s line narrows with the loss of 
the upper voice-leading line in measures 5&ndash;6, it stretches again 
in measure 7, overreaching the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> that is its goal to lean from an 
appoggiatura A, and continues to lean in the descending steps. 
Despite the quickening of the sixteenths, the right hand 
doesn&rsquo;t rush forward, because the two-note groupings hold 
attention in each careful movement.
<p>

[28] The piano, in its grace and unpredictability, seems made 
up just for each listener and we respond to its attention. We 
sense an intimacy with its plaintive speech.  The pianist 
cares for it by bringing it into being, lavishes attention 
on each minute figure. This is its delicate, enthralling 
power. 
<p>

[29] As the piano comes to rest, the orchestra enters.  Much 
as we loved the piano, traced every line, longed for each 
resolution, took pleasure in every moment, not wishing it 
over, the orchestral entry feels warm, welcomed. We want it 
and we want it to go on. Why?
<p>

[30] The immediate reason, I think, is the music&rsquo;s new 
breadth, a surrounding space in which listeners move more 
freely. The sustained sound of the strings and winds create a 
fullness of sonority. The gentle tune dips and rises 
regularly. The woodwinds float above the violins. One can 
spread one&rsquo;s attention across two-measure spans, expanses by 
contrast with the piano.
<p>

[31] As the phrase begins to repeat in measure 16, the orchestra&rsquo;s 
music becomes less purely broad-stroked and warm. When the 
piano returns, we are pleased.
<p>

[32] My colleague Roland Jordan has spoken more eloquently 
about the piece:
<blockquote>
      The most important realization was that the music 
      needed me, needs us. Its reluctance to move forward,
      the blockages, delays, displacements, and evasions 
      felt even in the first measures asks for our attention
      even to minute details because the music exists on the
      most intimate level of implication and nuance<nobr>. . . . </nobr>
      The difficulty of its unfolding, the evasive, rejected
      move toward A major, the diversionary turn to the 
      Neapolitan, the shifting pitches in measure eight
      are not deceptions, they create a sense of reticence,
      of an essential reservedness that draws us to the music,
      asking us to become part of its coming-into-being. But
      this is only half the story.
          When the orchestra enters<nobr> . . . </nobr>the music takes 
      control. We have attended, taken care of the music so
      far but as the cadence is achieved the music begins 
      to take care of us, it allows us to breathe. I realize
      why my language was sexual<nobr>. . . . </nobr>In the interchange 
      with this music I freely offer what I might give and 
      feel free to receive what the music offers&mdash;and I know
      why I love the music.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>[33] What is the point of these observations?
<p>

[34] My purpose may seem solipsistic. I wrote to recount how 
the music seems to me, first to make myself more sensitive to 
it, then to put it in circulation for others. It might 
stimulate thought about such things as the effect of the 
solo/orchestra contrast: the welcomeness of the orchestra and 
again the welcomeness of the solo. I wanted to understand the 
extreme sense of intimacy one can feel for a musical work&mdash;an 
intimacy akin to that one feels for a lover&mdash;as well as some 
of the powers of music, powers of attraction, engagement, the 
power to care for the listener. I wanted to understand my 
role as the pianist bringing the sounds into being, the 
pleasure I take in being completely focused to play each note 
and figure. Analysis is for me the articulation of a process 
of growing awareness, increasing closeness, of &ldquo;immersion in 
pleasure&rdquo; (29), to quote Cusick&mdash;or so I prefer it to be.
<p>

[35] Perhaps the most important place in which I put such 
ideas into circulation is in teaching. Cusick&rsquo;s description 
of teaching as &ldquo;the lover&rdquo; is to the point: &ldquo;I ask my 
students to open themselves to the music they hear, to let 
music &lsquo;do it&rsquo; to them, to become more intensely aware 
(physically, emotionally, intellectually) of what&rsquo;s being 
done to them. I teach them to ask of the music, later, how it 
achieved that effect<nobr>. . . . </nobr>These interrogations are designed, 
in effect, to increase the actual intimacy of my students&rsquo;
subsequent encounters with that music, or with any music, by 
increasing their knowledge of who it is, so to speak, who&rsquo;s 
been &lsquo;on top,&rsquo; and by increasing their skill, through 
practice, in the art of being music&rsquo;s beloved&rdquo; (74).  
<p>

[36] Why might someone want to forestall &ldquo;close reading&rdquo;? I 
can think of two possible reasons, given what I&rsquo;ve said. 
<p>

[37] First, to return to Tomlinson: he thinks that we need to 
examine our musical commitments and how they might foreclose 
other commitments, and he is right. But theory and musicology 
have only just begun to talk openly about the experiences and 
subjectivity of our personal involvement with music. There 
seems to be a big rush to bypass this step in order to 
problematize and perhaps discard it. I&rsquo;m suspicious. I am 
reminded of the observation of some feminists that, just when 
women and minority peoples have become visible as subjects, 
individual subjectivity is being questioned. Similarly, just 
when musical subjectivity is beginning to be discussed 
openly, that is, when culturally disempowered modes of 
relation with musical works are beginning to be discussed, 
the central role of culture in constructing musical 
subjectivity has been noticed and we are exhorted not to look 
at the individual and her relation to particular music, but 
instead to look at the cultural and historical context. 
That&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s important work, but why does the cultural 
pre-empt the personal?  Why does this admonition come just 
now?
<p>

[38] Second, perhaps when, as Tomlinson says, &ldquo;we dredge up 
our usual impassioned musical involvements from the hidden 
realm of untouchable premise,&rdquo; in order to make them &ldquo;a<nobr> . . . </nobr>
force to be reckoned with, challenged, rejected, indulged in, 
whatever,&rdquo; we find ourselves facing our most private selves.  
Maybe it feels like public exposure of embarrassing secrets. 
After an earlier paper on some of these issues, someone told 
me that he thought the personal issues were important, too, 
but that he just doesn&rsquo;t talk about them in public. Maybe it 
makes us queasy.  Maybe the queasiness results in part from a 
sense of embarrassment or shame at music&rsquo;s power &ldquo;over&rdquo; us. 
I&rsquo;ve tried to suggest, as Suzanne Cusick does, that power can 
be positive as well as negative.
<p>

[39] If I&rsquo;m interested in musical power, I&rsquo;m also interested 
in relations of power in academic discourse.  I&rsquo;m disturbed 
when individuals speaking from positions of power begin to 
say not only do this but also do not do that.  As I said when 
I began, such efforts to forbid occur across the entire 
spectrum of music scholarship. I&rsquo;m not naive&mdash;I know that we 
compete for journal space, conference time, students, jobs. 
But, when we&rsquo;re inclined to silence speech, I think it&rsquo;s time 
to examine our professional politics.</p>

&ldquo;Listening with Imagination: Is Music Representational?&rdquo; 
<i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i> 52 (1994), 47&ndash;61.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">My account of the solo derives in part from remarks of 
Sona Haydon made while coaching me in October 1993. Daniel A. 
Putnam proposes touch as an alternative to the visual model 
of knowledge for music in &ldquo;Music and the Metaphor of Touch,&rdquo; 
<i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i> 44 (1985), 59&ndash;66.  
He points out as well that &ldquo;[t]wo lovers who are sensitive to 
each other can learn something about each other&rsquo;s disposition 
[&rdquo;his or her inner state relative to the person or object 
being encountered&ldquo;] simply by touching&rdquo; (60). I am grateful 
to Fred Everett Maus for bringing this article to my 
attention.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">For example, at the mention of the piece during a 
conversation, Laura Sherman spontaneously began talking about 
her sense of intimacy with the piece. (Sherman is a harpist 
and a graduate student in music theory at The University of 
Michigan.)</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">This idea was suggested to me by Bell Yung&rsquo;s study of 
what he called the choreography of Chinese ch&rsquo;in music in 
&ldquo;Choreographic and Kinesthetic Elements in Performance on the 
Chinese Seven-String Zither,&rdquo; <i>Ethnomusicology</i> (1984), 505-
517.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">&ldquo;How does the tune go?&rdquo; Society for Music Theory,
