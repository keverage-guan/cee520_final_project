<h3><b>Introduction

</b>
</h3>
<p> <b>0.1 Lehman&#8217;s hypothesis</b> </p>
<p>[0.1.1] In two papers published in 2005 (<a href="#lehman_2005a" id="citation_lehman_2005a_67dc9aeec9625">2005a</a>,
<a href="#lehman_2005b" id="citation_lehman_2005b_67dc9aeec9628">2005b</a>), Bradley Lehman introduced the view that the recipe for the long-lost temperament of Johann Sebastian Bach had in fact been lying for all to see&#8212;not unlike Poe&#8217;s 
<i>Purloined Letter</i>&#8212;as a scribbling on the front page of the autograph edition of 
<i>Das Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>, the &#8220;Well-Tempered Clavier&#8221; (henceforth abbreviated as 
the WTC). As Lehman&#8217;s own learned comparisons with many previously known tunings make clear, this is a vexed question, and his &#8220;discovery&#8221; aroused a number of refutations, on various grounds. 

</p>
<p>[0.1.2] Lehman&#8217;s homepage, with abundant discussions and links, is accessible by 
<a style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank" href="http://www.larips.com">clicking here</a>. Here is a short summary of his interpretation of picture 
1. 

Let us recall the gist of the problem of tuning. Twelve just fifths (frequency ratio 3/2) amount to seven octaves plus a Pythagorean comma. Using eleven just fifths leaves a &#8220;wolf,&#8221; e.g. one ugly fifth, and all tonalities featuring this fifth will sound wrong. The abstract solution is equal temperament, wherein all fifths are reduced by one twelfth of a comma, but then all intervals are out of tune, and all scales sound (equally) disharmonious. The problem of tuning thus consists of adjusting 
the different fifth sizes, aiming at a temperament wherein all tonalities sound well. This is exactly the meaning of &#8220;Wohl Temperirte&#8221; as Bach explains it on the first page of 
the WTC. 
According to Lehman, the picture before the text (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>) gives the 
directions for such a temperament. </p>

<div style="width:800px">
    
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 1</b>. Bach&rsquo;s diagram on the first page of the WTC</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="amiot_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 1 thumbnail" src="amiot_fig1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[0.1.3] First the picture must be turned over (flipped upside-down); now consider all those loops as directives on how to tune successive fifths, beginning with F-C. The small inner loops represent nudges, slight moves of the tuning-pin.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> There are either 2, 0 or 1 nudges. The total is 13 nudges (=2+2+2+2+2+0+0+0+1+1+1), suggesting that each nudge should be one thirteenth of the Pythagorean comma<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> in order to get 
around the circle of fifths smoothly. Eventually, the circle of fifths begins with five short fifths (like numerous generalized meantone temperaments), carries on with three pure fifths and ends with intermediate-size fifths. 
It is fairly simple to realize in practice, in accordance with the well-known 
fact (or legend) that Bach tuned a harpsichord in a quarter of an hour. Lehman 
made a movie showing the tuning of an octave on YouTube,
<a style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/videos.html">accessible here</a>. The three different sizes of fifths are hard to distinguish when played alone; Lehman&#8217;s videos are much more explicative.</p>
<p> <b>0.2. Why it is unprovable . . . </b> 
</p>
<p>[0.2.1] The unsolvable problem of tuning has been well understood since Ptolemaios at least: twelve just fifths are slightly in excess of seven octaves, (3&#8725;2)<sup>12</sup> &#8776; 129.75 > 2<sup>7</sup> = 128, and more generally, there is no way any number of fifths can equal some number of octaves, as the equation (3&#8725;2)<sup><i>n</i></sup> = 2<sup><i>p</i></sup> admits no solutions in integers
<i>n</i>, <i>p</i> > 0. Fiddling with the sizes of fifths introduces problems with other &#8220;pure&#8221; intervals, like the major third, 
which should ideally be close to 5/4. 

</p>
<p>[0.2.2] There can be no ideal solution, since a number of different desirable properties 
compete with one another. Hence the musicological debate on the quality of Lehman&#8217;s temperament (henceforth called LT) might go on for ever, as proponents of any other temperament will put forward (usually in good faith) diverse qualities,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> often sporting personal preferences instead of facts (see for instance the acerbic [<a href="#lindley_and_ortgies_2006" id="citation_lindley_and_ortgies_2006_67dc9aeec96fc">Lindley and Ortgies 2006</a>] and its refutation by Lehman). 
</p>
<p> <b>0.3 . . . or is it ?</b> 
</p>
<p>[0.3.1] We need some objective quality to assess a temperament, preferably addressing the 
<i>whole</i> collection of major (and minor) scales&#8212;as Bach did, allowing arbitrary modulation in the composition, e.g. tuning the harpsichord once and for all before playing through the 24 tonalities in 
the WTC. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.2] The present paper puts forward a geometric quality of temperaments, measured with a single number (the 
<i>Musical Sameness of Scales</i>, or MSS); as it happens, the comparison of values of MSS for the different tunings in competition so far singles out LT as a clear winner, 
<i>primus inter pares</i>. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.3] This MSS makes use of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), a mathematical tool whose relevance to major scales was discovered very recently (<a href="#quinn_2004" id="citation_quinn_2004_67dc9aeec970f">Quinn 2004</a>; <a href="#amiot_2007" id="citation_amiot_2007_67dc9aeec9710">Amiot 2007</a>). Despite its technicality, the MSS puts forward a musical quality that Bach would have found desirable. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.4] Its discovery was serendipitous, and has nothing to do with Bach and 
the WTC. I was investigating 
the DFT of major scales for purely theoretical reasons, but 
endeavored to try it on unequal temperaments as an illustration for the Helmholtz &#8220;Klang und Ton&#8221; workshop in Berlin 
(May 2007). I came across Lehman&#8217;s story while browsing the internet, and included it in my list of various temperaments out of curiosity. Computing values of DFT for all major scales in all these temperaments, I noticed an exceptional quality of LT, only equaled by Werckmeister&#8217;s IV, or septenarius.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The notion of MSS was formulated in order to sum up this quality in a single number, for the sake of simplicity. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.5] Of course, I do not claim that the best temperaments (musically speaking) are just the ones with the greatest MSS. For instance, equal temperament gives an infinite value for MSS, but nowadays specialists agree on the fact that the equal temperament was abhorrent to Bach, as it still is to baroque musicians. The computation of MSS should come 
<i>after</i> all musicological arguments, enabling one to choose among temperaments already acknowledged as musically interesting. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.6] Readers are invited at this point to listen to the pleasant sound of the recordings in LT, which can be found on 
<a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bpl/larips/videos.html">this page</a>. Together with the record value of MSS, this makes a convincing case for Lehman&#8217;s hypothesis. But arguments, like a razor,<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> cut both ways: some lesser known temperament might achieve a better MSS than LT. 

Readers are strongly invited to test the temperaments they like best against LT with the formula for MSS given in section 
1. The computation is possible even with a pocket calculator (especially if it manages complex numbers) and only takes a few lines of programming with a computer. For instance, some alternative interpretations of Bach&#8217;s scribble have been offered, and the values of MSS for these temperaments are of interest. 

</p>
<p>[0.3.7] On the other hand, should some other temperament with a greater MSS supersede LT one day, the fact will remain that most or all temperaments reportedly in use around Bach&#8217;s time have a much smaller MSS, and this will remain a significant hallmark of LT. 
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center"><b>1. Sameness of Scales in a Temperament

</b> 
</h3>
<p>[1.0.1] I fear it is impossible to appreciate the import of the MSS value without some attempt at understanding the math behind it: most of the strength of the argument derives from Theorem 1. I have made use of footnotes and 
appendices in order to lighten the reading as much as possible. 

</p>
<p>[1.0.2] Roughly speaking, the DFT defined below enables one to appraise how close a scale<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> is to the mathematical paradigm of a regular polygon. This makes musical sense, because the largest DFT values 
<i>characterize</i> the major scales. As it happens, the distribution of these values calculated for the 12 major scales exhibits a very special feature in the case of LT. 

</p>
<p>[1.0.3] The next subsection (1.1) attempts a non-technical description. Readers averse to mathematics are invited to read it and then skip to section 
2, with tables of values of MSS for a number of temperaments. The precise definitions leading to the MSS are given in the sequel of this section 
(1.2&#8211;1.4), but the truly technical parts (the proofs of the Lemma and Theorem) 
are confined to the last section (3.2). 

</p>
<p>[1.0.4] I hope that most readers will go through the whole section, thus 
getting the gist of the argument, even if understanding the actual proofs 
requires some training in that prolific branch of mathematics called harmonic 
analysis. The complexity of the diatonic underlies the major scale and is hence responsible for a large part of the beauty of western classic music and the fulfilling emotions that we experience with it.

<p>[1.1.1] Consider the C major scale in fifth order: F C G D A E B. A tone-deaf person might not perceive that the interval between the extreme notes, B-F, is smaller than the other fifths. After all, the difference is the smallest possible inside the twelve tone universe, e.g. a semitone (or augmented prime). This means that the sequence of seven notes in the major scale is as close as can be, in the twelve-note ambient universe, to a completely regular sequence (a perfectly regular sequence is the whole tone scale, for instance). This can be seen graphically 
in <b>Video 1</b> (the major scale is in blue and the nearest heptagon is in red)</strong>. 

</p>
<p>[1.1.2] The mathematical tool that measures such regularities is the Fourier Transform (rigorously defined in the next subsection). It enables 
one to simplify considerably the data for periodic phenomena: in the domain of sound, for instance, a sound file recording one note played by a musical instrument can be summarized by a few figures giving the Fourier coefficients, which are in this case the weights of the different overtones. In the study of scales, we use a slightly simplified version, called the Discrete Fourier Transform. 

</p>
<p>[1.1.3] For a perfectly regular scale, like the whole-tone, the value <i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1) of this Fourier Transform would be equal to 1, or 100%. The major scales are the twelve seven-note scales with the greatest value of this 
<i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1)&#8212;not 100%, but about 98%. This is the most important point about <i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1): it characterizes the major scales among all possible seven-note scales. 

</p>
<p>[1.1.4] Now, in unequal temperaments, all scales are different, if only slightly. Hence, for each tonality A, we compute a different value of <i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1). The MSS is then defined as a measure of the discrepancy of the twelve values of <i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1) for the twelve major scales: the higher the value of MSS, the closer the values of <i><sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub></i>(1) are to one another. 

</p>
<p>[1.1.5] For high values of MSS, we expect all (major) scales to be equally close to their abstract model. Indeed, an infinite value of MSS means an equal temperament, wherein all scales sound identically. Hence, MSS can be taken as a measure of how much a temperament achieves Bach&#8217;s goal, 
where all tonalities coexist peacefully inside the same temperament.

<p><b>1.2. Discrete Fourier Transform of a Scale </b> 
</p>
<p>[1.2.1] Research on the DFT of scales originated in the preparation of the John Clough Memorial Days in Chicago (July 2005), organized by Richard Cohn and David Clampitt. 
There, Ian Quinn&#8217;s ground-breaking dissertation (<a href="#quinn_2004" id="citation_quinn_2004_67dc9aeec9727">2004</a>), wherein he rekindled an original idea of the late David Lewin 
(<a href="#lewin_1959" id="citation_lewin_1959_67dc9aeec9729">1959</a>), aroused interest in 
DFT among several researchers. Fresh developments may be found in 
<a href="#amiot_2007" id="citation_amiot_2007_67dc9aeec972b">Amiot 2007</a>. But a slightly 
different track, initiated a few months later by Thomas Noll, led to the present 
indicator of sameness of scales:

</p>
<p>[1.2.2] For instance, the (equal) tempered C major scale would be <i>C<sub>M</sub></i> = (0, 1&#8725;6, 1&#8725;3, 5&#8725;12, 7&#8725;12, 3&#8725;4, 11&#8725;12) and its DFT is

<p>[1.2.3] It may be useful to recall that the Fourier Transform is in general a tool for checking the periodicities of a given phenomenon. Here, it is easily seen that the map <sub>
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub> is defined from the cyclic group with 
<i>n</i> elements <img border="0" src="amiot/Zn.gif" align="baseline" width="19" height="15"> to the field 
<img border="0" src="amiot/C2.gif" width="12" height="12"> of complex numbers.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> The notes can be visualized 
as the points <img border="0" src="amiot/eq3.gif" width="39" height="15"> on the unit circle, which is the quotient structure of frequencies modulo octave: see 
<strong>Figure 2</strong>. 


<p><b>1.3. DFT and Maximal Evenness</b></p>
<p><b>Lemma 1</b>. |<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| = 1 
<img border="0" src="amiot/arr.gif" width="29" height="10">
<img border="0" src="amiot/A.gif" width="15" height="13"> is a &#8220;regular polygon,&#8221; i.e. 

</p>
			<p style="text-align: center">

			<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; For any other scale, for any t,</i> 
			|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| &#8804; 1. 
</p>


<p>[1.3.1] The first case  
			|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| = 1 occurs for instance when  
<img border="0" src="amiot/A.gif" width="15" height="13"> is a whole tone scale (in equal temperament), or an augmented triad, or diminished seventh. But of course a seven note scale in a (decent) twelve note temperament cannot be a regular polygon, as 12 cannot be divided into 7 equal integral parts (see 
Figure 2). Still, the best approximations of regular polygons are musically interesting scales: 

</p>
<p><b>Theorem 1</b>. <i>Let

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq5.gif" width="257" height="24"></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the scales in  with biggest value of 
</i>|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)|<i> are the Maximally Even Sets</i>. 
</p>
<p>[1.3.2] What are Maximally Even Sets? The ME Sets were defined in
<a href="#clough_and_myerson_1985" id="citation_clough_and_myerson_1985_67dc9aeec9731">Clough and Myerson 1985</a> and extended in

<a href="#douthett_and_krantz_2007" id="citation_douthett_and_krantz_2007_67dc9aeec9735">Douthett and Krantz 2007</a>, and the connection with DFT, discovered in

appendix, together with technical definitions. For the moment let it suffice to mention that 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Informally, a ME set is the &#8220;most regular&#8221; repartition of <i>n</i> notes in a given temperament. 
	</li>
	<li>ME sets (in equal temperament) are musically prominent scales: for instance the pentatonic, whole tone, major and octatonic scales all are ME sets in twelve tone temperament. 
	</li>
	<li>In several cases, including the major (and pentatonic) scales, this Maximal Evenness implies the &#8220;generated&#8221; quality, e.g. the major scale is generated by consecutive fifths.

</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that in a given context (here an equal-tempered chromatic ambient universe) the size of |<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| measures the
<i>regularity</i> of the scale, i.e. its closeness to a regular polygon. The above theorem, as the next proposition, can bear some degree of approximation,<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> and hence both still stand in all common tunings, which are close to equal temperament. 

</p>
<p>[1.3.3] However, we only need the case of 7-note ME sets in 12-tone temperaments: 

</p>
<p><b>Proposition 1</b>. <i>In 12 tone equal temperament, the Maximally Even 
Scales with 7 notes </i>(<i>e.g. the seven-note scales </i>  
<img border="0" src="amiot/A.gif" width="15" height="13"><i> with greatest value of 
</i>|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| ) <i>are 
precisely the 12 major scales.</i>
</p>
<p>[1.3.4] 

Now we can see that |<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| really measures the closeness of 7-note scale    
<img border="0" src="amiot/A.gif" width="15" height="13"> to the theoretical regular heptagon, which appears as a common goal, a Platonic model, that major scales strive to approximate as best they can: this is the meaning of the last proposition.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>

<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 3</b>.

<p>[1.3.5] 

From now on, all we need to remember is this meaning of |<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)|. For instance, if scale   
<img border="0" src="amiot/A.gif" width="15" height="13"> is a regular heptagon (say a &#8220;whole-tone scale&#8221; in 14-note equal temperament) then 
|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| = 1; for any major scale A in 12-tone equal temperament, 
|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| &#8776; 0.988846. This is a fundamental feature of major scales and not a mere curio: a basic fact about DFT, Parseval&#8217;s formula, states that &#8721; 
<sub>t=0...n-1 </sub>|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)|<sup>2</sup> = 1 = 100%. Hence, when 
|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| evaluates around 0.98 for a major scale, it means that almost all the energy of the scale is concentrated in this coefficient, as all other Fourier coefficients are negligible. In the case of other, random, seven-note scales, the energy is spread between the seven coefficients: for a chromatic succession of 7 notes, 
|<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)| is roughly 0.74; see 
<strong>Figure 3</strong> (the scale with the highest peak is the diatonic; the other one is a random collection of seven notes). It is also worth considering the scales with second best value of |<sub><img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" align="baseline"></sub>(1)|, which are quite different from major scales ([0234568], e.g. G<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font>, A<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font>, B, C, C<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font>, D, E). 
</p>

<p>[1.3.6] We are now ready to define the sameness coefficient of scales (MSS) inside a given temperament. 

</p>
<p><b>1.4. Sameness Coefficient</b></p>
<p>[1.4.1] A temperament is simply a collection of 12 tones, i.e. a subset  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> of [0,1] with 12 elements. Henceforth we will only consider scales with seven notes, that is to say ordered sequences of seven elements of  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12">. Let us assume that the elements of  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> are given in order: 

</p>
<p><b>Definition 2</b>. <i>A temperament, or tuning, is an ordered sequence of twelve different notes: 


</i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq6.gif" width="217" height="21"></p>
<p><b>Definition 3</b><i>. A major scale in temperament </i>
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"><i>is a sequence of the 
form </i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq7.gif" width="326" height="25"></p>
<p><i>where &#945; is a constant and the k<sub>i</sub>s are the indexes of the standard C major scale: 
0,2,4,5,7,9,11</i></p>
<p>Example: say <i>&#945;</i> = 5, we get the notes <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> with <i>i</i> = 5, 7, 9, 10, 12 = 0, 14 = 2, 16 = 4, i.e. F major. 

</p>
<p>[1.4.2] This enables us to compute |<img border="0" src="amiot/Faa.gif" width="30" height="16" align="middle">(1)| for all 
<i>&#945;</i> = 0...11, i.e. for the 12 major scales in  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12">. For instance, taking for  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> the so-called 
Pythagorean tuning with the &#8220;wolf fifth&#8221; between A<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font> and F, we get the following values for all major scales (in semitone order): 

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">0.9891; 0.9891; 0.9856; 0.9927; 0.9856; 0.9915; 0.9856; 0.9856; 0.9915; 0.9856; 0.9927; 0.9856</p>
<p>[1.4.3] Notice that all scales that do not contain the wolf fifth are isometrical, and hence share the same absolute value of the Fourier coefficient. The most striking fact about these values is their closeness to 1, which reflects the characterization of ME sets in 
Theorem 1. But the most important feature in a given temperament is the distribution of these values, which are exceptionally 
<i>close to one another</i> in the case of LT. In order to visualize this phenomenon more easily, we define 

</p>
<p><b>Definition 4</b>. <i>The <u>Major Scale Sameness</u> (MSS) of temperament  
</i>  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"><i> is the inverse of the biggest discrepancy between values of coefficients 
</i>|<img border="0" src="amiot/Faa.gif" width="30" height="16" align="middle">(1)|<i> for all twelve major scales in  
</i>  
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"><i>: </i>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq9.gif" width="327" height="51"></p>
<p>[1.4.4] This quantity is highest when all values of |<img border="0" src="amiot/Faa.gif" width="30" height="16" align="middle">(1)| (for all 12 major scales) are the closest, i.e. when all major scales are almost equally similar to the ideal (theoretical) model of the regular heptagon. For instance for Pythagorean tuning, we get a maximum (resp. minimum) value of 0.9927 (resp. 0.9856) and hence 
MSS (Pyth) =&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq10.gif" width="190" height="34" align="middle"> &#8776; 
140. </p>
<p>[1.4.5] For LT, no major scale comes higher than |<img border="0" src="amiot/Faa.gif" width="30" height="16" align="middle">(1)|&nbsp; = 0.991, but none comes lower than 0.987, so the MSS is particularly high:
MSS (LT) =&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq11.gif" width="102" height="34" align="middle"> &#8776; 
250 (actually a little more; see 
Figure 5 below).
</p>
<p><b>1.5. Musical relevance: playing in all tonalities</b></p>
<p>[1.5.1] Most analyses of different temperaments, including Lehman&#8217;s, put forward some particular intervals. The MSS coefficient on the other hand is comprehensive: it gives a measure of the sameness of 
<i>all</i> major scales in    
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12">. Though it tells nothing about the closeness of E-G<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font> to the pure third, it is well in tune with Bach&#8217;s own project in 
the WTC.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> A tuning with high MSS means that ALL major scales are similarly close to the theoretical heptagon, i.e. similarly &#8220;good.&#8221; Or should one say, &#8220;wohl&#8221;? 
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('amiot_examples.php?id=1',900,600); return false;" href="amiot_examples.php?id=1">Video 1</a> shows all diatonic scales in LT, together with their closest heptagons. It can be observed that though the 12 scales differ among themselves, they are quite similar in the way they resemble the regular heptagon: this is what MSS is all about. 
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">2. Comparison of MSS for different tunings

</h3>
<p>[2.0.1] This section is devoted to numerical results, i.e. tables of values of MSS. 

</p>
<p><b>2.1. Tables</b></p>
<p>[2.1.1] Let us begin with a computer program for the computation of MSS on a given      
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12">. It is convenient to put the values of the 12 elements of      
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> in some table: 

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">    
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> = {<i>t</i><sub>0</sub>,
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, ... <i>t</i><sub>11</sub>}</p>
<p>To do this, take any table of a temperament in cents and divide by 1200 to get the
<i>a<sub>i</sub></i>s. This will be the input of the function that computes the MSS. Now we loop through the twelve major scales: 
For <i>&#945;</i> = 0 to 11, compute the scale <i>&#945;</i> and its first Fourier coefficient
<i>c<sub>&#945;</sub></i>: 

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="amiot/eq12.gif" width="440" height="59"></p>
<p>Lastly, find the minimum and the maximum in those 12 values; subtract the 
former from the latter, and take the inverse<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> of the result:

<p>[2.1.3] In <strong>Table 1</strong>, consecutive fifths are given in cents from the origin; so in 
the program 
listed in Figure 4, the variable <font face="Arial" size="2">gamme</font> had to be divided by 1200. All origins (A) have been set to the same value, 0. Of course, different origins can be given for each tuning, but this is equivalent to some rotation on the circle of notes, and the quantity MSS, being geometric in essence, is invariant under such transformations.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.1.4] I selected only a few elements in the extensive family of meantone 
tunings. Lindley&#8217;s tunings are tabulated from Lindley and 
Ortgies&#8217;s acerbic refutation (see <a href="#lindley_and_ortgies_2006" id="citation_lindley_and_ortgies_2006_67dc9aeec975e">Lindley and Ortgies 2006</a>): the first two are built respectively with sevenths of Pythagorean and syntonic comma, and the last is the tuning used in the Michaelstein 
conference (this one found favor with Lehman). Similarly, I added the Sparschuh 
tuning and the previous Lehman proposition (dated 1994) as possible competitors, other interpretations of the scribble being, of course, of particular interest. 

</p>
<p>[2.1.5] I hope that through the process of chain-quotation, the exact values of these tunings have been preserved. As the computations have been carried through the professional software Mathematica<sup>&reg;</sup>, with 64 bit arithmetic, we can hope to be rid of the rounding errors that blemished several controversies, and that resulted from incompatible unit conventions and inadequate software (Excel<sup>&reg;</sup>). 

</p>
<p>[2.1.6] It is quite clear on these values that LT achieves by far the best value of MSS 
among temperaments prior to WTC, except for Werckmeister 
4<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> which reaches almost equal value. It is interesting to see which classical tunings figure well in this table: Kirnberger&#8217;s are in good standing, 
and so is Valloti, but it is notable that the Pythagorean tuning supersedes Zarlino and the meantone temperaments. Remember that MSS measures a closeness between major scales, not the quality of, for instance, the twelve fifths.

<p>[2.1.7] Graphic comparison of a few TeTs is available in
<a style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank" href="http://canonsrythmiques.free.fr/movies/SomeTeTs.mov">this movie</a>, where one can see the value of all Fourier coefficients changing with the different diatonic scales. The value of the leading coefficient
<i>a</i><sub>1</sub> is apparent as the radius of a golden disk, whose size varies more or less according to the chosen TeT.

</p>
<p><b>2.2. Minor scales</b></p>
<p>[2.2.1] As watchful readers will have noticed, the MSS has so far left aside half of 
the WTC: 
J.S. Bach also wrote preludes and fugues in all 
<i>minor</i> tonalities. MSS is originally a measure of &#8220;diatonicity&#8221;: could it also be used for testing minor scales? If by &#8220;minor,&#8221; one should understand the harmonic minor scale, then the theoretical relevance is poor.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> But this natural assumption, taught to every kid in music school, has long been challenged by specialists.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Perhaps the most &#8220;natural&#8221; form of the minor is also diatonic, meaning that MSS is relevant both for minor and major tonalities. 

</p>
<p>[2.2.2] It might be interesting, though, to try this comparison on other familiar scales, like the ascending melodic minor [023579a]. 

</p>
<p><b>2.3. First five fifths equal</b></p>
<p>[2.3.1] Permutations of the values of the different fifths of LT can be 
tried. The result is illuminating. As we have already discussed, an optimal value of MSS <nobr>(= &#8734;)</nobr> is attainable, in equal temperament. This is not realistic, as most musicologists now agree that equal temperament was as abhorrent to Bach as it was to many, before and afterwards. 

</p>
<p>[2.3.2] So it should come as no surprise that some possible (nonequal) temperaments improve the value of MSS. 
This is the case for Werckmeister IV, which, though rational-valued, is a close approximation to equal temperament.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> I found several such tunings 
by trying all permutations of the values of fifths that Lehman attributed to the three different kinds of loops in Bach&#8217;s scribble. For instance, the one which corresponds to the sequence of adjustments 0, -2, -2, -2, 1, -2, 1, -1, 0, -1, 0, -2,<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> has a much higher value of MSS. 

</p>
<p>[2.3.3] Such artifacts are generally very close to equal temperament. I did not recognize any known tuning in them, though learned readers might. 

</p>
<p>[2.3.4] But strikingly again, LT is still a winner when these permutations are confined to the six last fifths, i.e. when we keep the first five fifths equal: here I am discussing adjustments of the form -2, -2, 
-2, -2, -2 followed by any permutation of 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1. This must be relevant, as it was and still is common practice to start the tuning of a keyboard instrument by five equal fifths (often slightly shorter than a pure fifth), thus tuning equally the Guidonian hexachord FCGDAE. I certainly did, long before I ever heard of Bradley Lehman. This is true of all meantone tunings, for instance, and also very obvious for a musician accustomed to tonal music, since it is still desirable to have many equal fifths inside the scale(s) he or she plays in. Many harpsichord, organ, or piano-forte playing readers will acknowledge that they begin their own tunings by equal fifths between F-C-G-D-A-E. See below a discussion of O&rsquo;Donnell&#8217;s objection, though 
(<a href="#o&rsquo;donnell_2006" id="citation_o&rsquo;donnell_2006_67dc9aeec9763">2006</a>).
</p>
<p><b>2.4. Other values of the wiggles</b></p>
<p>[2.4.1] One weak point of Lehman&#8217;s proposition is his arbitrary calibration of the wiggles as multiples of PC/12 (PC = a 
Pythagorean comma). On the other hand, changing this value ever so slightly falls within the approximation involved in any practical tuning&#8212;this is not exact science! On investigation, I tried variants of LT, replacing the unit PC/12, or 
1.955 cents, by values close to it. The value of MSS can thus be increased slightly: if the fundamental wiggle is reduced to 2.16 cents, MSS reaches 278.7 instead of 260. This is the best possible improvement in that direction, with 

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">    
<img border="0" src="amiot/T.gif" width="13" height="12"> = {0; 95.685; 196.71; 
297.795; 393.42; 498.105; 593.73; 698.355; 797.64; 895.065; 997.95; 1091.78}</p>
<p>[2.4.2] Of course, a difference of 0.165 cents is hardly perceptible by ear&#8212;it is roughly a 
150th of a comma! It is only the different order of fifths, the geometry of the scale, and not the change of comma, that explains the record value of MSS; the different value of the comma in Lehman&#8217;s first proposition in 1994 (labeled Lehman94 in 
Table 1) has nothing to do with its poor value of MSS. 
</p>
<p><b>2.5. Other interpretations of the wiggles</b></p>
<p>[2.5.1] Some have questioned the <i>original note</i> of the tuning: is it F&#8212;a common practice&#8212;or do some further curlicues along the scribble (look again at 
  <strong style="font-weight: 400"><a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('amiot_fig1.html',900,450); return false;" style="text-decoration:none" href="amiot_fig1.html">Figure 1</a></strong>) indicate the position of C, or D, or some other note? As far as the MSS is concerned, this is irrelevant, as a &#8220;well tempered&#8221; instrument will remain so even if the tuning is transposed, in the sense that all tonalities still sound well. Of course it would be nice to know 
<i>exactly</i> Bach&#8217;s tuning (giving <i>specific</i> different 
colors, i.e. <i>Affekt</i>, to different tonalities) but MSS cannot discriminate between tunings there, as it is invariant under a change of origin of the tuning.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 

Similarly, MSS cannot help us decide whether turning around the page (as Lehman did) is permitted, or mandatory: the inversion of a tuning shares the same geometric values,<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> and the sequence of wiggles (-1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2) has the same MSS as LT&#8212;a nice feature for 
contrapuntalists. In other words, using Lehman&#8217;s recipe with fourths instead of fifths yields exactly the same value of MSS. 

</p>
<p>[2.5.2] MSS can help, though, to discuss whether the wiggles mean consecutive 
fifths or consecutive semitones. This is a strong argument, as O&#8217;Donnell points 
out (<a href="#o&rsquo;donnell_2006" id="citation_o&rsquo;donnell_2006_67dc9aeec9772">O&rsquo;Donnell 2006</a>) that the order of tonalities in 
the WTC is given in semitones not in fifths&#8212;but Chopin, for instance, did 
the opposite in his 
<i>Preludes</i>, which clearly refer to the WTC. Indeed, MSS makes a fair case for O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s proposed tunings, as seen from the values of MSS in 
<b>Table 2</b>, computed from Lehman&#8217;s comprehensive answer to O&#8217;Donnell:

</p>

<div style="width:800px">
    
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 2</b>. MSS for O&rsquo;Donnell-like tunings</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="amiot_examples.php?id=6&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 2 thumbnail" src="amiot_table2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[2.5.3] Several falsifications, in the sense of Popper, have been tried. In each case, LT emerges a winner. It is clearly a very special temperament, not only in its closeness to Equal Temperament, but in the homogeneity of all 24 scales. This constitutes a strong vindication of Lehman&#8217;s claim. 
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">3. Conclusion and perspectives

</h3>
<p>[3.0.1] The MSS criterion arguably puts emphasis on the sameness of fifths <i>inside</i> the temperament. This goes some way towards explaining why permutations of the wiggles fail to improve MSS, when the first five are kept identical (see subsection 2.3); it also explains the fair value of MSS for Pythagorean (Ptolemaic) tuning, for instance. But this argument has 
its limits, as the discussion on all permutations of the wiggles proves. Still, it is quite important musically, as keyboard 
instrument players will readily agree, to find in <i>any</i> major scale a sequence of 3 (and preferably more) identical fifths in a row. This makes it easier to tune together with string instruments, for instance. 

</p>
<p>[3.0.2] Apart from aesthetic and other indefinitely debatable arguments, the computation of MSS gives a steadfast comparison point for tunings aimed at tonal music. Of course, it should not be considered as the sole criterion for the quality of a tuning&#8212;for instance, equal temperament would then be unbeatable, and Pythagorean tuning would be better than Kirnberger&#8217;s&#8212;but it does make sense to use it, among other criteria, to compare tunings 
<i>already</i> short-listed for historical and musical reasons. 

</p>
<p>[3.0.3] A limitation to the discriminating power of MSS is its indifference towards isometric transformations. Starting the tuning with C or F<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></font> or any note does not change the value of MSS, neither does tuning in fourths instead of fifths, i.e. reversing the cycle of fifths. This last point is one that raised much discussion: is Lehman right in turning around the first page of 
the WTC? As we discussed previously, MSS brings no answer there. But consideration of the 
<i>phase</i> of the Fourier coefficients (and not only of <i>module</i>), or maybe scrutiny of other Fourier coefficients (e.g. 
<img border="0" src="amiot/fa.gif" width="22" height="14" align="middle">(0)), might help refine the analysis (I am indebted to Thomas Noll for these suggestions). 

Other measures of the <i>sameness</i> of scales inside a given temperament might, and should, be proposed, as this criterion makes sense when considering 
the WTC.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> For one thing, the MSS is designed primarily for comparison of the major scales, and perhaps some other measurement should give equal standing to the minor scale in some form. 

</p>
<p>[3.0.4] The computations made for this paper are by no means exhaustive, and I hope that some other researchers will complete them. I intentionally refrained, though, from computing MSS on many tunings that either fall far from Bach&#8217;s universe or appear too arbitrary. Should some major tuning be lacking in this analysis, it is because I was not aware of its existence. 

Some independent computations&#8212;independent from the author&#8217;s&#8212;have 
confirmed that LT has a greater value than most of 60 Baroque (or earlier) 
temperaments.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.0.5] A puzzling case is Werckmeister 4, a serious challenger of LT for the value of MSS. It stems from most modern authorities that the relationship 
of Bach to Werckmeister was more about counterpoint than tuning, but maybe this fresh evidence will rekindle interest in the notion that Bach shared at least some of Werckmeister&#8217;s original ideas about tuning. 

</p>
<p>[3.0.6] My modest intention was to add some nonsubjective evidence to the discussion of Lehman&#8217;s hypothesis. In the present state of the calculations in Table 
1, the MSS criterion strongly supports Lehman&#8217;s theory. Maybe further efforts in the same line will help refine his claim&#8212;or crown some other tuning that I cannot foresee.

<p>[3.2.1] I give the proof of the theorem in the simpler case<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>			when the number of notes <i>n</i> is coprime with the cardinality of the temperament, 
<i>m</i>. In this paper we have <i>n</i> = 7, <i>m</i> = 12. In such cases, a ME set is 
<i>generated</i> (<a href="#clough_and_myerson_1985" id="citation_clough_and_myerson_1985_67dc9aeec9785">Clough and Myerson 1985</a>), i.e. the indexes of its notes are in arithmetic sequence modulo 
<i>m</i>, with a ratio <i>f</i> of the sequence that is the multiplicative inverse of 
<i>n</i> mod <i>m</i>. In the case <i>n </i>= 7, <i>m</i> = 12, this expresses the fact that the major scale is a sequence of fifths, i.e. (0, 7, 7 + 7 &#8801; 2, 9, 4, 11, 6) or any transposition thereof. The ratio
<i>f </i>= 7 is the inverse of <i>n</i> = 7: it checks <i>f</i> &times; <i>n</i> = 7 &times; 7 = 1 + 4 &times; 12 &#8801; 1 mod 12.

<i>k</i>, similarly for <i>n</i>); and hence bijective because the cardinalities of both domain and codomain are finite and equal. 
</p>
<p>[3.2.2] This enables us to choose <i>n</i> couples (<i>k</i><sub>0</sub>, 0), (<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, 1) ... (k<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>,
<i>n</i> - 1) in
