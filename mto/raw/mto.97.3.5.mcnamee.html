<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section0"><b>0. Introduction</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[0.1] I have two goals for my research with regard to multimedia
publishing on the Internet:  1) to explore ways to enhance music
theory publishing by including sound and graphics; and 2) to
encourage greater use of the Internet for music by creating a
template which students and colleagues can use to author their
own work.</p> 
 
<p>[0.2] The Internet offers the promise that music theorists and
their students will be able to integrate and synchronize high
quality audio and images with their text analyses.  One of the
challenges is to make on-line multimedia publishing as easy for
the author as print publishing is today.  While all of the basic
technologies necessary for on-line multimedia publishing exist
today, the technology still places a greater burden on the author
than does print publishing.  (This article is a significant
revision of a paper presented at the Mozarteum in Salzburg,
Austria for a symposium entitled &ldquo;New Media:  Technology and
Internet for Creative Applications,&rdquo; held January 4&ndash;7, 1997.) 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section1"><b>1. First Goal:  Enhancing Music Theory Publishing</b></a></p>

 
<p>[1.1] My first goal, an enhanced form of music theory publishing,
combines high-quality sound synchronized with musical examples.
In order to follow the discussion below, you should link to my
analysis of Grazyna Bacewicz&rsquo;s <i>Piano Sonata No. 2</i> at the
following URL:  <a href="http://mcnamee.graham.com">http://mcnamee.graham.com</a>
</p>
 
<p>[1.2] The format of this site requires a large computer monitor.
Choose one of the versions of the analysis.  If you cannot see
two frames, one which is a photo of a piano on the left-hand side
and one with instructions on the right, then proceed to the
section below which begins, &ldquo;Second Goal:<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;  The format of
that site (<a href="http://ash.swarthmore.edu/womuse">http://ash.swarthmore.edu/womuse</a>) works well even with
a smaller monitor.
</p> 

<p>[1.3] My analysis was written in 1993, mostly in text format, for
<i>Music Theory Online</i>
(<a href="../../issues/mto.93.0.4/mto.93.0.4.mcnamee.html">http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.93.0.4/mto.93.0.4.mcnamee.html.</a>).  In 1996, I
reworked the analysis into several different multimedia formats
for the World-Wide Web (<a href="http://mcnamee.graham.com">http://mcnamee.graham.com</a>).  In terms of
technology, the target platform for my work is a Macintosh, a PC,
or a Unix workstation equipped with a Netscape or Microsoft
browser.  At a minimum, the browser should be a version current
enough to display two frames and to support the Quick Time
plug-in.  Other formats on my site add the Shockwave plug-in and
Java applets.
</p>
 
<p>[1.4] My design for multimedia is to have scrollable text down
the left-hand side of the screen with the musical examples
appearing over to the right-hand side.  In order to save download
time, I recommend that you scroll down the center scroll bar
until you reach <b>Example 1</b>.  Click on &ldquo;Example 1&rdquo; in order to
see the score and to hear the audio.  (The pianist in this
performance is Charles Abramovic.)
</p>
 
<p>[1.5] The technical reason for this two-frame design is that
audio files are too large to be embedded along with text in only
one frame.  The scholarly benefit of this design is that while
the reader is waiting for the music to download, he or she can
still read the text.  The center scroll bar remains active during
the transfer of the music file.
</p>
 
<p>[1.6] If you are using the Quick Time version and scroll down to
<b>Example 2a</b>, you will notice that the score will &ldquo;flip pages&rdquo;
automatically, synchronized with the audio.  You are hearing near
CD-quality sound.  It is 16-bit sound, 11 kHz, but mono not
stereo.  (If you are using either of the streaming audio formats,
the Shockwave or the Java version, you must flip the pages
manually.  There should be no pause in the audio when you click
to turn the page of the score.)
</p> 

<p>[1.7] Three more examples on this site directly address the issue
of multimedia for music theory publishing.  The first one
addresses sketch material.  Go to <b>Example 3</b>, scroll a bit
further so that the sketch material is visible in the left frame,
then click on Example 3.  My design offers the opportunity to
study sketch material on the left-hand side, compare it to the
published score on the right, and, most importantly, to listen to
the passage under study.
</p>
 
<p>[1.8] The second example addresses the topic of MIDI sound.  In
this article, I discuss a Polish folk mode, the Podhalean mode.
To me, it made sense for the reader to be able to hear this
Podhalean mode, so I made a recording of it on a MIDI keyboard.
Scroll down in the article until you get to the button for &ldquo;The
Podhalean Mode.&rdquo;  Listen carefully to the audio for that link.
MIDI quality is fine for listening to a scale such as this (and
certainly fine for rudimentary piano playing), but MIDI is
unfortunately not suitable as a format for musical performance.
</p>
 
<p>[1.9] The last example I want to show in this article is
something that is impossible in print publishing.  Link to the
very last button, &ldquo;Analysis of the Development.&rdquo;  You need not
wait for the entire Quick Time movie to download; even if you
stop downloading after 20% you should still be able to see my
point, explained below.
</p> 

<p>[1.10] In this example you hear the Development of the Piano
Sonata.  The score will be on the bottom half of the screen,
synchronized with the audio.  In addition, my analysis is on the
top half.  This example has what I affectionately call the
&ldquo;bouncing yellow bar&rdquo; which highlights where you are in the
analytical graph as the music is played.  This design relates the
sound <i>both</i> to the analysis and to the score.
</p> 

<p>[1.11] In all of the examples above I hoped to show how
high-quality audio, when synchronized with musical examples, can
enhance music theory publishing in more than one way.
</p> 

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section2"><b>2. Second Goal:  Designing a Template for Other Authors</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[2.1] My second goal is to create templates for colleagues and
students in order to lower the barriers for authors who might use
multimedia on the Web for music theory publishing.  I used a
template and about four hours of individual instruction to help
five undergraduate, non-music majors design their own Web sites
in the fall of 1996.  The students were in no way technologically
more advanced than the typical Swarthmore College undergraduates,
and in some cases had only elementary computer skills.  Four
hours per student is not an insignificant commitment of time, but
I estimated that I spent over 700 hours developing my first Web
site from scratch, so four hours per student seemed to prove the
usefulness of the template!
</p> 

<p>[2.2] The students&rsquo; work can be found at the following URL:
<a href="http://ash.swarthmore.edu/womuse">http://ash.swarthmore.edu/womuse</a>.  I particularly recommend the
first three sites.  The first is a project by Julie Hovis on
Francesca Caccini.  The second is by Rebecca Johnson, whose
project is on the music of her great aunt, Rebecca Clarke, and
the third project, by Emily Mott, includes a Bantu midwives&rsquo;
song/dance.
</p>
 
<p>[2.3] Note that the two-frame design is still present.  For those
who are familiar with HTML tagging, you are of course welcome to
download and use all of my tagging in this site.  (The only
proprietary code is that for the Java applet.  Contact John or
Matt Graham at <a href="http://www.graham.com">http://www.graham.com</a>
 for questions about the Java code.)
</p>
 
<p>[2.4] My students never learned any HTML tagging, nor did they
need the Java applet.  My template was designed using the
Macintosh version of Claris Home Page.  This inexpensive software
is a drag-and-drop Web editor which relieves most headaches
associated with HTML.  A copy of the software was put on a
Swarthmore College server so that the students could work on
their projects at any time from their dorm rooms or wherever.
The Quick Time movies were created using Macromedia Director and
SoundEdit.  Scores and photographs were scanned using Adobe
Photoshop.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section3"><b>3. The Template:  Overall Two-Frame Design</b></a></p> 

<p>[3.1] The way I handled the design with my students was to give
them a twenty-minute demonstration, then to hand them a floppy
disk with the template on it.  By reading the above article, and
by seeing and listening to some of the musical examples, you will
have more than completed the demonstration portion.  I would be
happy to mail any interested SMT member a Macintosh floppy disk
with my Claris Home Page template on it.  All you need to do is
to drag your text and images to the appropriate spots and erase
my text.
</p>
 
<p>[3.2] For those who are comfortable with HTML, you can set up the
two-frame design with the following HTML tags:<br> 
 <br> 
&lt;HTML&gt;<br> 
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br> 
&lt;FRAMESET COLS=*,475&gt;<br> 
&lt;FRAME NAME=&ldquo;text&rdquo; SCROLLING=YES SRC=&ldquo;article.html&rdquo;&gt;<br> 
&lt;FRAME NORESIZE NAME=&ldquo;score&rdquo; SCROLLING=NO SRC=&ldquo;welcome.html&rdquo;&gt;<br> 
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;<br> 
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</p>
 
<p>[3.3] If you prefer the format which allows for smaller monitors,
you should change the &ldquo;475&rdquo; above to &ldquo;340&rdquo; (which allows for a
standardized reduction of Quick Time movies).  Some might feel
compelled to add to the HTML tagging above.  Here is some
slightly expanded HTML tagging, which works for smaller monitors:<br>
 <br>
&lt;HTML&gt; &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; &lt;FRAMESET cols=&ldquo;1*,340&rdquo;&gt;<br>
&lt;NOFRAMES&gt;<br>
&lt;BODY&gt;<br>
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;<br>
&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
&lt;/NOFRAMES&gt;<br>
   &lt;FRAME src=&ldquo;leftframe.html&rdquo; name=&ldquo;text&rdquo; scrolling=&ldquo;yes&rdquo;&gt;<br>
   &lt;FRAME src=&ldquo;rightframe.html&rdquo; name=&ldquo;score&rdquo; NORESIZE scrolling=&ldquo;no&rdquo;&gt;<br>
&lt;/FRAMESET&gt;<br>
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>4. Scanning Musical Scores</b></a></p> 

<p>[4.1] I use Adobe Photoshop for scanning, but any similar
application will do.  Save your images as either GIFs or JPEGs in
order to add images to the left-hand side of the article.  The
images of the musical examples needed for Quick Time movies on
the right-hand side should be saved as GIFs.  The version of
Director that I use (4.0) allows only images saved as GIFs to be
imported.  (I have been told that the more recent version of
Director allows for smaller sized formats like JPEG images.)
</p> 

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>5. Links to Musical Examples</b></a></p>

<p>[5.1] Because audio files and Quick Time movies are so large, one
should link to the large files only when necessary.  This is the
philosophy behind the two-frame design.  Claris Home Page allows
you to set up these links easily.
</p>
 
<p>[5.2] Those who are comfortable with HTML tagging can easily set
up links to musical examples.  In the two-frame design
above, I call the left-hand frame &ldquo;text&rdquo; and its HTML tagging
&ldquo;article.html&rdquo;.  Within &ldquo;article.html&rdquo; one can link to a musical
example (which will appear in the right-hand frame, called
&ldquo;score,&rdquo; with its own HTML tagging).  The tagging for
&ldquo;article.html&rdquo; is as follows:<br>
 <br>
&lt;A HREF=&ldquo;example1.html&rdquo; TARGET=&ldquo;score&rdquo;&gt;Example 1&lt;/A&gt;
</p>
 
<p>[5.3] The HTML tagging for &ldquo;example1.html&rdquo; (which includes a
Quick Time movie called &ldquo;newer1.mov&rdquo;) in the right-hand frame is
as follows:<br>
 <br>
&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;example1&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&ldquo;#FFFFFF&rdquo;&gt;<br>
&lt;EMBED SRC=&ldquo;newer1.mov&rdquo; Border=0 ALIGN=left <br>
HEIGHT=412 WIDTH=448&gt;<br>
&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</p>
 
<p>[5.4] For smaller monitors, the tagging for &ldquo;example1.html&rdquo;
(which includes a Quick Time movie called &ldquo;caccini.mov&rdquo;) is as
follows:<br>
 <br>
&lt;HTML&gt;<br>
&lt;HEAD&gt;<br>
   &lt;TITLE&gt;score&lt;/TITLE&gt;<br>
&lt;/HEAD&gt;<br>
&lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&ldquo;#FFFFFF&rdquo;&gt;<br>
 <br>
&lt;P&gt;&lt;EMBED SRC=&ldquo;caccini.mov&rdquo; WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=260 Border=0 Align=right&gt;<br>
&lt;/P&gt;<br>
&lt;/BODY&gt;<br>
 <br>
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section6"><b>6. Copyright Issues</b></a></p>

<p>[6.1] The very thing that makes Web publishing compelling&mdash;the
ability to incorporate audio and animation&mdash;raises significant
copyright issues.  For the piano performance of the Bacewicz
piece, I hired Charles Abramovic to perform the piece, then came
to an agreement with him on a mutually acceptable fee in order
that I owned the right to put his performance on the Internet.
</p>
 
<p>[6.2] In order to scan the sketch material, I received permission
from the University of Warsaw.  In order to scan the score, I
received permission from Polskie Wydawnictwo Muzyczne (PWM).
Although this score is reprinted in James Briscoe&rsquo;s wonderful
Historical Anthology of Music by Women&mdash;requiring written
permission from Indiana University Press&mdash;the copyright rests
with PWM.
</p>
 
<p>[6.3] I commissioned an artist, Kathe Grinstead, to take the
photograph of the piano.  We agreed on a fee which would allow me
to publish her photograph on my site.  The students followed
similar procedures for their work.  They used photos and
performances of their own making in most cases, and received
permission to use the scores.  In the case of Rebecca Clarke&rsquo;s
manuscripts, the copyright rest with the student&rsquo;s father,
keeping those issues all in the family.
</p>
 
<p>[6.4] Information about copyright issues can be found at many sites.  
For my needs, I found the following two sites and their many links
to other sites to be the most useful:<br>
<br>
CETUS (Consortium for Educational Technology in University Systems)
An excellent resource for &ldquo;Fair Use of Copyrighted Works&rdquo; 
at: <a href="http://www.cetus.org/fairindex.html">http://www.cetus.org/fairindex.html</a> 
and: EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation)&rsquo;s &ldquo;Multimedia Law Handbook:  
A Practical Guide for Developers and Publishers&rdquo; at: 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/pub/CAF/law/multimedia-handbook">http://www.eff.org/pub/CAF/law/multimedia-handbook</a>
In particular, the discussion in EFF&rsquo;s handbook about 
popular myths might be especially relevant to us. Myth #2 reads
as follows:<br>
 <br>
    I don&rsquo;t need a license because I&rsquo;m using only a small<br>
    amount of the copyrighted work.<br>
  <br>
It is true that de minimis copying (copying a small amount) is not
copyright infringement. Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to tell where
de minimis copying ends and copyright infringement begins.  There are no
&ldquo;bright line&rdquo; rules.
</p> 
 
<p>[6.5] Copying a small amount of a copyrighted work is
infringement if the copied section is a qualitatively substantial
portion of the work.  In one case, a magazine article that
used 300 words from a 200,000-word autobiography written by
President Gerald Ford was found to infringe the copyright on the
autobiography.  Even though the copied material was only a small
part of the autobiography, the copied portions were among the
most powerful passages in the work.  Copying any part of a
copyrighted work is risky.  If what you copy is truly a tiny
and nonmemorable part of the work, you may get away with it (the
work&rsquo;s owner may not be able to tell that your work incorporates
an excerpt from the owner&rsquo;s work).  However, you run the risk of
having to defend your use in expensive litigation.  If you are
copying, it is better to get a permission or a license (unless
fair use applies).  You cannot escape liability for infringement
by showing how much of the protected work you did not take.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section7"><b>7. Footnotes and Bibliography</b></a></p>
  
<p>[7.1] Footnotes and bibliography are added as end material to the
text in the left-hand frame.  The students designed some
interesting cross-referencing footnotes and bibliographic
references which are made possible because of the linking
features.  One can easily skip to and from footnotes,
bibliography, and main text without going outside the same
left-hand frame document.
</p>
 
<p>[7.2] Those who are comfortable with HTML tagging can set up the
footnote links exactly the way you link anything within the same
document.<br>
 <br>
For footnote &ldquo;1&rdquo; in the body of the text:<br>
 <br>
&lt;A NAME=&ldquo;(1)&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&ldquo;#footnote1&rdquo;&gt;(1)&lt;/A&gt;<br <br>
For the footnote itself, with a link back to the body of the text:<br>
 <br>
&lt;A NAME=&ldquo;footnote1&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;A HREF=&ldquo;#(1)&rdquo;&gt;1. Rosen, Judith,&lt;/A&gt; &lt;I&gt;Grazyna Bacewicz: Her Life
and Works,&lt;/I&gt; Polish Music History Series, vol. 2 (Los Angeles:
University of Southern California, 1984), 15.&lt;/P&gt;
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section8"><b>8. Cosmetics &mdash; Varying Typefaces, Photos, etc.</b></a></p>

<p>[8.1] Claris Home Page has a user interface which looks like most
word processing applications, making it extremely easy to add
bold, italics, different sized type, etc.  Photos are scanned the
same way musical scores are scanned.  If you save a photo as a
GIF, that GIF icon can be dragged and dropped into Home Page and
appear exactly where you want it.  You can then easily center or
move the photo.  All the HTML tagging is added automatically.
Other nice design features, such as borders and tables, are done
equally easily with Home Page.  Separate explanatory windows
appear for tables, for example.
</p>
 
<p>[8.2] However, do not assume that you can set the exact look of
the typeface itself.  Users can control the typeface in their WWW
browsers.  There are other ways that Web publishing does not yet
match all the features of print publishing.  One forfeits many of
the same things that one forfeits with e-mail&mdash;in the case of my
essay, dots over &ldquo;Z&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the carets over scale-degree numbers,
superscripts for footnotes, and so forth.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section9"><b>9. The Quick Time Movies</b></a></p>

<p>[9.1] This is where the crunch comes, both in the learning curve
and in expensive software.  Several software packages are
available for creating Quick Time movies; I can only speak about
using Macromedia Director and SoundEdit.  If you already have
access to a copy of Director, I would be happy to mail you my
template for the Quick Time movie on a Macintosh floppy disk.  If
you look at my skeletal movie you will see how to substitute your
own audio and pages of score.
</p>
 
<p>[9.2] The design for a synchronized musical example works as &ldquo;a
movie within a movie.&rdquo;  I first saw this design when Sasha Magee
(sashax@igc.org of Infrared Communications,
<a href="http://www.eline.com/Infrared/Shocked/index.html">http://www.eline.com/Infrared/Shocked/index.html</a>) used it as part
of my paper/demonstration at the joint meetings of SMT/AMS/CBMR
in New York City (&ldquo;Networking:  Initiatives in Music Scholarship
on the Internet,&rdquo; November 3, 1995).  I then redesigned his
format for use on the Web with the help of a tutor, Glynda V.
Cotton.
</p>
 
<p>[9.3] First, one needs the audio.  Part of Director 4.0 is
SoundEdit, which I use to format the audio.  In the case of the
Bacewicz piano sonata, I started with a 54 MB AIFF sound file
(which is too large even for me!).  The original recording was
made with stereo sound, at 16 bits and 44 kHz.  For my ears, the
compromise of keeping 16 bits but reducing to mono and 11 kHz
translates best for listening through a computer while reducing
the size of the file.  After changing the audio format in
SoundEdit, one can then save the audio file as a Quick Time
movie.  Import this audio Quick Time movie as one member of a
larger Director movie.
</p>
 
<p>[9.4] Second, one needs to import the pages of musical score.  As
mentioned above, scanned images of the score can be imported into
a Director movie as GIFs.  Just as the Quick Time audio &ldquo;movie&rdquo;
is one member within a larger Director movie, each page of the
score is its own member as well.
</p>
 
<p>[9.5] Third, one synchronizes the audio with the pages of score.
Director uses a one-second counter.  Time by one-second intervals
when you need to &ldquo;flip the page.&rdquo;  The animation you create will
synchronize the score with the audio.  Save the larger Director
movie as a Quick Time movie.  In the example above the Quick Time
movie was saved as &ldquo;example1.mov&rdquo;.
</p>
 
<p>[9.6] Last, one links the Quick Time movie with the text.  If you
are using Home Page, you simply import the Quick Time movie into
the right-hand frame.  If you are comfortable with HTML tagging,
use the tagging in the section above entitled &ldquo;Links to Musical
Examples.&rdquo;
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section10"><b>10. Conclusion</b></a></p>

<p>[10.1] My enthusiasm for Web publishing is inspired by the hope
that we can add the &ldquo;music&rdquo; to music theory publishing.  My
belief is that when the barriers to adding audio to our work are
low enough, we will enter a new era in our field.  When
high-quality audio is synchronized with musical examples, I
believe that music theory publishing can be enhanced in many
ways.  I also have another hope.  This platform can bring
high-quality recordings of new music (in the case of my
interests, little-heard music by women composers) to a wider
audience.  I look forward to any questions or feedback (or
contributions to the site!) you may have.</p>
