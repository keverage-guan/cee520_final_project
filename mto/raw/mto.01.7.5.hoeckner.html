Cone&rsquo;s most recent article about Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Dichterliebe</i>, &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s Love or

that is coextensive with the persona of the actual composer of the song.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Drawing on Novalis&rsquo;s Romantic hermeneutics, my modification proposes a &ldquo;multiple 
persona&rdquo; with an independent poetic voice, exemplified in a reading of Schumann&rsquo;s

<p>[1.1] The opening song of Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Heine Liederkreis</i>, Op. 24 
(<b>Example 1</b>)<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> presents a man waiting for 
the woman he loves. In this state of expectation, his life has turned upside down: 
hopeful day-dreaming and nightly laments alternate. The chiasmus of &ldquo;morgens/abends&rdquo; 
versus &ldquo;Nacht/Tag&rdquo; links the poem&rsquo;s ending with its beginning and the simple present 
tense keeps the speaker&rsquo;s emotional ups and downs in a state of perpetual circularity. 
The music seems simple and straightforward. A walking bass in the accompaniment 
alternates with chords doubling the melody. Only in the second line from the end, 
&ldquo;tr&auml;umend wie im halben Schlummer,&rdquo; does the vocal line depart from the upper voice 
of the chordal accompaniment to rise twice to a syncopated E5 (measure 30).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
The top notes of the three preceding phrases, B4, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5, and D5&mdash;the circled notes 
in Example 1&mdash;have led stepwise to this melodic highpoint, whose chromatic inflection 
to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5 in measure 32 ushers in a quick descent to the concluding vocal cadence on 
the tonic. In the postlude, however, the piano quickly regains the register of the 
vocal climax. In the third bar from the end, a group of eighth-notes encapsulates 
the top pitches of the first three vocal phrases. But the syncopated E5, now on 
the dominant, is surpassed by an <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 appoggiatura in the penultimate measure. The 
postlude then closes an octave above the voice.</p>
<p>[1.2] Given the guitar-like accompaniment, the protagonist of the song could 
be a singer creating his own text and music, whose individual phrase endings are 
punctuated with a half cadence and cadences to iii, IV, and I. While there is no 
real progress in the text&rsquo;s cycle of hope and disappointment, the gradually rising 
vocal line appears directed towards the upper tessitura, without, however, reaching 
the high tonic third, and falling instead back onto a cadence in the opening register. 
When the accompaniment is finally freed from vocal constraints in the postlude, 
it quickly regains, almost without effort, the register of the vocal line and finally 
reaches <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5, which, though only fleetingly touched upon and thus lacking full harmonic 
support, appears nevertheless as the melodic and expressive goal of the song. The 
overall melodic contour may be graphed analogously (though in an unorthodox way) 
to a Schenkerian <i>Zug</i> extending from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 and offering an alternative 
close an octave above the voice (see <b>Example 2</b>). Thus the instrumental 
postlude attains, however briefly, what the human voice had been unable to reach.</p>
<p>[1.3] Instead of projecting a single unified utterance, then, a subtle split 
occurs between the protagonist&rsquo;s three creative selves, for what he says differs 
from what he sings, and what he sings from what he plays. Indeed, hearing the song 
as a <i>multi-voiced</i> utterance, which includes the poetry as an independent 
voice, captures very well the protagonist&rsquo;s mixed feelings and unfulfilled desire. 
In isolation, his voices send contradictory signals, but taken together their incongruence 
carries the song&rsquo;s message: while the poetic voice shows the lover in limbo, the 
linear drive of the music seeks to break this cycle. The vocal self, however, fails 
to do so, returning to the point from which it began, so that the music could enter 
into an endless loop, analogous to the situation in the poem. It is the instrumental 
self that takes up the unspoken cause of the voice by closing an octave above in 
the upper tessitura&mdash;in a different sphere, as it were. Despite the structural downbeat 
on the tonic in measure 36 (which moments ago had been the dominant of the preceding 
G major), the protagonist seems to continue wandering, and proceeds to an alternative 
ending in measure 45, suggesting that the upper register provides a qualitatively 
different closure than the cadence an octave below. In other words, the linear progression 
in pitch space is as important as the cyclical return of pitch class. As a result, 
the song both suggests closure and remains open&mdash;which would seem quite appropriate 
for the beginning of a song cycle.</p>
<p>[1.4] This hearing of the opening song from Schumann&rsquo;s Op. 24 serves a twofold 
purpose. It serves first as the impetus for revisiting, reexamining, and refining 
the concept of a musical persona in the well-known and influential approach to the 
analysis and interpretation of romantic art song by Edward T. Cone. I will do this 
in the second part of the paper by exploring further the above analysis and by drawing 
on romantic hermeneutics, specifically the notion of a plural voice, which I will 
call multiple persona. This concept will then, in the third part of this paper, 
open up a venue from the analytical-hermeneutic model to a broader critical reading, 
which seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between poetry and 
music and cyclical structure in Schumann&rsquo;s largely neglected first song cycle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[2] <i>The Composer&rsquo;s Voice</i> Revisited</b></p>

<p>[2.1] To speak of &ldquo;voices&rdquo; in the analysis of song goes back to Edward T. Cone&rsquo;s 
1974 book, which has had a significant impact on music criticism in the last two 
decades.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> By using &ldquo;voice&rdquo; not merely 
in its narrower technical sense, Cone opened the door&mdash;at the time only a crack&mdash;to 
literary criticism, where the term can comprise the entire performative dimension 
of an artistic utterance. Meanwhile, that door has swung wide open,<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> 
with the <i>Lied</i> becoming the locus of increasingly esoteric experiments in 
the application of literary and critical theory analysis.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
Yet Cone&rsquo;s initial approach  remains a truly elegant hermeneutic device and 
valuable pedagogical tool for approaching the romantic art song, and perhaps other 
hybrid genres as well.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> An important 
modification of Cone&rsquo;s model may be in order, however. In fact, it is inspired by 
Cone&rsquo;s own attempt at refinement in an article on Robert Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Dichterliebe</i>, 
entitled evocatively, &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s Love or Composer&rsquo;s Love?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>&mdash;a 
question which Cone settled in favor of the composer. Hence our focus on what is 
sometimes nicknamed &ldquo;little <i>Dichterliebe</i>&rdquo;; and hence the title of the present 
essay, which suggests that we move beyond Cone&rsquo;s either/or logic and give the poetry 
a voice of its own, one that stands on an equal footing with the music.</p>
<p>[2.2] To recall: Cone&rsquo;s concept of a composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;voice&rdquo; is equivalent to the 
idea of a musical &ldquo;persona,&rdquo; a surrogate for the empirical composer, who projects 
&ldquo;the illusion of the existence of a personal subject&rdquo; behind or within a work of 
art.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> As a &ldquo;role&rdquo; assumed by the artist, 
a persona (originally a &ldquo;mask&rdquo; in ancient theater) suggests for Cone &ldquo;that all music, 
like all literature, is dramatic; that every composition is an utterance depending 
on an act of impersonation which it is the duty of the performer or performers to 
make clear.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Since there are two 
performers in accompanied song, Cone heard the composer speak with a &ldquo;double voice, 
through a musical persona that assumes a double guise&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>: 
an instrumental persona and a vocal-poetic persona. He called the latter simply 
&ldquo;vocal persona,&rdquo; because it expresses itself &ldquo;at least as much by melody as by speech, 
and as much by tone-color as by phonetic sound.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
In other words, &ldquo;the vocal persona adopts the original simulation of the poetic 
persona and adds another of his own: he &lsquo;composes,&rsquo; not the words alone, but the 
vocal line as well.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> In the romantic 
art song, Cone argued, &ldquo;the composer&rsquo;s persona governs words as well as music. The 
words, that is, have become a part of the composer&rsquo;s message, utterances of his 
own voice. In a sense, he composes his own text.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.3] The idea that the composer exercises complete creative control over the 
entire song, including the poetry, was the central problem of early nineteenth-century
<i>Lied</i> aesthetics.&nbsp; Goethe&rsquo;s preference for Friedrich Zelter&rsquo;s simple 
strophic settings of his poems over Schubert&rsquo;s elaborate through-composed <i>Ges&auml;nge</i> 
is the most well-known example.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
Since Cone preferred the romantic <i>Lied</i>, he has sided with Schubert on this 
issue, which explains his ruling in favor of the composer in &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s Love or Composer&rsquo;s 
Love?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Cone does so after revisiting 
an old problem that had preoccupied him in his book: whether or not protagonists 
of romantic art songs are conscious of their singing. Originally, Cone had assumed 
that they were not and that this would be the normal condition. Since many characters 
portrayed in poetic texts appear to be <i>speaking</i>, he proposed that &ldquo;the musical 
components, vocal and instrumental, [stem] from the subconscious levels.&rdquo; Although 
the protagonist is not conscious of singing or hearing the accompaniment, &ldquo;his subconscious 
both knows and hears.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> </p>
<p>[2.4] Returning to the issue, Cone still finds this division useful when approaching 
the complexity of, say, Wagnerian opera, but no longer for cases like Schumann&rsquo;s
<i>Dichterliebe</i>. Since the protagonist of Heine&rsquo;s poems is already portrayed 
as a singer who creates his own songs, Cone assumed that in Schumann&rsquo;s cycle, &ldquo;[t]he 
instrumental accompaniment directly conveys certain aspects of the musical consciousness 
of the vocal protagonist.&rdquo; Quoting from his book, he finds it no longer necessary 
to posit </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;a triad of personas, or persona-like figures, involved in the accompanied 
  song: the vocal, the instrumental, and the (complete) musical.&rdquo; According to that 
  analysis, &ldquo;the complete musical persona is to be inferred from the interaction 
  of the other two&rdquo;; I called it an <i>implicit persona</i>, or, &ldquo;as the 
  vehicle of the composer&rsquo;s complete message<nobr> . . . </nobr><i>the composer&rsquo;s persona</i>.&rdquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>But 
  when the accompaniment proceeds directly from the imagination of the protagonist, 
  a separate instrumental persona becomes superfluous, and therefore no complete 
  musical persona is to be &ldquo;inferred from the interaction of the other two.&rdquo; Instead, 
  my three original figures have collapsed into one: a unitary vocal-instrumental 
  protagonist that is coextensive with the persona of the actual composer of the 
  song<nobr>. . . . </nobr>My hope is that an interpretation based on the foregoing principles 
  might result in a closer and more sensitive relationship between voice and accompaniment 
  than would otherwise be possible. Singer and accompanist, instead of taking for 
  granted that each of them represents a unitary agent (to adopt the jargon of my 
  book), would try to hear the song-texture as composite; and they would determine 
  to what extent their parts could be made to coalesce in order to project a single 
  persona.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[2.5] Through this radical simplification of his original conception, Cone hoped 
to account for the &ldquo;essential identity&rdquo; of the two musical components in the majority 
of songs. Created by the same consciousness, the musical personae are, in fact, 
unified&mdash;one voice.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> But with his 
refined model Cone seems to have lost as much as he gained. True, if the protagonist 
of a song is, as in <i>Dichterliebe</i>, the singer of his own songs, it makes  sense to locate words and music in a single mind. Yet by collapsing the vocal 
and instrumental personae into a &ldquo;unitary vocal-instrumental protagonist,&rdquo; Cone 
gives up a powerful tool for hearing the voice and the accompaniment as distinctly 
different utterances nevertheless, even when they are &ldquo;inseparable components of 
a single invention.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> </p>
<p>[2.6] My proposal, then, is to keep the basic conception of Cone&rsquo;s earlier model, 
while accommodating his later modification: to adopt the notion of a single creative 
mind, while still hearing independent voices. What is more, where Cone heard a complete 
musical persona constituted by instrumental and vocal personae, I hear a triple 
voice, which includes a poetic persona that remains on a par with the musical ones. 
Even when a poem has been molded into a through-composed song; even when its words 
have lost the rhythm of their original meter; and even when its text has been altered 
by the composer: the poetic text still remains an independent component of a song. 
Even sung, the words assume their own dramatic agency within what may be called 
a composer-poet&rsquo;s multiple voice. </p>
<p>[2.7] One can find a precursor for the concept of a multiple persona as an interpretive 
tool in early Romantic hermeneutics. Novalis formulated it in this entry on &ldquo;Personenlehre&rdquo; 
from his poetic encyclopedia, <i>Das allgemeine Brouillon</i>, from the late 1790s:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A truly <i>synthetic</i> person is a person who is several persons at once&mdash;a 
  genius. Every person is the seed of an <i>infinite genius</i>. Though divided 
  into various persons it is nevertheless also capable of being a single person. 
  True analysis of a person as such produces several persons&mdash;a <i>person</i> can 
  only break up, divide, and dissolve into several persons<nobr>. . . . </nobr></p>
  <p>Every personal utterance belongs to a certain person. All utterances of the 
  person belong to the indeterminate (universal) personality and to one or several 
  personalities at the same time. I.e. an utterance as <i>human being</i>, <i>citizen</i>,
  <i>father</i>, and <i>writer</i> at the same time.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[2.8] The context for this passage is the early Romantic theory of the novel 
which was developed in Friedrich Schlegel&rsquo;s famous essay on Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Wilhelm 
Meiste</i>r.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Novalis&rsquo;s approach 
to the constellation of characters in a novel literally pre-&ldquo;figures&rdquo; the hermeneutic 
circle. A reader understands the plurality of characters that constitutes the novel 
as a product of a single organizing mind.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
Thus the creative genius and the congenial reader engage in reciprocal activities: 
while the former is synthetic, the latter is analytical.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
Novalis works out the performative and interpretive dialectic of genius in  another 
entry on &ldquo;Menschenbildungslehre&rdquo; (a term that resonates with the concept of education-as-formation 
in the eighteenth-century <i>Bildungsroman</i>). Here the musical dimension of the 
multitude of characters born out by a single narrating voice is most explicit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In order to develop the voice, a human being has to develop several voices&mdash;through this his organ becomes more substantial. Similarly, in order to develop 
  his individuality, he must assume several individualities and know how to assimilate&mdash;through 
  this he becomes a substantial individual. Genius. <i>Everything&nbsp; m a d e 
  by man</i> is <i>human</i>&mdash;or quod idem est a <u>part</u> of man&mdash;a human being. 
  (Science, Art, etc.) <sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as a human being divides only into viable entities that have a human face, 
so does a voice divide only into voices. The result is the paradox of several-persons-in-one, 
comparable to the Holy Trinity, which Cone had originally invoked in his book in 
order to illustrate the idea of a composite musical persona.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.9] The often numerous characters of a novel sometimes appear in song, say 
when a singer and accompaniment represent different (separate) characters&mdash;lover 
and beloved, poet and brook. We should nevertheless distinguish between the complex 
plurality of many characters in a novel and the more limited number of voices dwelling 
in the creative consciousness of a poet-composer. And there is, of course, a difference 
between a &ldquo;person&rdquo; and a &ldquo;persona.&rdquo; The former does not imply the distinction, common 
today, between author and what Wayne Booth called &ldquo;implied&rdquo; author.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> 
Still, even if we take into account the premises of idealist aesthetics, the religious 
implications behind Novalis&rsquo;s secularized exegetic model of the Holy Trinity, and 
the specifics of a particular genre: the idea of a multiple voice still offers a 
powerful heuristic tool that helps us to conceptualize the often paradoxical plurality 
of voices emerging from a single source. Thus, if the protagonist of a song appears 
as a poet-composer who creates both words and music, we may conceive of his poetic, 
vocal, and instrumental voices as separate entities: as different artistic &ldquo;selves&rdquo; 
inhabiting the same creative consciousness. </p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[3] The <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i> Reheard</b></p>

<p>[3.1] Let us return, then, from the hermeneutic model to interpretive practice 
and explore further how the idea of a multiple persona might deepen our understanding 
of Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i>. The idea of this exploration, however, is 
not to produce more analyses in the manner of the above close reading of the first 
song, but to follow up on how the special condition of the protagonist as projected 
through  the multiple personae affects the remainder of the cycle. Our view of 
other songs, therefore, is necessarily limited to looking at a few motives which 
tell, like <i>Dichterliebe</i>, the story of unrequited love. In both works, hopeful 
sentiments are dashed early on in the cycle, followed by various attempts to cope 
with the loss. Perhaps the most striking parallel between the two cycles is the 
ending: the disappointed lover&rsquo;s wish to bury his songs, which nevertheless seem 
to come to life again in the last number with the recapitulation of earlier music. 
For <i>Dichterliebe</i>, Schumann selected sixteen poems from the more than sixty 
that Heine had grouped together in his <i>Buch der Lieder</i> under the title &ldquo;Lyrisches 
Intermezzo.&rdquo; The nine songs of the <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i>, on the other hand, 
are identical with a collection of nine poems simply called &ldquo;Lieder,&rdquo; which thus 
retain the narrative sequence of Heine&rsquo;s original.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.2] As suggested above, a subtle incongruence between vocal melody, accompaniment, 
and poetry, of the various voices in the first song of the <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i> 
initiates an open-ended structure. This has ramifications for the rest of the cycle.&nbsp;Recall Schumann&rsquo;s repetition of the syncopated E5 in the vocal line, which highlights 
the verse &ldquo;tr&auml;umend wie im halben Schlummer&rdquo; (measures 29&ndash;32). This melodic repetition 
seems to spill over into the following line of text, where one finds a corresponding 
reiteration of &ldquo;tr&auml;umend,&rdquo; lacking in the original poem. This double repetition 
occurs over a transitional prolongation of G major&mdash;the local tonic before measure 
28 and the global subdominant again after measure 33. It is partly responsible for 
a less than convincing return to D major and thus helps to motivate the piano prelude 
to complete the job. It embodies the in-between state of the dreamer, who hopes 
for the fulfillment of his desire for love. This &ldquo;dream motive&rdquo; is, of course, not 
a leitmotiv in the Wagnerian sense, but its variants permeate the cycle and support 
its narrative structure (see <b>Example 
3a</b>). Indeed, the postlude can only partly fulfill the&nbsp;harmonic and 
melodic implications of the passage, since it involves neither the voice nor the 
text. This lack of agreement between the musical and poetic personae is analogous 
to the unfulfilled narrative desire for the denouement of the story, that is, the 
protagonist&rsquo;s imagined union with the distant beloved. The resulting tension has 
reverberations throughout the cycle that I want to examine now.</p>
<p>[3.3] After a stormy second song in B minor, in which the protagonist impatiently 
awaits a rendezvous with his beloved, the third song in B major begins with a transformation 
of the dream motif in the prelude. It thus returns to the premise of the yet unanswered 
declaration of love that was behind the protagonist&rsquo;s fluctuating utterance in the 
first first song. Now a variant of the characteristic figure of the E lowered to 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (now <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>) wanders through a circle-of-fifths progression (see <b>Example 4</b>
 and cf. Example 3a and c). But it is unclear 
what this is meant to say. Typical for many romantic song cycles, the intermittent 
narrative precludes knowledge of how much time elapsed after the second song and 
what happened in between. Because of the mode change from B minor to B major and 
the peaceful pace and atmosphere, the protagonist&rsquo;s meandering thoughts could be 
happy ones; but the text of the first stanza suggests that the migrating motive 
is the return of old dreams:&nbsp; </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I was walking under the trees<br>
  alone with my grief,<br>
  when the old dreaming came<br>
  and crept back into my heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b>. Robert Schumann, <i>Heine Liederkreis</i>, Op. 24: Melodic relation between No. 2 and 3</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="hoeckner_examples.php?id=4&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 5 thumbnail" src="hoeck_ex5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>In Cone&rsquo;s most recent model, these dreams would be integral to, and unified in, 
the protagonist&rsquo;s creative consciousness: music that he can <i>hear</i>. Yet the 
prelude suggests that the complexity of the creative act is well explained by the 
individual agency of the utterance. Here, composition is not necessarily a voluntary 
act; the protagonist&rsquo;s reminiscence seems to enter his heart like an involuntary 
memory (&ldquo;the old dreaming <i>came</i>&rdquo;). The dreams lead a life of their own, just 
as melodies with which we wake up are often impossible to get out of our ear during 
the day.&nbsp; Indeed, the return of previous music is conspicuous: apart from the 
dream motif in the prelude, the vocal line of the first stanza also draws upon the 
initial gesture of the previous song, its former haste now shuffling along (see <b>Example 5</b>). Moreover, when the 
protagonist refers to his dreams at the end of the stanza, the chordal accompaniment 
breaks open and the &ldquo;dream motif&rdquo; literally &ldquo;creeps into&rdquo; his singing as a painful 
exclamation on a non-syncopated high <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>; the melodic contour and rhythm (not the 
exact pitch content) of the gesture reverberates twice in the piano (III:11&ndash;13).<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
Thus, as if his creative powers had been weakened, the protagonist lives on memories 
that are part of himself and part not. In this respect, too, the song&rsquo;s eerie G-major 
middle section invokes the birds to whom he lost his poetic craft (and, by implication, 
his voice), symbolized by the &ldquo;golden word&rdquo; that they caught from his beloved:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A young girl came this way<br>
  and she sang it all day long.<br>
  It was then that we birds caught<br>
  the pretty, golden word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the potential disintegration that lurks behind the incongruence of multiple 
voices at the beginning of the cycle develops into a pathological condition of hallucinations, 
which are typical of the romantic individual, whose love-sickness is&mdash;for Heine 
at least&mdash;also a cultural malaise. </p>
<p>[3.4] Indeed, if the loss of love threatens the protagonist with the loss of 
creative control and mental sanity, the fourth song, &ldquo;Lieb&rsquo; Liebchen, leg&rsquo;s H&auml;ndchen 
auf&rsquo;s Herze mein,&rdquo; captures quite graphically how the dreams that &ldquo;crept&rdquo; back into 
his heart now wreak physical havoc on it. The off-beat accompaniment in the right 
hand lacks the bass notes of the first song (a disturbed heartbeat, as it were) 
and pounds against the dream motif that is no longer syncopated (see Example 3d). As a result, the 
rhythmic disjunction between vocal and instrumental personae at the end of both 
strophes is much more pronounced than in the first song (IV:15&ndash;17 and 35&ndash;37). What 
is remarkable, therefore, is how much the first song functions as both a material 
and a metaphorical matrix on which a central narrative strand of the whole cycle 
is constructed. Thus the fifth song, &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Wiege meiner Leiden,&rdquo; restores the 
simple figure of alternating eighth notes with the bass articulating the meter that 
we heard in the accompaniment from the first song. But now its duple time is transformed 
into the soothing rocking of triple time. This lends a feeling of calm and consolation 
to the theme of farewell in the fifth song, very well-suited for what was originally 
planned to be the last number of the first book of the cycle. The publisher eventually 
followed Schumann&rsquo;s wish to print it in one volume, but the internal division remains 
visible in the tonal plateau reached between the fifth and sixth songs. But 
as we will see below, the sense of closure and repose is illusory; it is merely 
a stage in the protagonist&rsquo;s ongoing journey, his restless &ldquo;wandeln&rdquo; and wandering. 
Schumann structured the key sequence of the cycle around a double trajectory of 
falling fifths partly alternating in mode: D&ndash;b&ndash;B&ndash;e&ndash;E (first part); E&ndash;A&ndash;d&ndash;D (second 
part). If the motion by fifths suggests a downward motion through tonal space, 
however, hearing the trajectory as the result of stepwise voice leading reveals&nbsp;that 
Schumann exclusively chose triadic connections that produce an exclusively upward 
motion, something that David Lewin has recently called &ldquo;upshift&rdquo; voice-leading.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> 
According to Richard Cohn, &ldquo;the intermediate resting point, E major, is exactly 
half-way between the two D-majors in terms of semitonal motion.&rdquo; Thus D+ up to E+, 
via b, B, and e, requires a total of six semitones upward: A&ndash;B (2 semitones), D&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
(1 semitone), <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;E/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;G (1 + 1 semitones); G&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (1 semitone). Then, for the next 
group of songs E+ to D+, via A and d, requires a total of six further upward semitones: 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;A/B&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (1 + 2 semitones), E&ndash;F/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;D (1 + 1 semitones), F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (1 semitone).<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> 
As a result, the final D major is &ldquo;higher&rdquo; than the initial one&mdash;a fact that will 
be of significance when we consider the return to material from the opening song 
in the last song of the cycle.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>.

<p>[3.5] On the tonal plateau in the middle of the cycle, then, two songs of farewell 
and departure are juxtaposed, but their emotional and gestural character could not 
be more different. The fifth song articulates the point in the emotional journey 
at which the protagonist seems ready to leave the site of his sad memories behind, 
not without a sense of sweet nostalgia, which emerges from the strophic stanzas 
1, 2, 4, and 7 (the last being a recapitulation of the first). These stanzas give 
a sense of closure: the long tonic pedal with which they begin is rounded off by 
the emphatic tonic cadences on the &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo; salutes, whose repetition is lacking 
in the original poem, but supports here the musical refrain. At the same time, feelings 
of anger and pain disrupt the reconciliatory retrospective, suggesting restlessness 
and failure to leave the past behind. Given the link to the accompaniment of the 
opening song, the melodic profile of the strophic stanzas is conspicuous in its 
gradual ascent to E5, by now surely a referential pitch in the cycle.&nbsp;A liminal 
remainder and reminder of the dream motif, this E5 returns almost obsessively, piercing 
the ear at the emotional highpoint of the song, which occurs toward the end of 
the section in which the fifth and the sixth stanzas are elided. Here the voice 
dwells on E5 for nearly six measures, briefly touching on F5 as if in utmost strain 
(see <b>Example 6</b>). At no point, 
however, is the E5 supported by more than a fleeting tonic sixth chord, let alone 
prepared by a root-position dominant. While the many cadences on E4 emphasize closure 
with the &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo; refrain in the lower register, the frequent, but unstable, E5 
remains a reminder of a melodic pitch, which, in the overall trajectory of the cycle, 
was to go somewhere else: to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5. The protagonist may leave behind the place, but 
not the past.</p>
<p>[3.6] After this ambiguous sense of closure, we will finally examine the second 
half of the cycle. Here our newly-gained sense for the protagonist&rsquo;s multi-voicedness 
will help to elucidate the disturbing interplay of musical and verbal irony, itself 
the trope of incongruence between literal and figurative meaning. Following the 
false farewell at the end of the first part of the cycle, the sixth song, &ldquo;Warte, 
warte wilder Schiffsmann,&rdquo; stages the actual departure in a sarcastic address to 
the once revered woman. The poem is all hyperbole, which culminates in characterizing 
her as the union of biblical Eva and mythological Eris (the goddess of discord):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Apples brought all our calamity,<br>
  with them Eva brought death.<br>
  Eris brought the flames of Troy,<br>
  you brought both, flames and death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The overstatement in the poetry correlates with a variety of musical figures: 
disjunct octave leaps and excessive runs in fast tempo, abrupt registral shifts 
(measures 52&ndash;53 and 99&ndash;103), repetition to the point of ridicule (measures 24&ndash;31 and 78&ndash;90); 
tritones in the melody set to alternating dominant seventh chords a semitone apart 
(measures 36&ndash;40 and 44&ndash;48), vocal ellipsis (measures 55&ndash;65), and more. Since verbal irony 
often manifests itself as a deliberate deformation of a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; way of speaking, 
these musical devices, too, deviate sharply from the previous &ldquo;tone&rdquo; of the cycle. 
Thus the tritone leaps function as a caricature of the &ldquo;dream motif,&rdquo; which is blown 
out of proportion in the final verse (&ldquo;Du bracht&rsquo;st beides, Flamm und Tod&rdquo;). Here 
the motif&rsquo;s characteristic repetition ends climactically on a rising unresolved 
seventh, whose A5 is even the highest sung pitch of the entire cycle (see Example 3e). In sharp contrast 
to the extreme intensity of the vocal part, the piano then tapers off in the postlude 
with a sense of understatement, suggesting that the ironic interplay between voice 
and accompaniment are far from presenting an integrated persona, but one on the 
verge of complete disintegration. Perhaps the ultimate irony emerges when the grave 
matter of the song is sharply thrown in relief against its diminutive attribute 
&ldquo;Liedchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[3.7] In the seventh song, as a striking contrast, the protagonist, now traveling 
on the Rhine, peacefully contemplates the play of water. The vocal line, which follows 
the strophic arrangement of the poem, blends seamlessly into a self-sufficient lyrical 
piano piece, reminiscent of a suave barcarole. As the speaker paints a romantic 
idyll, poetry and music seem to be in perfect harmony. But the apparent integration 
of the poetry and music is <i>illusory</i>&mdash;just like the surface of the water. 
It does not at all reflect the gradual change of mood that leads in the last stanza 
to an analogy between the beloved and the river&rsquo;s bright surface but deadly depth:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Delightful on the surface, treacherous at heart,&mdash;<br>
  river, you are the image of my beloved.<br>
  She also has a friendly nod,<br>
  and an innocent and gentle smile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the poem, however, Heine&rsquo;s notorious ironic reversal is not made 
explicit: the sinister part of the analogy&mdash;the beloved&rsquo;s inner wickedness&mdash;has 
to be inferred. And there is no hint of it in the music either. Since Schumann had 
sometimes been criticized for such apparent lack of a musical response to Heine&rsquo;s 
poetic irony, Cone felt the need to stand up for the composer: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Dichter</i> inhabits a different world from that of his poetic 
  original: a world in which words give way to music as the primary vehicle of expression, 
  in which to speak is to sing</nobr>. . . .&nbsp; </nobr>We should therefore not expect the personality 
  of Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Dichter</i> to be the same as that of his purely poetic original.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This defense, however, loses its <i>raison d&rsquo;etre</i> when we allow for poetry 
to retain its own voice. Because the poem&rsquo;s irony remains in effect, the composer 
may choose not to match it musically. On the contrary, in &ldquo;Berg und Burgen schaun 
herunter,&rdquo; the irony unfolds precisely between the sarcasm of the poem and the enchanting 
lyricism of the music. As with the river, the harmful implications of the words 
lurk below the bright surface. Had E5 not been such an important pitch in the cycle, 
one might not even notice how much the voice dwells on it here, moving so smoothly 
to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 that the music appears oblivious to the ironic meaning behind the text, except, 
perhaps, when leading first to a cadence in the supertonic before reaching the tonic 
itself (cf. VII. measures 13&ndash;20 and <b>Example 
7</b> measures 37&ndash;44). That this is the &ldquo;image&rdquo; of the beloved, caught between dream 
and reality, is made clear in that the fourth stanza goes over the same passage 
drawing the conclusions from the first three stanzas. Singers sometimes color the 
last stanza with a &ldquo;darker&rdquo; or somewhat threatening tone, in order to let us sense 
the song&rsquo;s falseness.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> But this 
added effect would spoil the ironic disjunction between musical sweetness and textual 
bitterness. We  need neither blame nor defend Schumann when his protagonist does 
not put his music where his words are. Double talk may require a double voice.</p>
<p>[3.8] The music thus amplifies the verbal irony with its own means (as in the 
sixth song); or irony emerges only in contradiction with the text (as in the seventh 
song). The eighth song of the <i>Heine Liederkreis</i> resorts to yet another device, 
that of <i>parodia sacra</i>. Moving furthest beyond the expressive realm of the 
cycle, it produces the ironic effect by a shift in style. Withdrawn from the world 
and looking back on the burden of unfulfilled love, the protagonist seeks refuge 
in religion, which is not born out by the poem, but insinuated by the music, which 
sets it to the melody of the chorale &ldquo;Wer nur den lieben Gott l&auml;sst walten&rdquo; and 
thus gathers, like a congregation, all his different voices into a unified utterance.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>At first I almost wanted to give up<br>
  and I believed I could never bear it.<br>
  Yet I have born it;<br>
  but don&rsquo;t ask me: how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tone of the hymn would seem to answer the question &ldquo;Nicht wie?&rdquo; (set to a 
half-cadence), which is repeated at the end of the quatrain and calls, cleverly, 
the sincerity of the parody into question. And indeed, when the half-cadence resolves 
into the D major of the last song, a different answer emerges. At the point of utmost 
distance and alienation, the protagonist&rsquo;s instrumental identity suddenly breaks 
out into the emphatically pianistic idiom that brushes the questionable pietism 
aside.&nbsp;(The beginning of last song is reminiscent of Schumann&rsquo;s first Novelette, 
Op. 21.) Leaving behind the different ironic variants of aggressive attack, subtle 
sarcasm, and religious regression, the protagonist&rsquo;s original emotions &ldquo;erupt&rdquo; to 
re-collect his scattered creative selves into one genuine voice:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With myrtles and roses, lovely and fair,<br>
  with fragrant cypresses and spangled gilding<br>
  I would adorn this book like a shrine<br>
  wherein to bury my songs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[3.9] The passionate call for the burial of his songs together with his love 
parallels the final song of <i>Dichterliebe</i>, where the songs are buried at the 
bottom of the ocean, only to rise from their grave in the famous postlude (itself 
a recapitulation of the postlude from the twelfth song, where flowers gave voice 
to the unspeakable sorrow of the silent protagonist). As has often been noted,
<i>Dichterliebe</i> closes in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>)&mdash;one possible dominant of the tonally ambiguous 
first song (which invokes both A major and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> minor). Thus the protagonist is not only 
conscious of having composed a corpus of songs which are capable of leading an afterlife 
of their own, but tonal cyclicity supports narrative cyclicity. In this respect, 
the <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i> is even more explicit, and its interpretive and critical 
ramifications are suggestive. Here the songs are not buried in the ocean, but in 
a book. The tome becomes a tomb, past passion frozen into print. Just as Romanticism 
newly negotiated the dichotomy between speech and writing, the corpus of songs becomes 
a corpse, foreshadowing, <i>avant la lettre</i>, the notorious association in deconstruction 
between death and writing. Still in the spirit of romantic utopia, however, the 
&ldquo;spirit of love&rdquo; can revive the body, like the divine <i>pneuma</i> that once breathed 
life into a clump of clay. The ultimate&nbsp;test, however, is whether the &ldquo;book 
of songs,&rdquo; brought alive, will be able to do better than the composer-poet himself; 
whether the story will be more moving than the teller; whether the letters imploringly 
looking at the beloved will speak more eloquently than the eyes themselves. </p>

<p>[3.10] Nowhere, perhaps, is this look more poignant than in vision of pastness 
becoming presence, or distance becoming nearness, during the fourth stanza, when 
the music returns to the first song. Only now, in a final transformation of the 
dream motif, both musical personae and the voice of poetry come together, suggesting&mdash;unequivocally&mdash;how 
the dream of requited love might be fulfilled. Only now, the non-syncopated double 
gesture B4&ndash;E5 leads directly to an <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 on the downbeat that is supported by the tonic 
harmony (see Example 3f and <b>Example 8</b>).&nbsp;Only now the 
desire for love, first articulated in the incongruence between poetry and 
music in the first occurrence of the dream motif, which initiated and sustained 
the narrative desire throughout the cycle, is&mdash;momentarily&mdash;resolved in the emphatic 
declaration to the &ldquo;sweet love in distant land.&rdquo; Taking back all the bitterness 
for a brief instant, this declaration is a paradigmatic example of Romantic transcendence: 
no less a dream than during the first song, but it is a dream that articulates its 
attainment&mdash;one that the beloved should read, would hear, and might understand.</p>
<p>[3.11] True, the protagonist&rsquo;s hope is that his sad story, by being told, will 
ultimately be undone; that by closing the gap between the first and the last song, 
it will overcome the emotional and physical distance between him and his beloved.&nbsp;True also, that his wish remains the very dream that it was from the very beginning. 
As in <i>Dichterliebe</i>, the illusion is only fleeting, the conceptual and corporeal 
unison of the three voices breaks apart. The final stanza wants to retreat from 
the achieved <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 and falls back onto a cadence in the lower register; and the postlude 
closes like an exhausted reflex of the prelude with a diminished seventh, whose 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> harks back to the D-minor chorale (and perhaps the upward leading <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> in the postlude 
of the first song), as if to stall forever the upward progression of the cycle. 
But once at least we were to believe that love was both the composer&rsquo;s and the poet&rsquo;s. 
This, however, we can hear only if we lend an ear both voices: those of music <i>
and</i> poetry.</p>

a practice not at all untypical for Schumann, as many of his songs including <i>
Dichterliebe</i> were premiered by women. If sung by a tenor or baritone, the registral 
shift would of course take place an octave lower, but still maintain the difference 
between a low and a high vocal register. [Ed.: The accompanying MIDI files 
realize the vocal part in the male register.]</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">Edward T. Cone, <i>The Composer&rsquo;s Voice</i> (Berkeley: University

convincingly demonstrate 
the limitations of Cone&rsquo;s approach in complex cases such as von Schweinitz&rsquo;s cycle, 
a male composer setting autobiographical poems by a female poet. Ruth Solie has 
addressed the same problem in &ldquo;Whose Life? The Gendered Self in Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Frauenliebe</i> 
Songs,&rdquo; in <i>Music and Text: Critical Inquiries</i>, ed. by Steven Paul Scher, (Cambridge:

Schumann probably used the first edition from 1827. See Rufus Hallmark <i>The Genesis

<i>Robert Schumann&rsquo;s Song Cycles in the Context of the Early Nineteenth-Century 
&ldquo;Liederkreis&rdquo;</i> (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 1981), 262ff, points out that 
an early reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</i> criticized the unevenness 
of the <i>Heine-Liederkreis</i>, stemming in part from the &ldquo;light&rdquo; character of 
the first song. Recent analytical studies of Schumann&rsquo;s song cycles include: David 
Neumeyer, &ldquo;Organic Structure and the Song Cycle: Another Look at Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Dichterliebe</i>,&rdquo;

5&ndash;28.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">As the anonymous reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine Musikalische 
Zeitung</i> 44 (1842), 33, remarked: &ldquo;The beautiful quiet song flies by like a dream 
image, in order to transport again into dreaming&rdquo; (Der sch&ouml;ne ruhige Gesang schwebt

on triadic connections and voice-leading directionality &ldquo;Square Dances with Cubes,&rdquo;
<i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 42 (1998), 283&ndash;96. In this context, it will be useful 
to point out that in <i>Dichterliebe</i> the trajectory of voice leading between 
triads is upward for the most part, but Schumann seems to imbue the succession of 
keys with a more complicated double trajectory that emerges from the tonal ambiguity 
of the first song (f&#x266f;/A), and is pursued through a series of minor keys (b e a d 
g) and major keys (A D G C), where mode matches mood. Significantly, the double 
trajectory is interrupted by the ironic eleventh song (&ldquo;Ein Juengling liebt&rsquo; ein
