<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Lee Rothfarb, General Editor of <i>MTO</i>, has graciously offered me
space for a response to Professor Morse&rsquo;s open letter published in <i>MTO</i>
3.3. I thank Professor Morse for his willingness to allow my response
to appear one issue later and for the time he took to write his
letter.  I have received a number of private supportive emails from
other theorists, but Morse has been the only person willing to offer a
public, and fairly negative response.  Our small professional
community (in contrast to the size of the American Psychological
Association, for example) carries different possibilities for
long-term animosities when we theorists disagree.  I find Morse&rsquo;s
objection to my article well within the boundaries of good-natured
professional disagreement; I hope that our colleagues have similar
reactions.  Because the space offered me is for an &ldquo;essay-like&rdquo;
response, not another article, I will discuss Morse&rsquo;s points according
to their numbering in <i>MTO</i> 3.3, and suggest that readers have a copy of
his writing at hand as they read my response.<p>

[2] Regarding Morse&rsquo;s [1]: &ldquo;Rather than<nobr> . . . </nobr>escalate the anger which so
plainly inspired the piece<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;  I have no sense of having written the
article in anger.  I try not to assign emotions to others until they
have first proclaimed them, thus observing parameters of reciprocal
feminist discourse.  Those who know both me and my writings know that
when I write or speak in anger, I use a tone in which I am explicit
about such anger.  When I try to recall my emotions when writing the
<i>MTO</i> article, I remember more a sense of amused exasperation with
theorists whom David Lewin describes as &ldquo;old silverbacks.&rdquo;  His uses
the term to portray theorists who sit around waiting to be groomed by
their graduate students.  His definition is not gendered, so women
theorists can be old silverbacks as well as men.  Indeed if his
description is used as a metaphor, &ldquo;old silverbacks&rdquo; are defined by
their attitudes rather than their ages.  Might these attitudes include
theorists who cling grimly to syllabi that could be improved by
updating and expansion?  There are theorists who would rather fight
than switch, to quote an old cigarette commercial.<p>

[3] Regarding Morse&rsquo;s [2]: &ldquo;I was neither outraged nor shocked by what
you wrote, but only saddened<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;  As indicated in the previous
paragraph, I was not writing to shock or outrage, but to inform and
offer alternatives.  Morse is certainly entitled to feel sad; I wish
he had given a more detailed explanation for his sadness? &ldquo;&mdash;I learned
nothing from what you said.&rdquo; I assume that Morse has additional
references of women composers, which I asked to be supplied to the
readership, since I acknowledged in paragraph [28] of my original
article the need for expansion of the article&rsquo;s information.
Professor Morse, will you please supply your references to us?<p>

[4] Morse&rsquo;s [2] continued: &ldquo;Finally, the use of scholarly discourse
for &lsquo;political&rsquo; provocation is near to a hallmark of our age.&rdquo; This
has a longer tradition than just &ldquo;our age.&rdquo; At least in part, Socrates
drank hemlock prescribed by his culture and Hypatia&rsquo;s flesh was
scraped from her bones by early Christians due to the political
provocations of their scholarly discourse.  Was either of them so
naive as to have considered their scholarly discourse as apolitical?
(I prefer to remain a music theorist; my kids are explicit in their
lack of desire for a martyr/mother.)<p>

[5] Regarding Morse&rsquo;s [3]: &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>the weariness of all-too-familiar
harassment,&rdquo; I am unsure why Morse considers himself harassed.  The
four theorists whose books motivated my article did not respond with
charges of harassment when I contacted them well before submitting my
original article with a synopsis of what I intended to write, offered
them space to respond, and gave them the opportunity to read the
finished manuscript before I submitted it.  If Morse considers himself
harassed&mdash;his [1] reads, &ldquo;I cannot find another way to reply than
personally&rdquo;&mdash;I wish he had been more explicit in defining his sense of
harassment.<p>

[6] Morse&rsquo;s [4]: &ldquo;Give a reader or listener no room for creative
response<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo; This charge perplexes me.  Paragraphs [18], [19], [20],
[21], [23], [28], and [30], among others, ask for reader response.
These questions were phrased so that responses of any sort could be
offered as creative.<p>

[7] Morse&rsquo;s [5]: &ldquo;You can hardly have expected a measured,
pipe-smoking discussion<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo; Here we agree.  I spent several years
learning aural neuroanatomy with Professor Earl Schubert of Stanford
Medical School.  Unless newer measurements have arisen, human behavior
most associated with early deafness is tobacco use.  I anguish as I
record so many nicotine addicted, hard-of-hearing folk musicians
through their clouds of pipe, cigar or cigarette smoke.  &ldquo;Pipe-smoking
discussion&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t measured: it&rsquo;s self-destructive.<p>

[8] Morse&rsquo;s [5]: &ldquo;I am not convinced that these anthologists have
willfully neglected women composers.&rdquo; Nor am I; nor are they.  I
thought the general point of my article was that the exclusion of
women composers from anthologies or texts was not deliberately planned
by anyone.  With all good intentions, women composers have been
excluded from consideration by music theorists, in contrast to
publications such as <i>Early Music America</i> 3.1 (Spring 1997), where
much of the issue is devoted to early music written by women.  History
and English literature have devoted consideration to women&rsquo;s work in
those fields; musicology and men musicologists have for years
researched women composers and their music.  As an example, my
classmate, Professor Stewart Carter, wrote his 1981 dissertation on
the music of Isabella Leonarda.  I can think of no equivalent theory
dissertation by a man on music written by a woman composer.  Perhaps
someone can enlighten us.<p>

[9] Morse&rsquo;s [5], further: He uses the term &ldquo;gender&rdquo; where I think the
term &ldquo;sex&rdquo; would be more accurate.  Sex is generally defined by
chromosomal identification, while gender is defined at least in part
by the complex interaction of culture and sex.  To minimize space, I
collapsed sex-gender terms in my article.  I wish I had clarified this
at its beginning, especially in view of public reports now emerging on
long-term reconsideration of Money&rsquo;s sex/gender work at Johns Hopkins
University.  I chose women composers who at some point in their lives
publicly identified themselves as women, no matter what their public
or private gender role complexities.  I omitted discussion of 
self-identified 
gay and lesbian composers as well
as composers who may have presented one identity to certain groups and
other identities to others.<p>

[10] The complexities of sex/gender have been neglected too often by
music theorists.  In particular, in setting texts, composers ought to
pay greater theoretical attention to sex/gender.  For example, my
undergraduate analysis classes grapple with whether Schubert&rsquo;s
possible gay identity would provide any additional theoretical meaning
in his setting of &ldquo;Doppelgaenger.&rdquo; They consider Clara and Robert
Schumann&rsquo;s decision to publish lieder written individually by each of
them under Robert&rsquo;s name, and invite their colleagues to guess which
of them had written which lied.  But these are perhaps issues for
future research.<p>

[11] Morse&rsquo;s [8]: His choice of words is interesting: &ldquo;attacking,&rdquo;
&ldquo;complaint,&rdquo; &ldquo;denouncing,&rdquo; &ldquo;weary.&rdquo; There is an analogy in
<i>Humanities</i> 18.1, (May/June, 1997), 8&ndash;9, 41&ndash;48, in &ldquo;The Paradox of
Biography,&rdquo; by Pulitzer Prize winner Joan D. Hedrick (for her
biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe), where she quotes one of her
critics and gives her reaction: &ldquo;&lsquo;Here is a very good book, full of
anecdote, well-written, thoroughly researched.<nobr> . . . </nobr>Why, then, is it
so irritating? Why does the reader feel like hurling it across the
room?&rsquo; He complained, &lsquo;The men in the story hardly register at
all.<nobr> . . . </nobr>The book belongs entirely to spirited women<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rsquo; He&rsquo;s right.
The book belongs to the women and putting them in the center was a
conscious political choice.  But I didn&rsquo;t announce it or defend it; I
simply did it, leaving this poor fellow no recourse to rational
argument&rdquo; (page 48).<p>

[12] Do Morse&rsquo;s concerns parallel those of Hedrick&rsquo;s critic? Is he
uncomfortable with my concentration on women composers, their music,
its analysis and addition to basic theory studies? To me, reasons for
inclusion of history, literature and music written by women into our
studies are self-evident: they write good stuff.  Musicians like to
play interesting music; some music written by women is in the
performance canon.  Over forty years ago, I learned Cecile Chaminade&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Flute Concertino,&rdquo; not because it was written by a woman but because
every young flutist learned it.  When I was auditioning for
conservatory, the problem was how <i>not</i> to hear it, wafting as it did
from every flutist&rsquo;s practice room.<p>

[13] Morse&rsquo;s [8]: asks, &ldquo;If music analysis is a specific, coherent
procedure, what contributions to it does the factor of composer gender
offer?&rdquo;  With regard to his initial &ldquo;if&rdquo; clause: have we actually
decided on specific coherent procedures for music analysis? Is that
not the framework for much current analysis? For example, for any
given piece, what are the advantages of analyzing it as Boulanger,
Schenker or Schoenberg did, as Babbitt or Forte or Lewin does? To what
extent do their analytical procedures complement or conflict with one
another?  How do they provide us with better understanding of music,
no matter by whom it is written?  Until theorists agree on the first
clause, I will assume that the second, &ldquo;the factor of composer
gender,&rdquo; may offer something valuable, even central.  We will learn
after more of us have analyzed music written by women.<p>

[14] Morse&rsquo;s [8] comments on McClary&rsquo;s &ldquo;attempts&rdquo;: What is the effect
of McClary&rsquo;s being a musicologist, with a Ph.D. in musicology,
currently chairing Musicology at UCLA? She has employed some
theoretical methodology in her work, most of which stands central in
the decades-old tradition of feminist musicology.  Use of some music
theory methodology is characteristic of most musicologists, as is
musicological methodology&rsquo;s use by theorists.  Do we wish to
recollapse the musicology and music theory disciplines in the United
States into one? This was the case previously until about the time
that musicology engaged with feminism and poststructuralism, drawn
from its sister disciplines of literature, history and art.  There are
advantages to separation or recombination.  Until the latter is
decided on by all of our organizations, it seems reasonable that music
theorists recognize McClary as a musicologist, and apply theoretical
critiques of feminist music theory more to those of us who are
trained, credentialed and employed as feminist music theorists.  (And
if you can find such an individual I would certainly like to talk with
him or her as to how I and others might attain the same status.)<p>

[15] Morse&rsquo;s [10]: &ldquo;proto-soviet musicologists&rdquo; are outside of my
knowledge.  Does this refer to some of the ethnomusicologists who
built heavily on materialism, such as Charles Seegar in his later
days? &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>One&rsquo;s sacrosanct individuality<nobr> . . . </nobr>the principle of identity
itself.&rdquo; This seems extremely Eurocentric and phallocratic.  European
composers influenced by gamelan, such as Debussy, and the complexities
of African drumming and its long influence on U.S. music are old news.
Successful compositions throughout the twentieth century by both women
and men composers, such as Oliveros, Reich, Monk, Glass, and others,
build around the reciprocal submersion of individual into group and
group support of individual.  What music of the past half-century
(written post-1947) do you enjoy and play the most frequently, and get
most excited about its analysis? What are the relationships of
individual to group in music that you most prefer from this period?<p>

[16] Morse&rsquo;s [11] final paragraph: &ldquo;Although without anger, I took
what you said personally<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;  Great! What music by women composers
have you personally been analyzing, performing and teaching that you
think I should have included in my first article? &ldquo;You present a
version of scholarly conversation<nobr> . . . </nobr>deeply troublesome<nobr> . . . </nobr>since it sets
so little store by fairness and openness<nobr> . . . </nobr>so much on its own
rhetorical privilege.&rdquo;  Professor Morse is certainly entitled to his
opinion, and I defend his right to hold it, but now I am the one who
does not understand.  Perhaps he, or someone who does understand,
could explain the basis for this opinion? &ldquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>Your assurances that the
coming generations vastly outdo you in radicalism is depressing beyond
words.&rdquo; How is that?  Perhaps he is referring to my statement in
paragraph [28]: &ldquo;Our students are ahead of their teachers now, and we
might well run to catch up with them&rdquo;? When has this not been the
case, with students straining at conventions imposed? When one of my
students says, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m programming the Musgrave again but you know
how it is&mdash;you need something conservative that all the judges know on
a master&rsquo;s recital.&rdquo; Does this really &ldquo;sacrifice on the altar of
political intransigence<nobr> . . . </nobr>a sense of music of both women and men?&rdquo; Or
is this evidence of exciting new music performed by new generations,
who choose to know how the analytical skills we teach them can help
them be better creators and interpreters of music&mdash;music originated by
people who identify themselves as various sexes, genders, races,
ethnicities, whatever? Do we as theorists choose to assume
responsibility for ignoring characteristics in our analyses that
composers consider central to their lives?</p>
