associated with immature or regressive states. This view is reflected in music 
criticism and pedagogy, recast in aesthetic terms and it also reappears in 
cultural criticism, attacking repetition as a dangerous tool for social control. 
Defenses that have been mounted in favor of repetition seem inadequate in that 
they tend to recategorize certain repetitive practices as not-quite-repetition, 
rather than defend repetition <i>tout court.</i> This article uses examples from 
Electronic Dance Music (EDM) to provide an alternate approach to repetition that 
focuses on the experience of pleasure instead of a static attribution of 
aesthetic or ethical value. In particular, this is explored through three 
concepts:&nbsp; repetition as process, repetition as prolongation of pleasure, 
and process itself as pleasurable. Underlying these concepts is a formulation of 
pleasure first coined as <i>Funktionslust, </i>or &ldquo;function pleasure,&rdquo; 
reconceived here as &ldquo;process pleasure.&rdquo;</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[1] &ldquo;I LIKE THE TUNE, BUT IT&lsquo;S SO REPETITIVE.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></b></p>
<p>
[1.1] Why does this sentence make intuitive sense, even though the adjective 
&ldquo;repetitive&rdquo; has no modifier indicating a positive or negative evaluation? Much 
like adjectives such as &ldquo;monotonous,&rdquo; &ldquo;boring,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unoriginal,&rdquo; &ldquo;repetitive&rdquo; 
seems to come with a negative connotation built-in. Outside the realm of 
aesthetic criticism, however, repetitiveness can play seemingly positive roles. 
For example, it is central to memory formation as well as to redundant 
error-checking in data transfer protocols, and it plays a large role in 
pedagogy, childhood development, and pattern recognition in general.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> This 
connection to childhood learning, however, has at times worked against 
repetition, associating it with childlike behavior, underdeveloped 
consciousness, and regression.</p>
<p>[1.2] Returning to the humanities and social sciences, this interplay of 
developmental necessity and psychopathology surfaces in discourse as anything 
from unease to suspicion to outright hostility and, in turn, many attempts to 
rehabilitate repetition read like an apology or an awkward change of subject. It 
is my intention here to offer another rehabilitation&mdash;or, rather, a 
reevaluation&mdash;of repetition, which reads neither as apology nor sidestep. Rather 
than ponder whether repetition can be good and/or beautiful, I will focus on how 
repetition can generate pleasure&mdash;a question of performance and practice rather 
than ontology. To illustrate these practices of pleasurable repetition, I will 
turn to a number of musical examples taken from a genre most explicitly 
associated with repetitiveness: Electronic Dance Music (hereafter: EDM).</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[2] THE REPUTATION OF REPETITION</b></p>

<p>
[2.1] The reputation of repetition in various disciplines and discourses is far 
more complex than I had first let on; this complexity requires a return to 
history before moving on with my own theorizing. My work responds to the 
contributions of many previous writers and it will be easier to explicate my own 
positions after having reviewed those of other prominent figures in discourses 
on repetition. I use the plural form of discourse here because, as will soon 
become apparent, there are several discursive streams that address repetition, 
not all of which are in constant dialogue with the others. This discursive 
diversity, along with the broad scope of a concept such as repetition, makes a 
comprehensive and exhaustive recounting next to impossible; the following review 
is therefore necessarily selective and merely serves to briefly historicize 
repetition.</p>

<p>[2.2] Although I intend to foreground practice and experience in this paper, 
most discourse on repetition in the past has been keenly ontological. One 
salient exception to this trend is the work of Benjamin in his consideration of 
art and reproduction. In his essay, he argues that the aura of authenticity 
attached to a work of art is destroyed or liquidated when it can be easily and 
precisely reproduced. He argues that &ldquo;authenticity is outside 
technical...reproducibility&rdquo; and thus it is dependent on the failure of 
technology.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> (As a side note: this puts an interesting spin on post-digital or 
&lsquo;glitch&rsquo; music, where failing technology is part of the aesthetic.) From the 
perspective of a Marxist critique of cultural value, the liquidation of 
authenticity&mdash;or, rather, <i>bourgeois</i> authenticity&mdash;is not necessarily negative, 
and his stance on repetition is correspondingly ambiguous.</p>
<p>[2.3] Admittedly, Benjamin and I are not frying the same proverbial fish. He is 
more concerned with the duplication of complete works and the impact that has on 
their exchange value, while I am more concerned with repetition internal to 
musical performances and their aesthetic value. Nonetheless&mdash;if I can run with 
the metaphor&mdash;these fish swim in the same pond; the fields of inquiry overlap 
and writers publishing in spaces closer to mine have drawn on his arguments. 
Moreover, they often rely on an active re-interpretation (misreading?) of his 
argument: the threat to authenticity is no longer the repeatable artwork, but 
the <i>repeating </i>one (and the stakes appear to run beyond authenticity).</p>

<p>
[2.4] After Benjamin, one of the most often cited and recited critiques of 
repetition comes from the realm of psychology and psychoanalysis. The work of 
developmental psychologists often considers repetition as a learning behavior 
essential to childhood development. However, this has become a liability for 
repetition as some writers have made this connection into a rigid one-to-one 
mapping. Proceeding from this logic, repetition is only suited for didactic 
situations; in any other context it becomes childish, immature and regressive. 
This idea is perhaps best summarized in a quote by Susan McClary, who is 
paraphrasing Adorno paraphrasing Schoenberg interpreting Freud: &ldquo;if we 
understand a piece of music as an allegory of personal development, then any 
reiteration registers as regression&mdash;as a failure or even a refusal to keep up 
the unending struggle for continual growth demanded for successful 
self-actualization&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.5] This particular chain of writers is quite apt, as Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings on 
repetition seem to be informed at some level by Freud&rsquo;s interpretation of 
repetitive behavior; in turn, Adorno seems to take his view of musical 
repetition from Schoenberg and that of the psychological implications from 
Freud. Although the foregoing quote from McClary neatly summarizes his most 
widely circulated position, I shall trace Freud&rsquo;s work on both pleasure and 
repetition in some detail. This is not only because many of the scholars 
mentioned below draw on his work, but also because I will be drawing on the work 
of one of his contemporary critics for a model of repetition and pleasure in the 
following section (see [3.3]).</p>
<p>[2.6] Although Freud&rsquo;s theories are often dealt with as a synchronic whole, they 
in fact developed and changed over time; for our purposes, the most important of 
these changes was the &ldquo;turning of 1920&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Before writing
<i>Beyond the Pleasure 
Principle,</i> Freud had believed that all human behavior could be explained by the 
&ldquo;pleasure principle&rdquo;: that all actions were set in motion by an initial &ldquo;unpleasurable 
tension&rdquo; and that these actions tended toward relaxing this tension through a 
production of pleasure or a reduction of unpleasure.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> In this book, however, 
Freud rejected this as too simplistic; it did not explain why humans sometimes 
subjected themselves to unpleasure&mdash;whether voluntarily or compulsively. He then 
added a second principle, the &ldquo;reality principle&rdquo;: the postponement of immediate 
pleasure (or the toleration of immediate unpleasure) as a step towards a more 
distant and indirect pleasure. However, this principle did not explain what 
Freud called &ldquo;repetition compulsion,&rdquo; which came from the observation of 
repetitive children&rsquo;s games such as <i>Fort-Da</i> (similar to &ldquo;Peek-a-boo&rdquo;). Freud 
rejected the theory that such games aimed at a mastery over the mother&rsquo;s 
absence, instead preferring a mastery of a different kind. By his 
interpretation, repetition was related to an ego instinct that sought to restore 
an earlier state of inertia&mdash;a pre-organic state of stillness that can only be 
truly fulfilled in death. Freud named this instinct <i>Thanatos,</i> the death 
instinct, against which he also erected its antagonist <i>Eros,</i> the life 
instinct; this division of instincts came to replace his previous ego/sexual 
division. It was this connection between repetition and the death instinct that 
enabled Freud to explain why some of his patients felt compelled to repeat past 
traumas in their current lives (i.e. repetition compulsion). The &ldquo;regressive&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;retrograde&rdquo; character that Freud saw in the death instinct made repetition not 
a process of psychological development, but the mark of an immature or 
underdeveloped ego.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.7] Apparently drawing on Freud, Schoenberg often depicts his ideal listener 
as a &lsquo;wakeful and trained&rsquo; mind; one that has no wish to be insulted by having 
the same musical idea presented to him repeatedly.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> However, Schoenberg also 
acknowledges in <i>Die Grundlagen der musikalischen Komposition </i>that 
&ldquo;comprehensibility in music seems to be impossible without repetition&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> As 
Andreas Jacob has noted in his paper on this issue, Schoenberg displays a 
certain unease or conflictedness with regards to repetition most likely arising 
from this collision of philosophical ideals and compositional practicalities.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.8] While Schoenberg&rsquo;s concerns about repetition resided mostly in its effect 
on the individual listener, Adorno also placed repetition in the broader context 
of culture (industry) and society. Although Adorno&rsquo;s commentary on repetition is 
scattered among his writings and somewhat inchoate we can organize them around 
issues of standardization and regression. Generally speaking, Adorno&rsquo;s 
standardization-critiques tended to focus (like Benjamin) on the repetition of 
entire art objects, while his regression-critiques tended to focus on repetition 
as a formal, intra-opus process. Adorno identifies a process of standardization 
in repetitive cultural forms through a twofold mapping of (capitalist) 
industrial production and marketing onto artistic production: <i>part 
interchangeability</i> (or <i>modular design</i>) and <i>pseudo-individuality.</i><sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> This 
latter term refers to the superficial details of a commodity, such as racing 
stripes on a car, that cause a consumer to prefer one over the other, even 
though they are essentially identical. In one instance, Adorno provides an 
example of how the culture industry enforces standardization and passive 
listening by using repetition to create a feeling of recognition, which 
eventually transmutes into the acceptance of a cultural object that would have 
otherwise been rejected.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Continuing in this same vein, Adorno critiques 
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; art music for its repetitive use of <i>topoi</i> 
(part-interchangeability), which composers covered with a patina of variation 
(pseudo-individuality).<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In this same passage, Adorno imagines the driving 
force behind such compositional standardization to be a stubborn, &ldquo;regressive 
repetition,&rdquo; which leads us to Adorno&rsquo;s second set of criticisms against 
repetition.</p>
<p>[2.9] As the term &ldquo;regressive repetition&rdquo; implies, Adorno&rsquo;s notion of repetition 
as regression is informed by a Freudian psychoanalytic tradition. Although this 
regression sometimes seemed to imply a reactionary view of history as circular 
and thus foreclosing on rupture and revolution,<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> his lengthier use of 
repetition as regression in his critique of Stravinsky&rsquo;s work is 
psychoanalytically inflected.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> This psychoanalytic register is reinforced by 
the other vocabulary he uses to critique Stravinsky: catatonia, hebephrenia, 
infantilism, psychosis, fetishism, depersonalization, dissociation. Indeed, it 
appears that Adorno&rsquo;s strategy was to throw the entire psychoanalytic arsenal at 
Stravinsky&rsquo;s music, in the hope that something would stick; the result of this 
strategy is that each psychopathological term (including regressive repetition) 
appears briefly and without a great deal of elaboration on how he understands 
these disorders to work.</p>
<p>[2.10] In addition to Adorno&rsquo;s explicit reasons, Ingrid Monson suggests that his 
own life experiences under the burgeoning Third Reich might have led to a more 
immediate and emotional response to repetition. Perhaps he associated musical 
repetition with the rhythms of marching, and thus with militarism and 
fascism?<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> While I like the idea that Adorno was, indeed, a human with his own 
share of fears and neuroses, I do not think that his view of repetition arises 
purely from transference. In other words, we should not dismiss Adorno&rsquo;s 
critique simply because his tone of voice sometimes approaches panic. Rather, 
the explanatory power of Adorno&rsquo;s critiques rest on two points: </p>
<ol>
	<li>as regards 
standardization, the degree of power and causality one affords to the structural 
homology Adorno traces from musical form to social organization and the 
psyche;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> and </li>
	<li>as regards regression, the ability of Freudian-influenced 
models of repetition and infantilism to comprehend pleasure-generating musical repetition (see [3.2-3]). Monson nonetheless bolsters her argument with the 
suggestion that, in the shadows cast by Stalin and Hitler, the sort of 
participation and collectivity often implied by repetitive musical practices is 
itself suspect. For Adorno, joining into a system also perpetuates it, where the 
system is implied to be fascist or otherwise oppressive.</li>
</ol>
<p>[2.11] As we will soon see, this view of collectivity runs counter to those 
frequently found in anthropology and ethnomusicology. Nonetheless, Adorno&rsquo;s 
arguments are still used to great effect in popular music criticism, often 
employed by popular music critics themselves. Phrases such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all just the 
same song over and over,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not songwriting anymore, just studio 
production,&rdquo; echo these same Adornian critiques and fears of industrialization 
and mass mediation.<br>
<br>
[2.12] To a greater degree than the preceding discursive streams of cultural 
studies, critical theory and art criticism, music theory and analysis have 
historically aimed for objectivity, tending to avoid evaluative claims. While 
this statement is less tenable now as the landscape of theory changes, the 
ethical and evaluative questions asked of repetition still tend to be avoided in 
this field in favor of descriptive typologies.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Despite this overt avoidance 
of value statements, these typologies still offer some cultural commentary, even 
if indirectly. For example, Rebecca Leydon&rsquo;s typology of minimalist tropes 
includes six very interpretive types: Maternal, Mantric, Kinetic, Totalitarian, 
Motoric and Aphasic. While limits of space (and time) preclude a closer 
examination of these categories, it is worth noting that, according to Leydon&rsquo;s 
explication, most of these terms rely on an allegorical connection between 
repetition as a loss of musical syntax, and repetition as a loss of the musical 
subject (imagined here as the listener).<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> Since, in a postmodern context, the 
loss of the subject may not necessarily be a failure, her view is not as 
explicitly negative as that of others. Repetition remains a loss, however: a 
destructive rather than generative force.</p>
<p>[2.13] Nonetheless, this emphasis on how repetition works rather than what it is 
or how valuable it is informs my own intended focus on practice and performance 
rather than ontology. Although I still intend to address issues of politics and 
cultural value, music theory&rsquo;s focus on process is crucial to an effective 
reevaluation of repetition. Also crucial to this reevaluation is a consideration 
of more positive perspectives on repetition&mdash;views that can contrast the 
pessimistic and suspicious tone of much of the foregoing discourse. 
Ethnomusicology, through its anthropological lens, has provided some of the most 
cogent arguments for repetition, especially in the study of African and 
African-Diasporic expressive culture.</p>

<p>
[2.14] John Miller Chernoff&rsquo;s 1979 examination of West African music-making 
provides one of the earliest comprehensive explorations of repetition to be 
published under the ethnomusicological banner. He takes a largely optimistic 
approach, arguing that repetition allows for a more participatory mode of 
music-making and, in turn, that the interlocking layers of West African 
percussion use repetition to &lsquo;lock&rsquo; its participants into a musical 
instantiation of social relationships.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> Like Adorno, Chernoff sees 
collectivity in repetitive music, but instead maps this to a more benign 
<i>communitas,</i> whence individuality can arise without being alienated. This 
positive spin on participation has been furthered by the work of Charles Keil 
most notably, whose notion of &lsquo;participatory discrepancies&rsquo; relies on the 
ability of individuals to make personalized but compatible contributions to a 
communal, egalitarian groove.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.15] This homology between musical structure and social structure is a common 
trope in ethnomusicology, and it is not without its weaknesses. Steven Feld&rsquo;s 
essay, entitled &ldquo;Sound Structure as Social Structure,&rdquo; considers how the 
relatively egalitarian and classless features of Kaluli society may find 
resonance and rearticulation in their musical practice. While his argumentation 
remains largely in favor of this structural homology, he does address 
inequalities in both social and musical practice largely revolving around 
gender.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Ingrid Monson points this out when she uses the example of James 
Brown&rsquo;s band to show how a seemingly egalitarian musical practice nonetheless 
involves a division of labor and a corresponding division of power, money and 
prestige.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> Thus two useful insights can be taken from ethnomusicology:</p>
<ol>
	<li>that the collectivity often read into repetition can have positive possibilities 
as well as negative; and </li>
	<li>that the apparent structure of musical sounds does 
not always translate into social, political and economic realities.</li>
</ol>
<p>[2.16] From the earliest reports of the colonial encounter, rhythm and 
repetition have had a racial valence, doing &ldquo;work&rdquo; as a difference-making 
calculus of ethnic and racial others. It is little surprise, then, that 
questions of repetition surface frequently in studies of the African diaspora. 
This is especially appropriate for this literature review, which precedes an 
engagement with examples of Electronic Dance Music, since the African diaspora 
has played a significant role in the development of EDM genres. Disco emerged in 
the 60s and 70s in New York at predominantly black and Puerto Rican gay clubs as 
a mix of gospel, R&amp;B and funk. Similarly, predominantly black, Puerto-Rican and 
gay communities served as crucibles for early house (Chicago), garage (New York) 
and techno (Detroit). It is with particular interest, then, that I turn to Veit 
Erlmann&rsquo;s contribution to Monson&rsquo;s book on the African diaspora. In an essay 
that lies somewhere between ethnomusicology and popular music studies, Erlmann 
uses the commonly-assumed connection of repetition to black expressive culture 
to bring up the concept of Signifyin(g).<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Using Henry Louis Gates&rsquo;s 
formulation as a starting point,<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> Erlmann defines Signifyin(g) as a 
discursive strategy common in nearly all African-diasporic expressive culture. 
This strategy entails the use, reuse and misuse of pre-existing cultural forms 
and artifacts in contexts that often bring out ironic, unexpected or subversive 
meanings. Erlmann goes on to suggest that, in the context of Signifyin(g), 
repetition foregrounds style and manner over the presentation of novel content. 
Thus, if the communication of content is not a priority, Rebecca Leydon&rsquo;s 
mapping of loss of musical syntax to a loss of the musical subject does not hold 
for musics of the African Diaspora. As Erlmann argues, repetition does not aim 
at a reflection of reality, but a ritualization of reality.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.17] However, Erlmann&rsquo;s interpretation of how repetition functions has not&mdash;to 
my knowledge&mdash;been taken up in the mainstream of popular music 
studies/criticism. Contributions from popular music discourses have generally 
fallen into both positive and negative categories. For the most part, those 
popular music scholars who do directly address repetition either rearticulate 
Adorno&rsquo;s critiques or lionize repetition by characterizing repetitive music as 
essentially transgressive and oppositional. In this latter case, repetitive 
music is radicalized as the mortal enemy of the dominant discourse of Western 
art music, heroically disrupting narrative and denying meaning. In this manner, 
one might map repetition to cultural rebellion and social rupture. However, the 
same could be argued for radically disjunct and abstract non-repetitive music, 
and certainly not all production of repetitive music occurs in oppositional, 
transgressive contexts. A great many things may offend narrowly imagined notions 
of Western art music traditions, and thus repetition gains no special 
distinction in this respect.</p>

<p>[2.18] Richard Middleton, in his essay on repetition and popular music, touches 
upon an important issue for Electronic Dance Music. He considers Kiparski&rsquo;s 
continuum of variability and formula for oral poetry, encompassing three 
categories on this continuum, from &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; to &lsquo;flexible&rsquo; to &lsquo;free&rsquo;, where 
&lsquo;fixed&rsquo; represents the most repetitive and unvaried forms.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Kiparski then 
correlates the two extremes of this continuum to a parallel continuum of 
function from &lsquo;ritual&rsquo; to &lsquo;entertainment.&rsquo; Middleton suggests a corresponding 
musical continuum, with disco at one end and Jimi Hendrix at the other.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> Although he stops just short of raising the issue, he nonetheless provides a 
path to identifying an underlying evaluation of unvaried repetition that reduces 
it to a purely functional and non-aesthetic object. Following from his example, 
disco as the &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; end of the spectrum risks being dismissed as merely 
a soundtrack for an oft-derided and primitivized ritual of sexual sociality. 
This point has also been made with regards to Electronic Dance Music in the work 
of Mark Butler.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.19] Middleton also tries to explain the seemingly common-sense criticisms of 
repetition in popular music, even from within popular music discourses. Phrases 
such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same&rdquo; make sense because of a slippage in evaluative 
logic. There is an implied and/or ideological sense in which &ldquo;a particular 
conventionalized proportion of repetition to non-repetition is naturalized&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> Consequently, popular music is often judged to exceed this proportion and thus 
to be in bad taste.</p>
<p>[2.20] This line of thought brings me to the essay that essentially started this 
whole project: Russel Potter&rsquo;s defense of black cultural forms with regards to 
repetition.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> Entitled &ldquo;Not the Same,&rdquo; Potter clearly resents what he 
considers a racial essentialism connecting black expressive culture to 
repetition. He takes Tricia Rose to task for her monograph, <i>Black Noise,</i><sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> accusing her of just this sort of essentialism, then proceeds to argue that the 
repetition so prominent in black-influenced popular music is not really 
repetition. He bases his defense on the distinction between blank repetition and 
repetition with difference&mdash;that is, Signifyin(g). However, he establishes this 
distinction by shifting Middleton&rsquo;s conventional boundary of acceptable 
repetition to a position that rescues jazz, blues and rap, but at the expense of 
disco, techno and other dance music genres. The problem with Signifyin(g) as a 
defense for repetition is that it relies on the continuing devaluation of its 
own Other: exact duplication or repetition <i>tout court.</i></p>
<p>[2.21] It is these last two issues that not only inform, but also motivate my 
work on repetition. As I had mentioned in my introduction, defenses of 
repetition tend to apologize or sidestep the issue altogether. Those that 
sidestep do so by reducing repetition to pure function, describing how 
repetition functions without addressing meaning or value. Those that apologize 
do so by defending their own localized practice of repetition at the expense of 
repetition as a larger concept&mdash;often identifying another genre as unacceptably 
repetitive in a sort of sacrificial substitution. Also, although the detractors 
of repetition tend to be too cynical and pessimistic, its defenders in cultural 
studies such as Deleuze and Lyotard, often place their discourses at a great 
remove from musical practice.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> In the &ldquo;pan-media&rdquo; approach of cultural 
studies, music tends to get passed over for careful analysis, and thus cultural 
theorists often fail to ground their argumentation in the analysis or close 
reading of cultural (musical) artifacts&mdash;an aporia that I shall begin to fill in 
the second section of this essay.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[3] THEORIZING PLEASURE IN AND OF REPETITION</b></p>

<p>[3.1] The choice of Electronic Dance Music (EDM hereafter) to illustrate the 
process and pleasure of repetition seemed perfectly obvious to me at the 
beginning of the research process. Not only did I see EDM as the most 
unapologetically repetitive of popular music meta-genres, but its electronic 
mediation seemed to fulfill Benjamin&rsquo;s prophecy that, &ldquo;To an ever greater degree 
the work of art reproduced becomes the work of art designed for 
reproducibility&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.2] Nevertheless, there remains some groundwork to take care of before I can 
proceed to issues of pleasure and repetition in EDM. In particular, I need to 
address the ontology of pleasure itself, as well as seek out a theory for the 
engendering and experience of pleasure that is compatible with repetition. To 
this end, I would like to return to Freud&rsquo;s theories of pleasure and repetition 
and also introduce an alternate and dissenting voice. In my view, there are two 
main problems underlying Freud&rsquo;s conception of pleasure (and, consequently, 
repetition compulsion): the <i>a priori </i>pathology of repetition and the failure 
to imagine pleasure arising from something other than satiation. This first 
issue is relatively straightforward; for Freud, repetition was always already 
pathological. Being grounded in a clinical discourse, Freud was interested in 
explaining a phenomenon (repetition compulsion) that he already knew to be 
harmful. Thus his task was not to question its positive or negative effects, but 
to explicate why and how some of his subjects repeated past traumas.</p>

<p>[3.3] As a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; theory of repetition and pleasure, then, Freud&rsquo;s notion of 
repetition compulsion (and its connections to the death instinct) is already a 
non-starter. It remains, however, as a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; or critical interpretation; in 
other words, it does not comprehend repetition and repetitive behaviors in their 
totality, but identifies potential problems. Freud&rsquo;s categories of both pleasure 
and repetition are thus too narrow, which possibly explains why he found that 
the latter was &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; the former. Writing only seven years after Freud&rsquo;s 
<i>Beyond the Pleasure Principle, </i>Karl B&uuml;hler strongly criticized Freud&rsquo;s 
interpretation of pleasure and repetition compulsion, suggesting that Freud&rsquo;s 
connection of repetitive children&rsquo;s games to a death instinct reflected the 
despair of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> In the place of <i>Thanatos</i> and a return 
to primordial stillness, B&uuml;hler proposes a tripartite system of pleasure: 
satiation pleasure (<i>Lust der Befriedigung</i>), function pleasure 
(<i>Funktionslust</i>), and the pleasure of creative mastery (<i>Shaffensfreude, Schaffenslust, Sch&ouml;pferfreude</i>).<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> The first of these terms, satiation 
pleasure, B&uuml;hler considers to be the only form of pleasure that Freud 
recognizes: desire is engendered by drives or the recognition of a lack, 
pleasure is generated by (incompletely) fulfilling it. Given that B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s word 
for satiation (<i>Befriedigung</i>) can mean both &ldquo;fulfillment&rdquo; and &ldquo;pacification,&rdquo; 
one can imagine that Freud&rsquo;s interpretive move to &ldquo;death&rdquo; was not so distant. 
Notably, satiation pleasure places the subject in a receptive, passive position; 
however much one actively seeks it out, fulfillment is always partially 
dependent on circumstance. Also, satiation pleasure is committed to a teleology 
(desire&mdash;&gt;pursuit/anticipation&mdash;&gt;satiation&mdash;&gt;desire?), which makes the 
temporality of pleasure arising from satiation uncertain: how long does pleasure 
last during and after fulfillment? To give a musical example, if one considers 
the audition of an arch-form piece, how long does pleasure last after the 
climactic <i>H&ouml;hepunkt</i>? How long does the memory of climactic fulfillment 
generate pleasure?</p>
<p>[3.4] In contrast to satiation pleasure, function pleasure arises from 
process itself, rather than the process&rsquo;s results. In this case, the subject is 
in an active position, not merely pursuing but generating his/her own pleasure. 
Again in contrast to satiation pleasure, function pleasure is <i>coextensive</i> with the 
activity that generates it, guaranteeing that pleasure continues at least as 
long as one is engaged in the process. A paradigmatic example would be that 
function pleasure arises from baking a cake (provided, of course, that one 
enjoys baking), while satiation pleasure arises from eating it. However, this 
example is somewhat misleading in that it implies that one form of pleasure 
necessarily precedes and results in another one&mdash;function pleasure is simply 
&ldquo;bonus&rdquo; pleasure awarded to one who actively pursues his/her own satiation. My 
understanding of function pleasure, however, extends also to activities that do 
not necessarily produce desire-fulfilling objects, such as dance and musical 
performance,<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> and thus function pleasure arises properly from process. For 
this reason, I would like to replace the term &ldquo;function&rdquo;&mdash;which unhelpfully 
implies teleology and production&mdash;with &ldquo;process pleasure.&rdquo; The distinction 
between production pleasure and B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s third category of pleasure arising from 
&ldquo;creative mastery&rdquo; is less clear, and those who have followed B&uuml;hler 
have generally collapsed this last category into the preceding one: the 
experience of creative mastery is what generates <i>Funktionslust</i>&mdash;the 
pleasure of a job well done.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> However, I would like to retain this division 
and redraw the bounding line between these categories in a new fashion. Changing 
the more cumbersome &ldquo;pleasure of creative mastery&rdquo; to &ldquo;creation pleasure,&rdquo; I 
would see the difference between creation pleasure and process pleasure as a 
matter of productivity: the first arises from the satisfaction of productive 
achievement, while the latter arises from activity itself. If satiation pleasure 
arises from receiving and creation pleasure arises from making, process pleasure 
arises from <i>doing.</i><<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> Also, I would like to borrow the notion of &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; from B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s 
third category to help explain how &ldquo;doing&rdquo; can itself generate pleasure. Much 
like the pleasure of creative mastery arises from a task/product well done, the 
pleasure in process arises from doing <i>well</i>&mdash;mastery over an activity and the 
objects involved in it. Dancing, for example, is an opportunity to take pleasure 
in manifesting capacity, control and proficiency in dance as an activity and 
over the body as its medium.</p>

<p>[3.5] Before tracing my way back to repetition, I should provide some 
clarification and a few caveats. B&uuml;hler and his theoretical inheritors were 
clearly interested in promoting their versions of process pleasure and creation 
pleasure as non-pathological, healthy paths to pleasure. I am not as interested 
in promoting one form of pleasure over the other; I can easily envision 
&ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; instances of each category. Neither do I wish to 
suggest that process is naturally or necessarily pleasurable; as any survivor of 
severe obsessive-compulsive disorder will attest, process is by no means 
pleasurable if one cannot stop. As we will soon see, I also do not view these 
categories of pleasure as operating independently from one another. 
Nevertheless, I will be paying greater attention to process pleasure because it 
is the most difficult to explain, the most difficult to justify and&mdash;as a 
strange form of pleasure that neither consumes (satiation) nor produces 
(creation)&mdash;offers the most potential for novel explications of pleasure.</p>

<p>[3.6] It is also through process pleasure that I see a connection back to 
repetition. As B&uuml;hler argues, in response to Freud, repetition is not beyond the 
pleasure principle, but a prime bearer of process pleasure.<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> As I will argue 
below, repetition functions as a sort of process, structuring activity in a 
manner that optimizes opportunities to exercise mastery of listening/dancing.</p>
<p>[3.7] In addition to issues of pleasure, EDM presents some challenges with 
respect to previous theories of repetition. In particular, Keil&rsquo;s notion of 
&lsquo;participatory discrepancies&rsquo; relies on live, communal performances where an 
individual&rsquo;s contributions can vary from moment to moment and in contrast to 
other individuals. While this ethos of communality and <i>communitas</i> can still be 
imagined through the interplay of dancers and DJ, the degree to which this is 
&lsquo;live&rsquo; in the same manner as Keil&rsquo;s examples makes it difficult to draw close 
parallels. Nonetheless, this particular challenge also makes the case of EDM 
especially appropriate for this paper. Since I intend to avoid defending one 
form of repetition by imagining a more repetitive Other form of repetition, 
EDM&rsquo;s potential to repeat with digital precision will force me to deal with 
repetition in its most problematic form, much in the same way that Linda 
Williams&rsquo; seminal work on pornography passes over the less objectionable &ldquo;soft&rdquo; 
porn and &ldquo;couples films&rdquo; and focuses directly on hard-core and BDSM 
forms of pornography.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.8] Similar motivations also inform my choice of examples from the styles and 
sub-genres within EDM. The three tracks<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> from which the following examples 
will be drawn are not a representative cross-section of EDM, but rather a 
sampling of those sub-genres that make the most explicit and extended use of 
repetition. In particular, these three tracks will represent two sub-genres of 
techno (itself only one genre/category within the realm of EDM): its more 
austere branch of &ldquo;minimal&rdquo; techno, and tech-house, which is a hybrid of house 
and techno styles.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.9] To aid in this consideration of repetition&mdash;particularly that of practice 
rather than ontology&mdash;I would like to make a shift away from the term 
&lsquo;repetition&rsquo;. Following Christopher Hasty&rsquo;s notion of meter as process, Eugene 
Montague has forwarded the concept of repetition as an ongoing and open process, 
which he identifies with the gerundive form, &lsquo;repeating&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> Within the context 
of EDM, I will parallel this formulation by employing the noun &lsquo;loop&rsquo; and the 
gerund &lsquo;looping.&rsquo; These terms come from two complementary sources: Mark Spicer&rsquo;s 
recent article on accumulative form, and Mark Butler&rsquo;s work on rhythm and meter 
in EDM. Spicer defines accumulative form as the &ldquo;technique of building up a 
groove gradually from its constituent parts&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> In turn, he defines &lsquo;groove&rsquo; as &ldquo;a tapestry of riffs&rdquo;, and defines &lsquo;riffs&rsquo; as 
atomic musical ideas that normally repeat. This is the point of contact with my 
notion of loops and looping. Effectively, loops are riffs of modular length that 
one strongly expects to repeat, and looping is the practice of layering, adding 
and subtracting loops, allowing for the seemingly paradoxical effect of an 
ever-changing same.<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.10] This notion gains support from Mark Butler, who defines the loop as the 
fundamental unit of musical structure for EDM.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> Also, he underlines the 
importance of looping by arguing that cyclical repetition, and thus repeated 
listening, allows for the perceptual separation of EDM&rsquo;s complex timbral and 
rhythmic layers.<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> To further this, I would also add that my notion of looping 
in EDM as an ongoing and open process is crucial to an understanding of a 
musical genre that is not normally recorded in a visual form of notation. Thus, 
the structural perception of EDM tracks and sets almost always occurs over time, 
with a fading memory of past events and a growing expectation of future ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>[4] LOOPING AS PROCESS</b></p>

<p>[4.1] I would like to begin with this idea of looping as an open process and 
explore how this is manifested in EDM. This is best approached through Mark 
Spicer&rsquo;s recent work on accumulative form. Spicer begins from Peter J. 
Burkholder&rsquo;s analysis of Charles Ives&rsquo; work, wherein Burkholder defines 
&lsquo;cumulative form&rsquo; as Ives&rsquo; idiosyncratic practice of reversing the order of 
thematic development.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup> Rather 
than present a theme or idea and then proceed to fragment and develop it, a 
&lsquo;cumulative&rsquo; work gradually presents thematic fragments, which then, as Spicer 
puts it, &ldquo;crystallize into a full-fledged presentation of the main theme in a 
climactic pay-off at the end of the piece&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> Spicer modifies this idea in his definition of &lsquo;accumulative form,&rsquo; replacing 
the climactic presentation of <i>the</i> main theme with the climactic 
accumulation of riffs into a texturally thick groove.</p>

<p>[4.2] I believe that Spicer&rsquo;s version of accumulative form (substituting loops 
for riffs in this case) is one of the most widely used prototypical forms in 
EDM, and I did not need to look far to find examples. The first track that we 
will consider is an especially clear but exceedingly extended example, so I can 
offer only fragments from various points in this accumulative process. The 
recording is a track entitled &ldquo;ethnik,&rdquo; taken from the 1994 &lsquo;minimal&rsquo; 
techno album <i>musik</i> by Plastikman, also known as Richie Hawtin.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.3] In the partial transcription that I have provided (<b>Figure 1</b> 
[<a href="figure.01.pdf">PDF</a>]), one can find 
a graphic representation of this accumulative form in the accumulation of layers 
over time; what I could not convey with this transcription is the corresponding 
accumulation of intensity, although I hope it will be clearly audible in the 
audio excerpts provided. The three audio excerpts show the process of 
accumulation at three points: Excerpt A shows the slow fading in of a 
rhythmically flexible flute line over a metrically ambiguous bassline; B is both 
a local accumulative climax and the midpoint in the larger accumulation towards 
C. All three of these excerpts also show differing ways of employing looping to 
articulate a point or period of change, and make use of the common expectation 
in EDM that structural changes occur on multiples of 4&mdash;whether four beats, four 
bars, eight bars or more. Excerpt A (<b>Audio 1A</b>) fades in a 4-bar flute line 
gradually, so that it is not at first clear when the loop started and thus when 
one can expect another change in texture. B (<b>Audio 1B</b>) makes use of a similar 
strategy with a loop of congas, which makes the sudden appearance of the 
three-part drum loop surprising but all the more emphatic as a structural 
downbeat. On the other hand, C (<b>Audio 1C</b>) forecasts its high point of 
accumulation by applying an EQ filter-shift to the drum loop&mdash;marked by a shift 
in shades of gray&mdash;then removing the triangle loop four bars beforehand and the 
drum loop one bar beforehand.</p>

<p>[4.4] In a fashion similar to that of Plastikman/Hawtin, many EDM producers do 
not only employ accumulative form, but also provide a vocabulary of aural 
signposts to signal various stages of arrival or accumulation. The introduction 
of the kick drum, the sudden removal of several layers only to return with more 
force, and the play of metric ambiguity all provide listeners of EDM with aural 
cues. I will defer issues of process pleasure until our final example (see [6]), 
but I would like to take a moment to consider how the experience of 
mastery&mdash;which provides the ground for process pleasure&mdash;works in looping as 
process. These aural cues and signposts optimize EDM for listening mastery; they 
provide opportunities for listeners to insert themselves into the looping 
process and manifest their proficiency with these massive hypermetrical 
structures. Although it is difficult to generalize, listeners can and often do 
take these opportunities to manifest their mastery in physical ways&mdash;whether by 
marking points of accumulation with punctuating gestures (hand claps, shouts, 
&ldquo;drops&rdquo;, spins, etc.) and changes of dancing style, or by finding ways to bodily 
articulate the processes of looping, demonstrating their capacity to grasp and 
&ldquo;ride&rdquo; the loop.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[5] LOOPING AS PROLONGATION OF PLEASURE</b></p>

<p>[5.1] Before continuing to a consideration of looping-as-process as pleasure, I 
would like to explore how pleasure may arise from looping outside the operation 
of pre-determined structure. As I had mentioned earlier, Mark Butler has 
proposed that the precise and extended repetition idiomatic to EDM benefits the 
listener in allowing him or her to perceptually separate textural layers. Butler 
further developed this idea in his paper read at the 2003 annual meeting of the 
Society for Music Theory (Madison, WI), wherein he suggests that the use of 
unresolved grouping dissonances in EDM does not necessarily pose an irresolvable 
perceptual problem for the listener.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup> Instead, he forwards a mode of 
listening whereby a listener can shift focus between dissonant layers, granting 
perceptual primacy to one grouping at one moment, and to another at the next.</p>

<p>[5.2] I think that this begins to explain how the repetition of seemingly short 
musical units can generate pleasure over extended periods. Using my taxonomy of 
pleasures, this aspect of looping provides a sort of creation pleasure grounded 
in the creation of process. A persistently-looping, dense collection of riffs 
provides a dense layering of textures without pre-determining the listener&rsquo;s 
path of focus. In this manner, a listener is able to construct his/her own 
process(es) of attention, creating a unique sonic pathway and manifesting a form 
of mastery over the ordering of these looping elements. This contingent and 
improvised process is then made available to process pleasure. In other words, 
the listener can imagine the structure that provides the process that engenders 
process pleasure. Although Butler&rsquo;s model focuses primarily on grouping 
dissonance, I would also like to extend his model to include the multiplicities 
of timbre, pitch or approximate register and the interplay between interlocking 
riffs. I believe that most EDM tracks offer many perceptual &lsquo;points of 
attention,&rsquo; whether implied in minimalist textures or fully fleshed out in 
thicker ones. Thus, looping allows the listener to plot pathways between these 
points of attention, mapping out a landscape of shifting creation pleasure while 
prolonging the process pleasure of an ever-changing same.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
		<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Audio 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em;"><audio preload="metadata" controls style="width:300px"><source src="garcia_audio2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="garcia_audio2.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script></audio></p></div>

<p>[5.3] To illustrate this idea, we turn to a track by Tony Rohr called &ldquo;Baile 
Conmigo&rdquo; (or &lsquo;dance with me&rsquo;).<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> (<b>Audio 2</b>) This track is texturally quite 
thick for a techno track, and offers a number of points of attention. Among 
these, I would draw attention to the lower frequency range and the manner in 
which the kick drum&rsquo;s pitch is inflected slightly after each attack: is that 
indeed inflection, or the interference of a higher-pitched synth line? Also, in 
the middle and treble range, note the interplay between interlocking patterns of 
similar, but distinct timbres. Finally, I suggest following the trajectory of 
the constant stream of sixteenth-note &lsquo;clicks&rsquo;, the frequency profile of which 
shifts gradually upward and downward over a period of 4 measures of 4 quarter 
notes or every 16 beats.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[6] PROCESS AS PLEASURE</b></p>

<p>[6.1] The idea that process could be pleasurable first came to me while 
listening to Steve Reich&rsquo;s <i>Piano Phase.</i> To me, there is something uniquely 
satisfying in the friction between the two out-of-phase pianists followed by the 
&lsquo;locking&rsquo; effect when their pulse layers align. I then had further direction 
from the work of Mark Butler, who characterizes the artistic production of 
techno as &ldquo;emphasiz[ing] process more than the construction of particular 
musical objects&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup> Most recently, I found in the work of Karl B&uuml;hler a means 
of articulating this pleasure in the concept of process pleasure (and creation 
pleasure) explicated above. This is one path around the problem of 
functionalism&mdash;of the view that process is pleasurable only insofar as it 
produces a desire-fulfilling object (satiation pleasure). Repetitive processes 
such as looping may serve pragmatic, extra-musical functions such as providing a 
reasonably predictable framework for dancing or providing a particular sort of 
feel that brings a crowd of dancers together at a club. However, they may also 
emerge from and relate back to an aesthetic of process, thus generating pleasure 
in addition to channeling the pleasures of dancing and socializing.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
		<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Audio 3</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em;"><audio preload="metadata" controls style="width:300px"><source src="garcia_audio3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="garcia_audio3.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script></audio></p></div>

<p>[6.2] With this concept in our minds, we can now turn to our next and last 
example: a selection from Akufen&rsquo;s 2002 album, <i>My Way.</i><sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> The track, &ldquo;Deck 
the House,&rdquo; (<b>Audio 3</b>) and the entire album exhibit a unique compositional style, 
which requires a moment of explanation. Montr&eacute;al-based Akufen, also known as 
Marc Leclair, gathered his musical materials for this album with a shortwave 
radio and a <i>lot</i> of time. Rather than sample complete hooks of songs or radio 
broadcasters, which would be illegal in almost any country, he uses brief 
slivers of songs, commercials, DJs&rsquo; banter and static&mdash;most often less than a 
second long.<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup> In &ldquo;Deck the House,&rdquo; he weaves these microsamples together into 
a dizzying collage that illustrates my earlier notion of looping as prolongation 
of pleasure by its thick, multilayered texture and metric ambiguity (try 
locating the downbeat as this excerpt progresses). In addition to this, consider 
what I had argued earlier about process, accumulative form and the aural cues 
that help structure hearing and dancing. Imagine what opportunities arise for 
mastery and pleasure as the listener waits for the kick drum that signals the 
first complete &lsquo;arrival&rsquo; or accumulation of the groove. For me, as one listener 
among many, a large part of the pleasure derived from listening to &ldquo;Deck the 
House&rdquo; stems directly from the pleasure of attending to the unfolding of a 
process both anticipated and unpredictable; inasmuch as process provides an 
opportunity for the manifestation of mastery that generates pleasure, 
challenging and surprising processes raise the stakes of mastery and offer 
higher &ldquo;rewards.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> Although Akufen/Leclair&rsquo;s taste for asymmetrical 
sequencing and metric ambiguity mirrors this unpredictability at the level of 
detailed surface, the fundamentally underdetermined nature of this structural 
unfolding permeates all EDM genres. As the process of looping creates this 
feeling of an ever-changing same, the question constantly arises: when will it 
change next, and how will it still remain the same?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>[7] BEYOND ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC</b></p>

<p>[7.1] I imagine the overall shape of this essay to be one of 
diffusion&mdash;&gt;focus&mdash;&gt;expansion. As I introduced the topic of repetition, we found 
the discourse to be not only fraught, but also widely dispersed and 
disarticulated. Indeed, there was and is no singular discourse of repetition, no 
singular forum where all parties meet. Rather, the discourse and criticism on 
repetition is a general and largely synthetic category for what is in fact a 
vast constellation of discursive acts: solitary declarations, debate between 
peers, and responses to imaginary interlocutors&mdash;and, much like a constellation, 
I have endeavored to connect these &ldquo;dots&rdquo; of discourse into a larger picture.</p>

<p>[7.2] Discourse on repetition, both positive and negative, has largely relied on 
some form of a reflection theory, looking for the strengths and weaknesses of 
collective society or the individual psyche in repetitive structures. What I 
have attempted to offer in its place is a model of what repetition <i>does, </i>for 
whom and how. For these purposes I have revisited Karl B&uuml;hler&rsquo;s alternative to 
Freud&rsquo;s repetition compulsion and adjusted them to better engage with the 
experience of EDM: satiation pleasure, process pleasure, creation pleasure; 
getting, doing, making. Although these categories of pleasure remain provisional 
at most and their application to EDM is only exploratory, I hope to have 
provided a preliminary vocabulary of tools for repetition that do not rely so 
much on a metaphysics of ontology and identity.</p>

<p>[7.3] Of course, one does not need a kick drum to generate pleasure from 
process, and I believe that one does not necessarily need to stay within the 
confines of EDM, either. As my reference to Steve Reich&rsquo;s <i>Piano Phase</i> would 
suggest, this approach to repetition and repetitive processes may also help to 
explicate the manifold pleasures of listening to other musical traditions that 
rely heavily on repetition, including minimalist art music, non-electronic dance 
music, non-western classical traditions and a large proportion of folk 
traditions. Indeed, Reich&rsquo;s essay on music as a &ldquo;gradual process&rdquo; articulates 
similar emphases on process, process-oriented listening and control&mdash;but for the 
minimalist art music of the late 60s and early 70s.<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup> Also, I have restricted 
my work here to the pleasures of listening, without much more than cursory 
consideration of dancing. Although this artificial division and disembodiment of 
listening from dancing greatly reduced the size of this essay, further work in 
this direction is sorely needed.</p>
<p>[7.4] Furthermore, what I hope to offer here is not merely a broadly applicable 
model for repetition as an aesthetic practice. I am also striving to offer a 
rehabilitation and reevaluation of repetition that will hopefully rescue it from 
the categories of infantile regression, pathological compulsion, artlessness or 
a disproportionately dystopian/utopian allegory for social relations. If there 
is a beauty in the New, then there is also the question of a beautiful Same and, 
like repetition itself, the answer may be in the process of asking.</p>
