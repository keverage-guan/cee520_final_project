<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Since the advent of the personal computer in the late 1970&rsquo;s and early 80&rsquo;s, music
theory instruction has been at the forefront of technology, using a wide variety of CAI
(computer aided instruction) programs to supplement classroom instruction. Today, CIA is
in a state of transition, with the Internet continuously creating new ways to access and
communicate information in a manner not possible a few years ago. The World Wide Web is
transforming the study of music theory, expanding the source of learning beyond the
traditional classroom. With technological advancements, it is possible to now create a
learning environment that incorporates text, narration, graphics, animation, sound, and
interactivity into a single multimedia experience that engages the user in cognitive
thought processes that exceed the capabilities of written text. </p>

<p>[2] This review will examine the effectiveness of existing beginning music theory Web
sites intended for beginners. The sites were selected from the Beginners Theory resource
page at the Society of Music Theory [<a href="http://societymusictheory.org/smt-list/docs/beginners-theory.html" target="_links">Music
Theory Resource Page</a>]. These sites reflect the Web&rsquo;s instant access to the world, with
their physical locations in Puerto Rico, Nova Scotia, New York, and Illinois. Because this
review is online, there will be links to the various Web sites in order to demonstrate
features that serve to enhance or detract from the learning process. </p>

<p>[3] The most important feature of any curriculum is the content of the material
considered. But the presentation of that content is nearly as important. For an
instructional Web site multimedia and interactivity are crucial features since they can
involve the user as an active participant in the learning process. A hypermedia design
allows a user to follow a non-linear approach adding flexibility to the way that the user
approaches the material. In this regard, the organization of the Web site is key, for the
user must be able to follow a specific order of presentation, or take a nonlinear approach
and inquire about specific topics with ease. A Web site designer must allow the user easy
and immediate access to the main index from any page within the site. If specific set-up
requirements exist for the browser (certain plug-ins, applications), the site must clearly
explain which are needed and how the proper support is acquired. The degree to which the
Web site incorporates these various features can determine the effectiveness of the
learning environment. </p>

<p>[4] A great site to start with is &ldquo;<a href="http://www.musictheory.halifax.ns.ca/" target="_links">Easy Music Theory</a>,&rdquo; music theory lessons online created by Gary
Ewer. Eighteen lessons are available with topics on the grand staff, note names, the piano
keyboard, note durations, measures, intervals, scales, key signatures, time signatures,
triads, Roman numerals, and key identification. A section on musical terms and definitions
supplements the eighteen main topics. Each lesson includes a quiz that may be printed by
the student, allowing him or her first to answer the questions and then to check the
answers by clicking on a quiz-answer link. </p>

<p>[5] Ewer has done an outstanding job of combining text with supporting notation
graphics, and the inclusion of MIDI files helps the user to &ldquo;synthesize&rdquo; the
musical concepts [Example in <a href="http://www.musictheory.halifax.ns.ca/17triads.html" target="_links">Chapter 17, Triads and Roman Numerals</a>]. The explanations are concise
and written at a level that a beginning student can understand. Many of the examples have
a step-by-step process that challenges the user to utilize critical thinking skills [See <a href="http://www.musictheory.halifax.ns.ca/14tsmc.html" target="_links">Chapter 14, Time

Signatures- Measure Completion</a>]. Preceding each lesson Ewer places a list of concepts
from previous lessons necessary for mastering the new lesson. There are frequent
hyperlinks to previous lessons during the new lesson allowing the user easy access to
material for review. </p>

<p>[6] Navigation at this site is well organized and consistent. At the bottom of each
lesson the user has the option of returning to the main index or clicking on a link to
take the quiz for that lesson. At the quiz page, the user is instructed to print the page,
complete the material, and then click on a link for the quiz answers. The user may also
link back to the lesson for a better understanding of the material before attempting the
quiz. At the end of the answer page links to the next lesson or back to the main index are
present. The consistent pattern of navigation allows the user to find the exact location
of any topic. The site even includes a forum where users may post questions and receive
feedback from the author or participants that use this site. </p>

<p>[7] Ken Fansler&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/~kwfansle/onlinemusicpage.htm" target="_links">Online
Music Instruction Page</a>&rdquo; was created in connection with a graduate-level project
in music education, and is a good example of using the Web to supplement a music education
program. It begins with a welcome page, followed by helpful instructions on how to set-up
the browser, a <a href="http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/~kwfansle/project/projecthome.htm" target="_links">main index</a> that allows the user to choose a skill level, and
ultimately proceeds to instruction on selected topics. While this site includes some
helpful information on certain music theory concepts, and the author&rsquo;s use of sound and
graphics supports the material well, there are certain deficiencies in navigation and
content. An exciting feature of hyperlinks is that they do not force the user into a
linear path of instruction. Navigation at this site unfortunately does force the user to
use a linear sequence of subjects. If a user is in the intermediate section and wishes to
review the section &ldquo;Notation&rdquo;, he or she is forced to follow a linear path that
leads through &ldquo;Beamed notes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Articulation (Note Markings),&rdquo;
&ldquo;Endings and Repeats,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ledger Lines.&rdquo; Similarly, the portions of
the quiz addressing ledger lines are problematic, since the user must return to the
section on beamed notes before reaching the section on ledger lines. Such a system is
neither flexible nor intuitive. [Link to &ldquo;<a href="http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/~kwfansle/project/IntermediateInstr.htm" target="_links">Section One: Notation</a>&rdquo;] A similar example arises for the
intermediate topic &ldquo;Listen and Learn,&rdquo; with sections on triads and percussion
instruments. In order to learn about percussion instruments, one must first review the
lesson on triads, even though the two topics are not closely related. There are also
problems with the content, such as incomplete information. The section on dynamics
includes an explanation with sound examples of loud (f) and soft (p). Rather than
completing the lesson by continuing with listings and explanations of the remaining
dynamic marks pp, mp, mf, ff, Fansler diverges into a section on musical instruments.
[Link to <a href="http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/~kwfansle/project/dynamics.htm" target="_links">&ldquo;Listen and Learn&rdquo; - Dynamics</a>] </p>

<p>[8] An exciting feature of using a Web site in a learning environment is the
availability of sound examples that reinforce graphic and textual information. The Online
Music Theory Site augments concepts in musical notation by using digital audio files that
are accessed by clicking on the actual notation [Example of <a href="http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/~kwfansle/project/articulation.htm" target="_links">Audio
File</a>]. Included in the site&rsquo;s &ldquo;Question and Answer&rdquo; section are sounds for
positive and negative feedback, though these can get annoying after hearing the same
sounds with each answer. Feedback sounds are not generally needed, except with very young
users. If feedback is included, there should be four or five different positive and
negative response sounds so that the user does not become bored with the sound. One
technical recommendation is to embed the audio feedback sound into the html document as a
QuickTime movie, thereby avoiding the delay in waiting for the plug-in to turn on for each
response when the answer page is loaded in the browser. </p>

<p>[9] One of the best interactive music theory Web sites is &ldquo;<a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/" target="_links">Java Music
Theory</a>&rdquo;, maintained by Rob Whelan. This is an ideal site for the beginning user
who needs drill and practice opportunities in basic music concepts. There are eight main
categories, with a choice for sound or no sound with each Java applet. Each applet
contains a section that explains how to use the program and provides options for selecting
experience levels. The Java applets available include: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/NoteReading.html" target="_links">Note Reading</a> Staff note reading tests the user by identifying notes on
  the entire grand staff or the treble or bass clef. </p>
  <p>2) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/PianoKeyFinder.html" target="_links">Piano Key Finder</a> While similar to the Note Reading applet, it has the
  added dimension of matching the notes on a piano keyboard with the notes on the grand
  staff. </p>
  <p>3) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/SpeedReading.html" target="_links">Music Speed Reading</a> Challenges the user to identify notes as they move
  across the staff. An user option allows varying the speed with which the notes move across
  the screen. </p>
  <p>4) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/CReading.html" target="_links">C-Clef Note Reading</a> Comparable to the Note Reading applet, but the
  user works within four possible C clefs, instead of the treble and bass clef. </p>
  <p>5) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/KeySigDrill.html" target="_links">Key Signature Drill</a> An interactive technique for drill on key
  signatures, it also has an option for hearing the major or minor tonic chord or the scale.
  The program may also be set up to ask for the relative key.</p>
  <p>6) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/ScaleBuilding.html" target="_links">Scale Building</a> An interactive design that allows the user to create
  major or minor scales. </p>
  <p>7) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/IntervalDrills.html" target="_links">Interval Drills</a> Gives the user a choice of identifying the interval on
  the screen or building new intervals based on the note presented. </p>
  <p>8) <a href="http://academics.hamilton.edu/music/spellman/JavaMusic/ChordDrills.html" target="_links">Chord Drills</a> Similar to the interval drill applet, but the user may
  identify or build triads or 7th chords. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[10] The main focus of each page is the Java applet. The size of the applets are
designed to fit any monitor, with the directions for using the applet available
immediately below the applet. Each page includes a consistent bottom footer that gives the
user complete access to any applet on the Web site. The only problem that I encountered
with this site is that the main page link for the applet Key Signature Drill is not
working, though the footer links on the bottom of each page do connect to the applet. For
a beginning theory user to utilize this site, it needs to be supplemented with a beginning
theory class, textbook, or another basic online theory site, such as &ldquo;Easy Music
Theory.&rdquo; Once a basic understanding of music theory concepts has been acquired, this
site could provide invaluable in reinforcing an understanding of this material. </p>

<p>[11] Music instruction and interactive Java applets are also included in another
top-rated site, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.teoria.com/" target="_links">Practical Music
Theory</a>,&rdquo; a bilingual Web site created by Jos&eacute; Rodr&iacute;guez Alvira and dedicated to
the study of music theory. In addition to Java applets on identification and construction
exercises for intervals, chords, and scales, there is an online music theory book called <a href="http://www.teoria.com/ba/index.htm" target="_links">Teor&iacute;a&rsquo;s Books</a>, that
includes instruction on intervals, chords, and scales. The combination of instruction and
interactive learning makes this site a comprehensive source for the beginning theory user,
yet there is sufficiently challenging material to make it equally valuable to the
intermediate or advanced user. Each applet includes instructions on how to use the applet
and allows users to select options based on their ability level. </p>

<p>[12] The<a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/ICTest.htm" target="_links">
interval-construction</a> applet allows the user to assemble intervals, while the <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/IITest.htm" target="_links">interval-identification</a>
applet displays an interval and asks the user to identify the distance. The <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/CCTool.htm" target="_links">chord-construction-tool</a>
applet allows the user to see any type of chord, as well as the inversions of the chord.
Not only does the applet display major, minor, diminished, and augmented triads, the user
may select 7th, 9th, and augmented-6th chords. The <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/CCTest.htm" target="_links">chord-construction-exercise</a>
applet challenges the user to take the next step by having him or her build new chords
that include all of the variations from the chord-construction-tool applet. The <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/CITest.htm" target="_links">chord-identification-exercise
</a>applet has the user identify the listed chord and provides options for levels of
difficulty and choices from major and minor triads, 7th, 9th, and augmented-6th chords.
The <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/SCTool.htm" target="_links">scale-construction-tool</a>
applet displays any imaginable type of scale; besides major and minor scales, the user may
view various modes and scales. Finally, the <a href="http://www.teoria.com/java/eng/SITest.htm" target="_links">scale-identification</a>
applet presents various scales for recognition. This Web site contains a wealth of
information on the elements of music theory and challenges the user to expand his or her
knowledge of the elements of music through interactive exercises. This site is unique in
that all of the information is available in English and Spanish. </p>

<p>[13] The purpose of this review has been to promote the unlimited potential for music
theory instruction available through the World Wide Web. Multimedia tools continue to
improve and it is important for music sites to remain current with the latest technology.
Digital sound files incorporate large amounts of memory and take time to load across the
Internet. Alternative technologies include MIDI files or Real Audio files that greatly
reduce the size of the file while still preserving the integrity of the sound. The
addition of Java applets adds interactive features to a Web site, drawing the student into
an engaging learning experience. As a supplement to a music theory class, an online music
class, or a learning site available to individuals with an interest in music theory, the
Internet is evolving into a new and dynamic place to learn about the elements of music. </p>
