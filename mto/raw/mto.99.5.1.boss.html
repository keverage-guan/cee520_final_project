<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Among followers of Schenker, the notion of &ldquo;hidden repetition&rdquo; has
garnered a good deal of interest in recent years. Articles by Beach, Burkhart, Cadwallader
and Pastille, Kamien, Rothgeb, and Schachter, among others, have illustrated how
repetition of a given motive or motives at different levels contributes to organic
coherence in a variety of tonal works.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> However, one rarely finds in this literature a comprehensive treatment of how the
repetitions of a motive (hidden or otherwise) in a piece bind together into one
all-encompassing process. Many tonal pieces can be heard as working out just such
processes: one not only exists in the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s Sonata Op. 10, No. 1,
but also accounts to a large degree for that piece&rsquo;s motivic coherence. </p>

<p>[2] There is another analytic tradition originating in the same time and place as
Schenker&rsquo;s that concerns itself specifically with the question of how a single process can
organize motivic relations (or other kinds of relations) across the surface of a tonal
piece. That tradition stems from the theoretical work of Arnold Schoenberg. Schoenberg&rsquo;s
analytic approach has not been adopted as commonly in studies of tonal music as has
Schenkerian analysis: one possible reason is a disagreement among scholars who use
Schoenberg&rsquo;s method about its basic terms and concepts, such as &ldquo;developing
variation,&rdquo; <i>Grundgestalt</i>, and &ldquo;musical idea.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Accordingly, I begin by briefly
outlining my understanding of the Schoenbergian terms crucial to my study. Schoenberg
accounts for coherence in a piece by showing how its initial material (what he calls <i>Grundgestalt</i>)
sets up an opposition of pitches, chords, motives, or rhythms that is then elaborated
through the course of the piece and ultimately resolved (by the principal ingredient of
the <i>Grundgestalt</i> absorbing or subsuming its opponent) at or near the end. This
blueprint for a whole piece, which can also be thought of as a compositional dialectic, is
what Schoenberg means by the term &ldquo;musical idea&rdquo; or <i>musikalische Gedanke</i>.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> My article will show how the motives
at foreground and low-middleground levels in the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s Op. 10, No.
1 project a process very much like that described by Schoenberg, but unlike Schoenberg and
other scholars who practice Schoenbergian analysis, I will limit what I call
&ldquo;motive&rdquo; to segments that are equivalent to diminutions in the Schenkerian sense
or that combine such diminutions. This is how I plan to forestall the kinds of criticism
that have been made against Schoenbergian analysis by Schenkerians such as Rothgeb and
Burkhart; namely, that the motivic segments in Schoenberg&rsquo;s analyses and those of his
followers disagree with the segmentation that would be imposed by a correct Schenkerian
graph.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Since my approach relies on
Schenker for motive identification but interprets the relations between some of these
motives in a way parallel to Schoenberg&rsquo;s musical idea, I have given it the label
&ldquo;Schenkerian-Schoenbergian Analysis.&rdquo; </p>

<p>[3] I believe &ldquo;Schenkerian-Schoenbergian Analysis&rdquo; introduces a new way of
amalgamating the two approaches. Others have attempted to combine them, most notably David
Epstein in <i>Beyond Orpheus</i>, but in ways considerably different from the present
article.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Epstein&rsquo;s concept of
&ldquo;musical idea&rdquo; focuses primarily on the power of the <i>Grundgestalt</i> to
unify the piece through its repetition at various structural levels, not on the
dialectical process that organizes such repetitions through the piece.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> His focus results in some insightful
analyses, which sometimes describe the introduction of elements foreign to the main
tonality within the <i>Grundgestalt</i> and the elaborations through the piece of such
oppositions (his account of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> motive that appears in measures 4&ndash;5 of the first
movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Eroica</i> Symphony and its subsequent consequences is a good
example; see pages 111&ndash;27). Yet rarely does he show how such foreign elements are
assimilated into the home tonality as the final stage of an overarching process. In
addition, the middleground shapes Epstein claims as offspring of the motive sometimes
diverge from what would typically be considered Schenkerian middlegrounds (again, an
example can be found in his <i>Eroica</i> analysis: a reordering of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> motive
that goes D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, see page 114). In the present article, middleground motives always
function as diminutions in an orthodox sense. </p>

<p>[4] Another, more recent, contribution that combines aspects of Schoenberg&rsquo;s
theoretical writings with the Schenkerian approach is Janet Schmalfeldt&rsquo;s <i>Music
Analysis</i> article on the &ldquo;Reconciliation of Schenkerian Concepts with Traditional
and Recent Theories of Form.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Schmalfeldt focuses on a different aspect of Schoenberg&rsquo;s theoretical output from my
article: she demonstrates rather convincingly the mutual influences between formal
elements introduced or developed by Schoenberg in <i>Fundamentals of Musical Composition</i>
and various harmonic-contrapuntal structures characteristic of the Schenkerian viewpoint.
Much of her article deals with Schenkerian correlates to the parts of the
&ldquo;sentence&rdquo; structure proposed by Schoenberg in <i>Fundamentals</i>, but in
addition she illustrates how Schoenberg&rsquo;s distinction between &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; themes and
&ldquo;loosely-constructed&rdquo; themes and transition sections is enriched by and
contributes to the Schenkerian perspective. One of the main pieces she analyzes is the
same Beethoven sonata movement I take up in my article; accordingly, I will comment on
differences between Schmalfeldt&rsquo;s and my analyses of specific passages in the footnotes. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Beethoven, Sonata Op. 10, no. 1, i, mm. 1&ndash;10, beginning of exposition&rsquo;s first theme</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="boss_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="boss_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[5] In Beethoven&rsquo;s Op. 10, No. 1, first movement, the <i>Grundgestalt</i> is measures 1&ndash;9,
the initial period plus the downbeat of the following measure. See <b>Example 1</b>. This opening unit contains two voice-leading strands
within the i - vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> - <nobr>i<sup>6</sup></nobr> progression that can be heard as opponents to one another. The
reasons are: 1) they present diminutions of different kinds, and 2) they are given
contrasting characters through the surface characteristics applied to them such as
register, dynamics, and diminution. These motives are the ascending third harmonized by
parallel tenths (labeled delta in Example 1)
and the double neighbor figure (labeled alpha).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Within the <i>Grundgestalt</i>, motive delta is undoubtedly more
strongly presented. Delta&rsquo;s first two notes (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and F) are not only led up to by long
arpeggios at a <i>forte</i> dynamic, but also are set in a high register, repeated and
accented. The third note of delta, G (which is the movement&rsquo;s primary tone), gets less
registral, diminutional, and dynamic emphasis, yet it has a relatively long note value and
occurs on a downbeat. It, too, has an arpeggio prefix, consisting of two grace notes.
Meanwhile, the parallel tenths supporting delta possess the registral low end of the
passage, and are also dynamically emphasized. In contrast, motive alpha occurs in a middle
register at a <i>piano</i> dynamic and has no surface diminutions prefixed to its members,
giving it an unmistakable inner-voice quality.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>. Beethoven, Sonata Op. 10, no. 1, i, mm. 56&ndash;71, beginning of exposition&rsquo;s second theme</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="boss_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="boss_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[6] According to Schoenberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;idea,&rdquo; the next step in Beethoven&rsquo;s process,
having established an opposition between motives delta and alpha, would be to elaborate
that opposition. Analyses by Schoenberg, Patricia Carpenter, and Severine Neff (as well as
others) illustrate a variety of ways that tonal pieces elaborate such oppositions; often,
one of the opposing elements is a foreign pitch or chord with respect to the home key and
the other is the tonic triad, and the elaboration consists of allowing the foreign element
to simulate a tonic. In the movement under consideration, however, the procedure is a bit
different, since the opposing elements are two motives, both members of the
tonal-prolongational structure of measures 1&ndash;9, which are marked as divergent by surface
characteristics such as register and dynamics rather than by the tonalities they
represent. In a few words, Beethoven gradually increases motive alpha&rsquo;s salience by giving
it delta&rsquo;s original surface characteristics, while at the same time submerging motive
delta by replacing its dominant characteristics with more recessive ones. This process
then culminates in delta becoming a diminution of alpha, which, it seems to me, makes the
motivic process resemble Hegelian dialectic. The exchange of status between the two
motives begins at the exposition&rsquo;s second theme, directly following a transition based
almost entirely on the inversion of motive delta. See <b>Example 2</b>.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> The first presentations of alpha in measures 56&ndash;70 are somewhat veiled: they occur in the
middleground behind the bass part, and are inversions of the original alpha. The soprano
during these same measures does not present alpha as such; but instead begins with the
middleground succession <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>4</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>. This succession not only balances upper and lower
neighbors like alpha and hence can be heard as related to it, but it also creates a rather
normative example of the style structure Robert Gjerdingen identifies as a hallmark of the
Classical era; combined as it is with alpha in the bass and I - <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> - <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> - I in the
harmony, and placing as it does suspensions leading to <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> and <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> on downbeats 4 measures
apart.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> The soprano follows
this at measures 64&ndash;71 with an ornamented version of a similar succession, <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>, which
in its contrapuntal, harmonic and metrical contexts also strongly resembles Gjerdingen&rsquo;s
style structure. The passage we have just discussed and the corresponding one in the
recapitulation (measures 215&ndash;48) are the only places in the movement where alpha plays a part
in such structures; so that it is not necessary here to shift our focus to them from the
process we are beginning to describe involving the gradual transformation of alpha within
this movement. (Had we been considering relationships between Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata movement
and those of his Classical precursors&mdash;as Gjerdingen does&mdash;we might, however.) We can
think of such style structures as early stages that alpha passes through on its journey
toward greater salience: stable passages within which alpha (as bass line rather than
inner voice) plays an increasingly significant role. </p>

<p>[7] The principal way that Beethoven increases motive alpha&rsquo;s salience in this movement is to bring it from the middleground closer to the surface (and then he gives it delta&rsquo;s surface characteristics, as I suggested above). Authors on hidden repetition generally refer to this technique as &ldquo;contraction&rdquo;; see for example the Rothgeb and Burkhart articles mentioned in footnote 1. There are three contractions of alpha in the second theme&rsquo;s closing measures&mdash;one at measures 82&ndash;84 (which is repeated at measures 84&ndash;86) and the others at measures 86&ndash;90, in the alto and bass. See <b>Example 3</b>. Beethoven highlights the first contraction of alpha as a segment by repeating it, while the second and third at measures 86&ndash;90 are set off by registral and textural changes, as
well as by the reintroduction of the ascending arpeggio prefix characteristic of delta
when it first appeared in measures 1&ndash;9. These three double neighbors are not literally on the
surface of the music, but are certainly closer than their counterparts in measures 56&ndash;70
(actually, not being on the surface helps us hear them as increasingly salient, given the
fast tempos at which the passage is normally played). The last two alphas at measures 86&ndash;90
incorporate a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> passing tone between the upper neighbor C and the lower neighbor
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>&mdash;creating ascending and descending spans of a third within the vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><sup>7</sup></nobr>/V chord.
This is a significant move, because the ascending and descending thirds, delta and its
inversion, now serve as diminutions of the double neighbors, alpha and its inversion;
prefiguring Beethoven&rsquo;s ultimate synthesis later in the piece, where the ascending third
ornamenting the double neighbor moves up out of the inner voice into the soprano.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[8] The codetta in the exposition summarizes the direction of the foregoing measures
and at the same time brings alpha forward all the way to the surface of the music. See <b>Example 4</b>. The tonic pitches in the descending <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> arpeggio from measure 98 to measure 105 are all decorated by lower and upper neighbors; the former
harmonized, the latter dissonant. The dominant pitches receive a single upper neighbor. </p>

<p>[9] The development section begins with a presentation of motive delta, the ascending
third, in C major, which retains many of the surface features that accompanied delta in
the first theme: the ascending arpeggios leading up to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> and F, the alternation
between <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i> dynamics, the accents on repeated <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>s and Fs.
See <b>Example 5</b>. But two essential features of
the original ascending third are now missing; and because of this, it makes more sense to
hear high <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>, F and G as surface diminutions rather than the low-middleground
motive that delta had originally been. First, motive delta no longer prolongs a tonic
triad&mdash;while the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> is harmonized by I and the F by vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, just as before, the G
is now supported by a vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> of iv, leading into the next section of the development
which tonicizes F minor. Second, the harmonization in parallel tenths that delta had
originally had has disappeared: instead, we hear <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>-F-G in the lowest voice, which
would cause middleground parallel octaves with a manifestation of delta in the highest
register. Possibly we could hear this low-register ascending third as delta without the
accompanying tenths, but in that case the members of delta would all lack the surface
characteristics such as diminution, accent, and dynamics that marked them as dominant in
measures 1&ndash;9. All these factors work together to make the ascending third less salient.
Meanwhile, motive alpha also bridges I to vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> of IV, but as a diminution circling
around a single note&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> this time rather than C&mdash;it seems better able to retain
its aural identity while reinforcing the ultimate direction of the passage (toward the
subdominant). </p>


<p>[10] The trend of bringing motive alpha forward to the surface and thus increasing its
salience, which we heard in the exposition, continues in the development. See <b>Example 6</b>. At measures 119&ndash;21, we hear the double
neighbor at the surface in the soprano: this is the original form, with lower neighbor
first. It appears again a perfect fourth higher at measures 127&ndash;29, as part of a sequence
tonicizing first iv, then iv of iv. At the same time, the inversion of alpha underlies the
tonicizations of F minor and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> minor, in a manner very similar to the second theme. All
the notes of alpha get a consonant skip of a third, as they had in the earlier passage,
and the harmony, I - <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> - <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> - <nobr>V<sup>7</sup></nobr> - I, only slightly varies that of the earlier
passage (though the addition of <nobr>V<sup>7</sup></nobr> turns alpha into a motive projected by a combination of
two voices; the third note of alpha&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> in measure 121 and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> in measure 129&mdash;is,
according to my reading, a tenor note). In measures 118&ndash;33, then, the alpha motive appears
simultaneously at two levels&mdash;foreground and low middleground&mdash;saturating the pitch
structure in a way we have not heard to this point. In the measures almost immediately
following, the double neighbor begins to saturate the piece in another way. See <b>Example 7</b>, my graph of measures 136&ndash;41 and their
immediate context. Here, every two-measure unit contains alpha, presented in sixths and
tenths without accompaniment to call the listener&rsquo;s attention to it. These measures are a
culmination of the double neighbor&rsquo;s gradual growth in salience&mdash;at this point in the
movement, nothing is happening <i>except</i> alpha. The graph makes clear the function of
these motivic repetitions in their larger context: they embellish a prolonged neighbor <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> which resolves back to the primary tone at measure 148. One interesting aside about Beethoven&rsquo;s
approach to the primary tone: note that the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> neighbor that supplants <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in measures 143&ndash;45,
the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, and the eventual resolution G are counterpointed by lower neighbors in the bass,
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>-F and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>-C. The notion of balancing upper and lower neighbors affects
this piece in ways beyond the process involving the alpha motive. We&rsquo;ll see another,
higher-level, example later on. </p>

<p>[11] As one would expect, the recapitulation replays the motivic process we heard in
the exposition, with few changes (although one of those changes is extremely significant
to the motivic process as a whole). Motive delta reasserts itself at measures 168&ndash;76,
&ldquo;pushing alpha back down into the inner voice,&rdquo; as it were. And although the
recap&rsquo;s transition points toward F major rather than <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> as it originally had, it still
relies heavily on inversions of delta. Motive alpha does not begin to regain the upper
hand until the second theme at measure 215. See my graph of measures 215&ndash;47 in <b>Example 8</b>. Since Beethoven states the first two phrases of his theme
in F major, then repeats them in C minor, we have <i>two</i> opportunities to hear the
repeated inversion of alpha in the bass, counterpointed against <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>4</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> and <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in the soprano. Not only has the composer &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; the key of his
second theme, but he has given himself an opportunity to powerfully reassert the alpha
motive through repetition. </p>

<p>[12] In measures 251&ndash;53, the movement&rsquo;s fundamental line makes its descent to <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>, and this
is followed almost immediately (at measures 259&ndash;67) by the statements of motive alpha that we
heard first in the latter measures of the exposition&rsquo;s second theme. See <b>Example 9</b>. In the recap, the double neighbors
ornament the fifth scale degree, G, setting the listener up for the movement&rsquo;s final
cadence. The first two of these at measures 259 and 261 are not that different from their
counterparts in measures 82 and 84. (One might comment on the way the upper neighbor is delayed
in the second alpha through consonant skip diminutions.) But the third and fourth
manifestations of motive alpha at measures 263&ndash;67 add something significant to their
counterparts at measures 86&ndash;90: the double neighbor that mirrors that of the bass has been
moved up from the alto into the soprano. As the alto had earlier, the soprano here
projects a transposition of the original alpha motive (that is, with lower neighbor
first). Like its alto predecessor, this soprano occurrence of alpha includes an <i>ascending
third</i> as a diminution between the lower and upper neighbors, and the ascending third,
like the original delta of measures 1&ndash;9, is ornamented by arpeggios. This subsumption of delta
and its diminutions by alpha, as I suggested before, constitutes the motivic synthesis
that completes the movement&rsquo;s overarching dialectic. While this synthesis had been buried
in an inner voice at measures 86&ndash;90 (like the alpha motive itself at measures 1&ndash;9), here it bursts
into prominence, capturing both of the outer voices that had belonged to delta at the
beginning of the movement. </p>

<p>[13] Thus the surface, foreground, and low middleground manifestations of motives alpha
and delta project a process akin to Schoenberg&rsquo;s musical idea, which gives a kind of
motivic coherence to Beethoven&rsquo;s work that goes beyond simple unity. One question remains
to be answered, however, concerning my account of this motivic process, a question that
may have caused some skepticism on the part of the reader. Namely, to what extent can we
think of entities such as alpha and delta as <i>motives</i>, since many tonal pieces
depend on and often feature double neighbors and ascending thirds harmonized in parallel
tenths? Shouldn&rsquo;t these rather be thought of as common voice-leading components of the
tonal system? David Epstein in <i>Beyond Orpheus</i> suggests one answer to this question;

I will consider his and then contrast it with my own. According to Epstein, a common tonal
element such as a major triad can be heard as a motive if it displays some &ldquo;unusual
property or characteristic&rdquo; that it shares with other manifestations of that motive
in the piece. For example, his attribution of motive status to the two <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> chords that open
the first movement of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Eroica</i> Symphony hinges on the fact that their
(rather unusual) spacing replicates almost exactly the pitch-class sequence of the
beginning of the first theme.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[14] In the opening movement of the Op. 10, No. 1 sonata, however, it is difficult to
find unusual characteristics of (for instance) the alpha motive in measures 1&ndash;9 that it shares
with the other manifestations of alpha in the piece. Indeed, alpha&rsquo;s gradually taking on
new characteristics as the movement progresses is a crucial reason for my hearing the
piece as the elaboration of an opposition between alpha and delta. It seems that here the
motives should be justified as such on different grounds. Possibly the fact that they take
part in a process that spans the entire piece is enough; in other words, it is the motivic
progression <i>itself</i> that invests alpha and delta with motivic significance. My
viewpoint here does not go too far beyond Schoenberg&rsquo;s when he asserts in <i>Fundamentals
of Musical Composition</i> that &ldquo;every element or feature of a motive must be
considered to be a motive if it is treated as such, that is if it is repeated with or
without variation.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The
main difference is I am claiming that it is not mere directionless repetition or
variation, but an <i>organized process</i> of repetition and variation that causes me to
single alpha and delta out from among all the other components of voice-leading in the
piece. Many tonal pieces do indeed repeat and vary double neighbors and third-spans
harmonized in tenths, but how many set two such components against one another in an
opposition based on surface characteristics at the beginning, allow one to gradually wrest
the position of dominance (or salience) from the other as the piece progresses, then
culminate the process at the end by making the component that had been more salient at the
beginning serve as the diminution of the other? </p>

<p>[15] One other voice-leading component that Beethoven identifies as a motive through
the process in which it plays a part is what I will call motive beta. Motive beta gives
rise to a non-dialectical process that also helps to structure the work, and in addition
beta combines with delta and alpha in ways significant to the shaping of the piece. Motive
beta is the stepwise descent through a perfect or diminished fifth. Its most common
version, G-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-C, makes its initial appearance at the end of the <i>Grundgestalt</i>
(measures 9&ndash;10) at the surface. See <b>Example 10</b>.
Motive beta is repeated immediately at the surface, then repeats with identical pitch
classes at the middleground in measures 16&ndash;22. An incomplete beta, G-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D, also provides a
middleground framework for the closing measures of the development, measures 148&ndash;58. Finally,
motive beta at the same pitch classes, G-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-C, provides the <i>Urlinie</i> for the
entire movement. As we progress through the movement, then, we realize that beta is
undergoing a progressive expansion&mdash;it contributes to the pitch structure on progressively
higher levels. At the same time, all this expansion is balanced by beta&rsquo;s occurrence
(again as G-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-C) on the surface at the end of the piece. My <b>Example 11</b> illustrates this. These surface reminders of beta at
piece&rsquo;s end hook up with motive alpha in an interesting way&mdash;notice that the C that ends
beta at measure 273 reappears as the goal note of alpha two measures later. In this way, beta
seems to lead into alpha. But at the beginning of the piece, delta had led into beta in a
similar way&mdash;see Example 1 again&mdash;the last note
of delta becomes the first note of beta. We could characterize the interaction between the
three motives at beginning and end of piece as delta &ldquo;handing off&rdquo; to beta,
which in turn &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; to alpha. Here also, we have a motivic process that
shows alpha supplanting delta. </p>

<p>[16] Another aspect of the piece&rsquo;s motivic structure that my account of the dialectic
involving delta and alpha ignored is the occurrences of these two motives at levels higher
than the low middleground. There are a number of them, but we will focus on only one,
portrayed in <b>Example 12</b>. This example
verticalizes the unfoldings from the second theme in the exposition and changes some
registers to clearly illustrate the underlying voice-leading. As it turns out, the
unfoldings in measures 56&ndash;70 project an upper neighbor G-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-G followed by a lower neighbor
G-F-G&mdash;a close relative of the inverted alpha motive on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> that structures the bass line
in that same passage. </p>

<p>[17] We have seen that a segmentation of Beethoven&rsquo;s Op. 10, No. 1 according to
Schenkerian principles reveals a succession of motives that closely resembles the
compositional dialectic of Schoenberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;musical idea.&rdquo; I believe that this
approach constitutes a new way of combining Schenkerian and Schoenbergian analysis, one
that could have value for the analysis of works other than Beethoven&rsquo;s. Recently I have
tried a similar &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; approach for the analysis of the first movement of
Mahler&rsquo;s Tenth Symphony and for some of Schoenberg&rsquo;s Op. 6 songs. With both composers,
&ldquo;Schenkerian-Schoenbergian Analysis&rdquo; led to some significant insights about how
the music makes sense as a process in time. What is most interesting is that Schoenberg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; is able to form a framework for pitch structures in Beethoven and Mahler
as well as Schoenberg&rsquo;s own music&mdash;possibly this <i>musikalische Gedanke</i> could be one
among several keys to understanding the development of music in German-speaking countries
in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>

Macmillan, 1954), pages 38&ndash;45. Rufer highlights the repetitions and variations of motives in
the movement&rsquo;s initial phrase, showing how such techniques unify the movement (and mark
Beethoven as a precursor to Schoenberg the twelve-tone composer), but gives no suggestion
that a process involving problem, elaboration and resolution organizes the motivic

on Schenker&rsquo;s analysis in &ldquo;Further Consideration of the Urlinie: I,&rdquo; trans. John
Rothgeb, in <i>The Masterwork in Music</i>, vol. 1, ed. William Drabkin (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1994), pages 105&ndash;06. Schenker&rsquo;s graphs at levels d) and c) in
this analysis not only clearly portray what I am calling motive delta as an ascending
third harmonized in tenths and my alpha as a neighbor C5-B4-C5 that is then turned into a
double neighbor through the addition of the diminution D5, but they also give alpha a
smaller notehead size, marking it as an inner voice in this initial presentation. Schenker
in the commentary writes about a &ldquo;dispute&rdquo; between alpha and delta,
characterizing them as &lsquo;competitors&rsquo; for status as principal line and asserting that delta
deserves preeminence as initial ascent to the primary tone. </p>

<p>The characterization of the two motives in this <i>Grundgestalt</i> as opponents
actually did not originate with Schenker. He may have been aware that Anton Schindler,
Beethoven&rsquo;s contemporary and associate, described this same passage as a manifestation of
the concept of <i>Zwei Principe</i>, which in Beethoven&rsquo;s thinking (according to
Schindler) involved the opposition of &lsquo;strong&rsquo; and &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; musical characters. See Nancy
Hager, &ldquo;The First Movements of Mozart&rsquo;s Sonata, K. 457 and Beethoven&rsquo;s Opus 10, No.
1: a C Minor Connection?,&rdquo; <i>The Music Review</i> 47/2 (1986&ndash;87): 95&ndash;96. </p>

<p>Janet Schmalfeldt in the above-mentioned <i>Music Analysis</i> article (page 256, first
half of <a href='boss8.gif' target='ex_window'>Example 8</a>) also presents a graph of measures
1&ndash;9, which differs only in one essential aspect from my reading: she does not interpret
the D5 in measure 8 as part of a double neighbor figure, but as a chord tone harmonizing the
middle member of the lower neighbor C-B-C. My reasons for highlighting the D5 as part of
motive alpha will become obvious; but her reading has the advantage of more faithfully
following Schenker.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> The transition is not shown in <a href='boss2.gif' target='ex_window'>Example 2</a> to save space in the graphical file; the reader will want
to refer to the full score for measures 32&ndash;56. Descending groups of three parallel 10ths can be
heard at measures 34&ndash;36 and measures 38&ndash;40; while measures 42&ndash;46 adds tenths before and after to extend
the motive to five parallel tenths, and the dominant pedal following measure 48 repeats the
descending form of delta twice at measures 49&ndash;52 and 53&ndash;56, in soprano and tenor voices. </p>

<p>Schmalfeldt also provides a graph of the second theme in her Ex. 14 (pages 272&ndash;73). The
reader can compare her analysis with both of my <a href='boss2.gif' target='ex_window'>Examples
2</a> and <a href='boss3.gif' target='ex_window'>3</a> (Ex. 3 will be discussed in the
following paragraph). Again, the general perspective&mdash;second theme as a prolongation of <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>
over III, a focus on neighbor motion in measures 56&ndash;71 and a middleground descent in measures
90&ndash;94&mdash;seems to be the same. But we differ on some of the details, especially our readings
of measures 82&ndash;86. Schmalfeldt hears this passage as a prolongation of <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>6</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> over IV (the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is
introduced back in measure 80), enabling her to characterize it as part of a culminating
development of the G-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-G motive that has been prominent throughout the second theme
(seeher commentary on pages 275&ndash;76). My reading takes the &ldquo;more conventional&rdquo; tack
of hearing 82&ndash;86 as prolongation of the cadential six-four chord, which enables me to set Bb as
a consonant starting and ending point for repeated statements of motive alpha.<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> Robert O. Gjerdingen, <i>A Classic Turn of Phrase</i>
(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988), especially chapters 4 and 5.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> My interpretation of measures 86&ndash;90 as two alpha motives hinges on
reading the six-four chord in measure 88 as a passing chord within a prolongation of the same chord
from measure 86 to measure 90. This sort of interpretation has precedents in the Schenkerian
literature&mdash;for example, Schenker&rsquo;s own reading of measures 21&ndash;28 of J. S. Bach&rsquo;s C-Minor
Prelude from Book I of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Schenker maintains that a cadential six-four chord in measures 21&ndash;27 resolves to <nobr>V<img border="0" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> at measure 28. The prolongation of the six-four chord is accomplished
mainly through a neighbor vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><sup>7</sup></nobr>/V. In turn, chromatically-altered chord skips from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> to
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and back to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> within this vii<sup>o</sup><nobr><sup>7</sup></nobr>/V are filled in by passing Gs, creating passing six-four chords that are ultimately part of the prolongation of the same chord.
