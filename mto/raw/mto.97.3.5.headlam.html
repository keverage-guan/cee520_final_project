<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section1"><b>1. Introduction</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[1.1] With the advent of powerful, widely accessible, and
financially viable personal computers with network connections on
the World Wide Web, musicians of widely varying interests are
presented with an intriguing prospect:  the possibility of
creating musically meaningful presentations for teaching,
performing, and researching music and disseminating them easily
to colleagues, classes, or even to a potentially vast mass
audience.  These presentations can combine sound, images,
animation, and interaction for stimulating and interesting
results.  The frustrating downside to this picture is, of course,
the necessity of learning different programming languages,
understanding Web page design and networking, dealing with
multiple platforms (principally MacIntosh and Windows), and,
worst of all, solving the problems of generating sound on
different computers.</p>

<p>[1.2] Fortunately, a solution to these obstacles exists in the
multimedia authoring program Director and its Web counterpart
Shockwave, from Macromedia.  This program, currently at version
6.0, is available in an educational form for around $300 and is
well worth the time and effort to learn.  In this paper, I will
outline the format of Director in its Web version with an
emphasis on its potential for sound, and include some
demonstration files.  I have used Director only on the Macintosh,
and this article is written from that perspective, but the
program exists in almost the same form in Windows versions, with
differences noted clearly in the documentation.  The Web
compiler, Shockwave, allows authors to compile Director files for
use on the Web, and a Shockwave plug-in for Web browsers allows
users to access the Director program in a suitable format.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>  I
have used Shockwave only with the browser Netscape Navigator, but
other browsers also support Shockwave.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section2"><b>2. Educational and Research Writings on Music Using Computers</b></a></p> 
 
<p>[2.1] The computer digital revolution is often compared to the
development of the printing press in the 1500s.  The printing
press allowed for wide dissemination of reading material as well
as musical scores.  While books were illustrated, combining the
visual with the printed word, for musicians books and scores
separated the visual from the aural.  An educational industry has
grown up around attempts to recombine these two aspects, usually
with value placed on the ability to conjure sound from image
using internal musical production and by developing musical
memory.  The computer, however, allows authors to combine sound,
text, and images, thus creating a true musical book.
</p>

<p>[2.2] Those who believe in the split between the visual and aural
might be skeptical of the computer&rsquo;s sound production
capabilities, regarding them as a crutch similar to using a piano
for sight-singing or part-writing.  Those who regard it as a
benefit when the visual and aural are joined in a musical
environment will find truly new uses for computers in musical
production, education, and research.  The trick, I believe, is to
use the computer in ways that it is uniquely suited for, and not
to translate books or musical scores into computer programs with
the same goals and perceived limitations.  Several interesting
uses of computers, in Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) and with
Hypercard Stacks have and are emerging, as well as some
innovative Web page designs, and it is my hope that musicians
will be stimulated by this discussion of Director to keep
developing new tools and paradigms in this area.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section3"><b>3. Files on the Web: Quality, Quantity, and Convenience</b></a></p> 

<p>[3.1] The first consideration for Web authoring is the tradeoff
between the quality of the images or sound viewed and the
quantity and size of files required.  These are in direct
proportion:  the larger the file, the greater the amount of
information, and the better the resulting quality.  However, on
the Web, quantity is also inversely proportional to download time
and ease of use.  Thus, the larger the file, the longer is the
time it takes for the client computer to receive the information
from the server, and the more taxing the requirements of the
downloaded file on the client computer in terms of memory and
processing time.
</p>

<p>[3.2] At least five solutions have arisen in response to this
situation:  1) use of small files with often ingenious solutions
to the limitations and/or acceptance of a lower quality; 2)
development of compression programs that allow files to be sent
in a smaller, compressed form from the server and then be
expanded on the client computer; 3) breaking down of files into
smaller components that are downloaded on demand; 4) linking to
external media such as images, sound, and video (instead of
copying them into a program so they are internal or inline), which
are downloaded separately and on demand; and 5) streaming of
files that only need to be partially downloaded before
functioning, particularly with sound and video files, which tend
to be large.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  Director&rsquo;s Web design incorporates all of these
solutions but allows for less reliance on the first solution than
has been the case on the Web.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>4. Sound on the Computer from the Web</b></a></p> 

<p>[4.1] As those with experience creating or receiving sound on
personal computers from the Web can attest, it is often an
apparently chancy and unpredictable procedure.  Why is this the
case?  Transmitting images and texts on Web pages works almost
100% of the time, but sound requires a few conditions be set.
Director&rsquo;s Shockwave plug-in handles the sound playback
requirements for the most part, but it is useful to know a bit
about sound files on the Web to use sound efficiently.
</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="headlam_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="headlam_ex1small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[4.2] Sound files have several forms.  First, as relatively large
files, they contain numbers that are representations of actual
sound signals, carrying information about amplitude and time
dimensions created from an Analog to Digital converter.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Sound files are in two sections, a header containing information
relating to the control and format of the data, and the data
itself.  The header features control settings such as whether the
sound is mono or stereo, what the maximum amplitude is, what the
sample rate is, what the bit rate is, etc..  The remainder of the
file, the raw sound data, is interpreted according to the
settings in the header.  To hear the sound, the numbers must be
fed into a Digital-to-Analog converter to convert numbers to
electrical signals that can be processed into sound, similarly to
a home stereo setup with a CD player.  This setup is included in
most computers sold within the last few years, which all have
CD-ROMS, but the client computer and its browser must also have
some sort of program or plug-in to interpret the sound file
properly and link up with the computer&rsquo;s sound hardware.  Using
Netscape, useful plug-ins related to sound are Quicktime from
Apple (<b>Example 1</b>), and LiveAudio; these programs can handle the
usual .AIF (MacIntosh) and .WAV (Window) sound file formats, as
well as others.  Director has its own sound format, .SWA, which
is incorporated into its Shockwave plug-in.
</p>

<p>[4.3] When discussing digital sound quality, reference is made to
bits, bytes, and samples:  the more bits, bytes, and samples in
the representation, the better the sound quality and the larger
the file.  The standard Web sound quality, 8-bit and 22050 (or
less) sample rate, is intolerable for musicians, but it is used
because a mono sound file of 8-bit, 22050 samples (uncompressed)
takes about 22 Kilobytes (KB) per second or 1.3 Megabytes (MB)
per minute, while a CD-quality stereo 16-bit, 44100 sample file
takes 166.4 KB per second or about 10 MB per minute in size.  A
mono 16/44100 file, perfectly acceptable, is 88.2 KB/s or about 5
MB/m, but a good compromise file size is mono 16/22050, which
requires 44 KB/s or 2.5 MB/m.  Even though sound files are
compressed, with ratios of 3:1 or 4:1 common, they are still
relatively large.  With download times of, on average:  1
KB/second for a 14.4 Kilobit (Kb) modem, 3 KB/second for 28.8 Kb
modem, 5 KB/second for a 64 Kbs connection, and about 30
KB/second for higher speed connections, such as the T1 connection
often found in universities, sizes of sound files are a constant
consideration.
</p>
 
<p>[4.4] To get sound files to a more manageable size, several
compression procedures are used, which cut down on the amount of
numbers used to represent the signal.  Audio compression is a
complex topic beyond the bounds of this article, but Director and
Sound Edit 16 have a particularly good compression feature in
Shockwave Audio (discussed below), which allows for an acceptable
quality of 16 bit/22050 sample, and provides for at least a 6:1
compression ratio (compressed file is 1/6 the size of the
original).
</p>

<p>[4.5] Other common types of sound files are Midi (Musical
Instrument Digital Interface) files, that contain no information
about the actual sound and so are quite compact, and files like
Mod files that contain mostly Midi-type information but also a
few sound samples.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  Midi files have the advantage of being
small, as they contain only information about frequency,
duration, attack, articulation, etc.  The disadvantage is that
the resulting sound is entirely the result of the client computer
system, which can be good or bad, depending on the prescence of
synthesized sound sources.  One useful development is the
inclusion of a software synthesizer in Apple&rsquo;s Quicktime 2.5, so
that Midi files can play directly through the MacIntosh&rsquo;s Sound
Manager.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  Director can use the same Midi tools as Apple&rsquo;s
Hypercard, as part of its overall compatibility with Hypercard
Xcommands.  Mod files and others with a few sounds and lots of
control instructions have been staples of computer games for
years; they allow the author to control the resulting sound and
have small file sizes.  There is no record of Director uses of
Mod files, at least that I have found, but they might be useful
when specific sounds are desired for extensive sounds.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>5. Web authoring: Browsers and HTML</b></a></p>

<p>[5.1] Web Browsers all read HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), a
language consisting of a simple set of controls over data.
Rather than include graphics and sound files within one file,
HTML files include only instructions and text; other elements are
called when needed from their resting places in the same folder
as the HTML file.  With this architecture, HTML files can be
quite small and thus transfer quickly over the internet.
</p>
 
<p>[5.2] HTML is basically a labeling language, but has associated
scripting and programming languages like CGI, Perl, Java, and
JavaScript.  These allow for more complex interactions between
the browser and the file, and for more interesting Web pages than
the standard static page available with simple HTML commands.
Currently Java applets, small programs that are compiled and run
on the client computer, and Director Shockwave movies are the
most common applications used for creating Web pages that combine
sound, image, animation, and text.  When, as is the case with
Director movies, files sent over the Internet have more complex
control sections, and use different proprietary command
structures, the browser may need plug-ins to run or display them.
Director&rsquo;s plug-in is called Shockwave; by using Shockwave from
within Director, self-contained file is created which consists of
controls and resources (such as images, movies, etc.)  that are
either placed within the file or are outside and are called when
required (like HTML).  The Director movie is called from within
an HTML file using an EMBED command (described below).  Linked
sounds (.SWA files) and images (.GIF files) do not require a
separate HTML file, but currently linked video must be called
from within a separate HTML file.
</p>
 

<p>[5.3] Readers running Netscape should look at their plug-ins.  Go
to the Finder and look inside the Netscape folder for
the plug-ins folder and look inside at the plug-in programs
available (Example 1 above).  You will probably see Quicktime and
LiveAudio&mdash;other plug-ins may be downloaded from various places
on the Web.  In the next section of this paper, you will put the Shockwave 
plug-in this folder.  Back to Netscape.  In Netscape,
open up Options; then General Preferences, and
then helpers (<b>Example 2</b>).  A list of helper applications that
call plug-in programs appears; it will probably also include
Quicktime and LiveAudio.  Click on one plug-in line and then edit
to see the details (<b>Example 3</b>):  the code names for the
application and the file extensions or suffixes, such as .mid for
Midi files and .dcr, .dir, .dxr for Director.  These extensions
are very important, as they tell the browser what type of file
needs to be interpreted.

<p>[7.1] Director, as the name implies, uses the metaphor of a movie
for file creation.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>  A director movie that is itself an
introduction to Director is provided in <b>Example 6</b>.  Go through the movie
and refer to it for the following.  Each element in the movie, an
image, text, sound, or video, is called a cast member; when it
sits in reserve in a cast library; and a sprite; when it is
actually onstage;&mdash;the screen space allotted for the movie&mdash;and
part of the action.  The sprite corresponding to a cast member is
independent and can be altered in many aspects (size, color,
etc.), without affecting the original cast member, which acts as
a template.  Up to 32,000 cast members can be ready for use in a
movie (using linked libraries), with up to 120 sprites possible
on the stage at one time.  Successive events&mdash;combinations of
sprites&mdash;happen in frames; placed within a score; which controls
the action.  Each element, the frame, the score, the sprites, and
cast members, can all have scripts or sets of commands associated
with them, activated automatically within the movie or by the
user.  Pre-set scripts called behaviors; are included, but these
can be altered and new scripts written.  The user interacts by
clicking on sprites, which can be buttons or hot; spots; as with
Web pages, it is possible to indicate to the user where to click
by changing the cursor to a hand; at those places.
</p>
 
<p>[7.2] Director&rsquo;s design gives the author a choice of two levels
for creating presentations:  1) using prepared scripts
called behaviors; and 2) writing new scripts.  Script is a general
term denoting a programming language that is created to use
common language references, such asset the text of castmember &lsquo;x&rsquo;
to &lsquo;I love ice cream,&rsquo; rather than the more complex allotment of
variables, types, and memory locations found in C or C++ or other
similar programs.  While easier to use than programming
languages, scripting retains certain features, such as &ldquo;if then .
.  &rdquo;; and &ldquo;while&rdquo; loop constructions, and the ancestor - parent -
child metaphor of object-oriented programs.  Director&rsquo;s
programming language is called Lingo.  The standardized behavior
scripts allow for application of scripts and interaction without
independent programming, but those interested in programming can
add their own scripts to govern the actions of sprites, etc.  in
the course of the movie.  Since the behavior scripts have only
appeared in the latest version of Director, 6.0, anyone who has
used Director has already learned scripting, which was required
of the author in earlier versions.
</p>
 
<div style="width:300px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 7</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="headlam_examples.php?id=6&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 7 thumbnail" src="headlam_ex7small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>[7.3] Movies with behavior scripts only are generally created
manually, using the changing relationships of sprites in the flow
of frames implied in the movie metaphor.  Cast members&mdash;images,
text, etc.&mdash;are either imported or created within Director, using
its Paint and Field tools, and put in a list of cast members,
then dragged and arranged on a stage as sprites.  Successive
movie frames; are similarly arranged, with a few behavior scripts
to create animations.  The introductory movie shown above has few
scripts, consisting mostly of 1) &ldquo;wait&rdquo; type commands, which
stops the movie by causing it to replay the same frame until the
user clicks; and 2) &ldquo;go to&rdquo; type commands that send the movie to
a different frame when the user clicks.  Another movie (see <b>Example 7</b>) with
minimal scripting is one I created for a multi-media class at
Eastman, with general information on computers and multi-media.
The only scripts are &ldquo;go to&rdquo; types and &ldquo;wait until user does
something&rdquo; types.
</p>

<p>[7.4] When the movie is run, the frames run sequentially at
speeds of 1 to 30 frames per second, allowing for animation or
sequences of events similar to a movie reel.  In frame-by-frame
animation (see <b>Example 8</b>), the frame succession is clear when the tempo, or frame
rate, of the movie is slowed.  Frames can be looped to wait for
user-activated buttons or hot; spots:  these interactive elements
allow the user to jump around between frames and control the pace
or order of the movie, depending on its design.  A simple
interactive movie (see <b>Example 9</b>) allows users to alternate between images.
Simple movies with animation are small, easy to create and
compile, and can be found in many places on the Web.

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section8"><b>8. Music Analysis on the Web with minimal Scripting: An Example</b></a></p> 

<div style="width:300px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 10</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="headlam_examples.php?id=9&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 10 thumbnail" src="headlam_ex10small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch video)</font></p></div>

<p>[8.1] As a simple example of music analysis using a Director
movie with minimal scripting, I offer a study of Los muertos
illvan alas de musgo, a madrigal by George Crumb (see <b>Example 10</b>).  The Director
movie of this analysis was created with 1) a Finale file of the
score, which was imported into Director as the notes only, and
the staves only, the two are combined in the movie, but having
them as separate cast members allows for manipulations (such as
coloring) on the notes alone; 2) colored cast members taken from
the notes cast member; 3) a separate analytical stave; and 4) a
sound file of the song, in this case a performance conducted by
the author.
</p>

<p>[8.2] The tricky part was to get the scrolling of the score to
coincide with the music:  the corresponding cast members of the
score and notes were lined up and placed in successive frames on
the stage to line up approximately with the flow of the music.
As the score scrolls by, colored cast members are placed on the
score, then moved up to the analytical layer to show the analysis
develop in real time.  The advantage is that the harmonies
(pitch-class sets) are coordinated with colors, and that the
student can listen to the score and start, stop, and pause the
music and score for study.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>  The scripts are minimal for this
movie, which is based on the frame-by-frame succession that is
the essence of Director movies, and consist only of restart and
pause controls, which are toggled when the user clicks on the
stage, and the stop/restart button on the stage.
</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section9"><b>9. Scripting</b></a></p> 

<p>[9.1] Scripted movies have the advantage that a small number of
elements may be manipulated in different ways by controls in the
script, so that the size of the file is smaller than if the
elements were copies and manipulated manually.  Director&rsquo;s
language, Lingo, is somewhat similar to Hypercard&rsquo;s Hyperscript
and has features found in many scripting languages.  Every
element of a movie has a controlling script which may be defined
using program handlers that begin with the word on:  from the
movie itself (on startMovie), to frames (on enterFrame, on
exitFrame), to cast members, sprites, and interactive buttons and
hot spots (on mouseUp, on mouseDown).  In addition to the program
handlers provided within Director, users may write their own
handlers, which are similar to functions in programs like C and
Pascal, and either perform a task or take a value, change it, and
return a value.  Variables may used locally, or defined as global
and used in different handlers.
</p>

<p>[9.2] The script of Lingo can be divided into at least nine
categories:  1) decision scripts:  mathematical symbols, numbers,
operators such as = or &lt;&gt; (not equals); &ldquo;if - then &mdash; else if -
then &mdash; else&rdquo; loops; &ldquo;repeat while&rdquo; or &ldquo;repeat with&rdquo; loops; 2)
function scripts:  handlers which perform a task, or take a
value, perform an operation, and return a value; 3)
classification scripts:  define local variables, global
variables, lists, put and set commands which assign values; 4)
control and program handler scripts:  scripts that run the
program and connect with the computer, such as abort, exit,
start, alert, mouseDown, KeyDown, button scripts, menus, sorts;
5) location scripts:  setting the location of sprites; on the
stage:  top, bottom, right, left, location of mouse when clicking
on stage; 6) attributes scripts:  setting other attributes of
elements than location:  color, blend, height, number, name,
type; 7) text-related scripts:  identifying characters, words,
lines, whether text field is editable by user, length; 8)
connection scripts:  connecting to other programs, files, desk
accessories, resedit manipulations, Xlibraries, File Input/Output
(I/O), etc.; 9) creation scripts:  object-oriented programming
elements:  ancestors, parents, children; 10) Web and
network-related scripts:  controlling Web and networking
features.

<p>[10.1] A typical freshman homework assignment using a scripted
Director movie is given (see <b>Example 11</b>), with the first eight bars of Schubert&rsquo;s
Moment Musicale op.  94/6 as the passage.  The movie involves 
1) the use of a notation program such as Finale to notate the
musical passage, a reduction of the passage as the answer (if
desired), and a blank stave of the same size as the reduction for
the students to enter their answers to a counterpoint-type
question; 2) a Roman Numeral, Arabic number, and note head
repository for analysis; 3) color flags and text field to label
non-chord tones; and 4) a sound file of the passage, the movie
includes a sound file of the outer voices for the answer.  For
the first question, the passage appears on the stage, and the
student can first listen to the passage, then arrange Roman
Numerals and Arabic numbers in the proper place, and then move
color flags over non-chord tones and label them.  For the second
question, on a blank stave, the student can arrange notes and
numbers to show underlying counterpoint and/or a reduction of the
harmonies.  When done, if desired, the student can check the
answer.  To hand the assignment in, the student makes snapshots
of the screen (command-shift-3 with any Macintosh after Operating
System 7.01) showing the answer to question 1 then question 2;
the snapshot saves a picture of the screen as a PICT file to the
desktop.  The student then labels the two pictures with his/her
name, and puts them in a homework folder.
</p>

<p>[10.2] A non-working version of the movie showing the separate
elements is included (see <b>Example 12</b>).  To create the movie, the main cast
members, the score and staves, are exported from Finale as PICT
files (an image format that Director supports).  First, import
the files into Director as cast members, and size the stage at
432 X 455 pixels (for a 17 inch monitor, 464 X 310 for 15 inch).
For Question 1, put the notation cast member on the stage.  To
create the Roman numeral, Arabic number, and note repository, use
fields and type in the numerals and numbers, but use texts for
the quarter note heads and sharp, natural, and flat signs (using
a font like Petrucci).  Fields are more flexible, but require
that the user has the same fonts as the author&mdash;so they should be
set up so that the font doesn&rsquo;t really matter; texts are treated
like bitmap images so the user won&rsquo;t need the Petrucci or other
notational font.  To complete the cast, using the Paint tool,
make a small colored circle to use for non-chord tones.  Arrange
the Roman Numerals and Figures and symbols on the stage.  For
each sprite, check the moveable box so that the user can move the
symbol.  Create a field for the student to add the names of
non-chord tones, and fields explaining what the student is to do.
Finally, add navigational buttons, to move to different frames.
When allowing for interaction, use &ldquo;go to the frame&rdquo; in the frame
script, as this allows the movie to keep running and accepting
mouse clicks etc. (the use of &ldquo;pause&rdquo; stops the movie).  For
Question 2 and the answer, follow a similar procedure.
</p>
 
<p>[10.3] A working version of the movie showing its scripts is also
included (see <b>Example 13</b>)&mdash;the main movie script is given in the top right hand
field, changing scripts according to what sprite is clicked are
given in the lower right field.  These fields may be moved by
dragging with the mouse.
</p>
 
<p>[10.4] When scripting a movie, it is easiest to place all handlers
in &ldquo;Movie&rdquo; scripts, under a general global line, so that the
global variables are available to all handlers, with calls to the
handlers in the scripts of the various corresponding sprites,
frames, etc.  This avoids the common problem of undefined global
variables&mdash;a situation which causes errors not always clearly
articulated by Director&rsquo;s automatic de-bugging features.
The Movie script; sets up several groups of variables, beginning
with IH, IIH, etc., which are variables set to the initial
locations of many sprites (necessary for the script when they
move and recreate themselves as the user performs the analysis).
The next variables (scroll down in the upper right hand box to
see these) are for two lists, then for counters also used in the
move/recreate scripts.  Global variables for the sound follow.
The &ldquo;on startMovie&rdquo; handler sets up the initial values for
locations and counter global variables.  It also initially sets
all sprites visible, as some are made invisible in the course of
the movie, but toward the end another handler called
&ldquo;nonvissprites1&rdquo; makes the sprites corresponding to question 2
invisible, since the user will presumably start with question 1.
(If the user goes to question 2 first, a script along the way
will make the relevant sprites visible.)  It also erases all cast
members past a certain number:  this is the number of functioning
cast members, until users start to perform the analyses, then
more cast members are created.  Every time the movie is
restarted, the excess cast members are deleted.
</p>
 
<p>[10.5] The essential script for all the moving sprites (the roman
numerals, etc.)  is &ldquo;dupandmove,&rdquo; placed within the movie script.
Move one of the Roman Numerals to show this script, then look in
the lower right field.  The &ldquo;if ..  then&rdquo; script is a test:  if
the sprite has been moved from its original location, then it
will not duplicate itself; this is so that users can adjust the
Roman Numerals, etc.  they have already placed in the score.  If
the sprite has not been moved, then the handler &ldquo;dupandmove&rdquo; is
invoked.  This script, shown in the upper right hand field,
duplicates the cast member corresponding to the sprite, assigning
the duplicate all the attributes of the original (all the &ldquo;set
the&rdquo; lines in the script) so that there is an apparently endless
supply of numerals and figures.  In fact, the duplicate replaces
a dummy sprite that is sitting unnoticed on the stage, starting
with sprite 120 and moving backwards by the incremented value of
a counter variable x.  There is a total of 120-(the number of
functioning cast members) of these dummy sprites, allowing for
around 60 copies of the Roman Numerals, etc.  The script places
the duplicate at the same place as the original, while the
original is free to move away.
</p>
 
<p>[10.6] The trick in the script is to duplicate the cast member
(the Roman numeral, etc.)  only the first time the sprite is
clicked&mdash;after it is moved, the user should be able to move it
again without creating another duplicate.  As noted above, this
is the purpose of the location test beginning the script in each
of these moving sprites, as seen in the lower field on the stage.
If the sprite is at the original location, it will create a
duplicate; if it has been moved once, it will not.
</p>
 
<p>[10.7] The handler &ldquo;dupandmove&rdquo; also includes &ldquo;puppetSprite&rdquo;
commands.  To alter the condition of a sprite from the script, it
is necessary to use a &ldquo;puppetSprite spriteNumber, TRUE or FALSE&rdquo;
command.  All elements, sounds, transitions, palettes, etc.  may
be changed with Lingo, with the corresponding &lsquo;puppet command
(&ldquo;puppetSound,&rdquo; etc.).  When changing any sprite attributes, it
is also necessary to end the handler with &ldquo;upDateStage&rdquo; or to use
&ldquo;go to the frame&rdquo; in the frame script to register the
change&mdash;this movie uses the latter.
</p>
 
<p>[10.8] A problem with the &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; commands within Director lead
to the &ldquo;visible&rdquo; sprite handlers, &ldquo;vissprites&rdquo; and
&ldquo;nonvissprites.&rdquo;  To see these handlers, click on one of the
navigation buttons:  &ldquo;question 2&rdquo; or &ldquo;Answer.&rdquo;  A channel or
sprite that is puppeted will persist on the stage even when it is
not in the score; thus, it needs to be made invisible when not
required.  The &ldquo;vissprites&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonvissprites&rdquo; handlers set the
sprites corresponding to question 1 visible or invisible, while
the &ldquo;vissprites1&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonvissprites1&rdquo; handlers set the
visibility of sprites corresponding to question 2.  Two lists are
created to catalogue the sprites from these two questions:
Q1List and Q2List.  At the end of the &ldquo;dupandmove&rdquo; handler, the
duplicated sprite number is put into the corresponding list, and
the numbers in the list are used in the &ldquo;visible&rdquo; handlers.
These handlers also include the sprite numbers corresponding to
the original movable sprites (the Roman numerals, etc.), which
also must be made visible or invisible, since they are also
puppeted.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section11"><b>11. Streaming Audio</b></a></p> 

<p>[11.1] Director movies may also include sound files.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>  With
Director on the Web as Shockwave, having relatively large sound
files embedded in the program causes slow download problems.  One
solution is to use Macromedia&rsquo;s streaming audio format, which
comes with an efficient compression of at least 6:1.  Using this
compression, sound files embedded in the movie are smaller, and
can be used normally.  When files are still quite large, it is
also possible to link to external sound files and play them
during the movie.  This is the technique in the assignment
analysis movie:  the sound is played with the &ldquo;Listen&rdquo; button,
which activates a specially prepared compressed sound file,
&ldquo;schubert.swa,&rdquo; that sits outside the movie and is called when
needed.  The handler is set in the movie script, and the sound is
called by the button script, with the handler &ldquo;playswa.&rdquo;  With
this streaming audio, a buffer is created and the downloading
sound file is played when the buffer is full, generally about 5
seconds.  As the file continues to download, it simultaneously
plays.
</p>

<p>[11.2] Returning to the homework assignment, to complete the
steps for creating the movie, prepare a sound file of the
passage, using a program like Sound-Edit 16 (also made by
Macromedia), to create a mono file, 16-bit and 22050 samples.
Use the SWA Compression Xtra in Soundedit and the SWA Settings
Xtra for Director to compress the sound.  The sound is given a
corresponding dummy cast member, called &ldquo;SWAHolder,&rdquo; and the name
of the sound file is assigned in the &ldquo;on startMovie&rdquo; handler.
The sound handlers then take this sound file and play it, with a
few configuration features.  The sound can be heard any number of
times by pressing the corresponding button.  A second sound in
this example is a reduction to the two outer voices.  Both of
these sounds were created first as Midi files, then altered to
.AIF format sound files using Quicktime&rsquo;s MoviePlayer, then Sound
Edit 16 to change the sounds into compressed .SWA files.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section12"><b>12. More on Shockwave: Web Programming.</b></a></p> 

<p>[12.1] Shockwave, both a process and plug-in for putting Director
movies on the Web, was introduced in October 1995, and is
available for Windows or Macintosh computers, and for Web
browsers Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Since Shockwave introduces a new MIME type, .DCR, the server must
be configured, and the client browser must be configured with the
plug-in and helper type (as discussed above).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>  To create
Shockwave movies, Director uses Xtras contained in folders called
&ldquo;media,&rdquo; which contain Xtras related to streaming audio, and net
support, which contain Xtras related to Shockwave movies on the
Web.  Director 5.0 had an Xtra called &ldquo;Afterburner&rdquo; to create
shocked movies, but Director 6 has a built-in &ldquo;Create Shockwave
Movies&rdquo; choice in the file menu, which creates a file ending with
.DCR.  Shocked movies are placed within HTML documents.  The
basic EMBED tag is:  &lt;EMBED SRC=&ldquo;movieName.drc&rdquo;
WIDTH=widthInPixels HEIGHT=heightInPixels&gt;.
</p>

<p>[12.2] The first rule of Web programming with Shockwave is to
start with the smallest movie possible:  if the movie is large,
divide it into smaller movies that call one another, or begin
with an introductory movie that consists of only an image which
displays while other movies load (using the &ldquo;GoToNetMovie&rdquo;
script).  The second rule is be clear on pathnames and file
names.  Director&rsquo;s lingo, the pathName, is disabled in Shockwave,
and the movie and supporting files all need to be in the same
folder or directory and properly labelled.  Files names have
different restrictions on different platforms:  UNIX servers are
case-sensitive; Windows machines may have trouble with names
longer than eight characters with a three character extension or
names with spaces.  These two and MacIntosh may have trouble with
special characters in file names.
</p>
 
<p>[12.3] As with sound, color and graphics are complex topics unto
themselves when it comes to size, quality, and compression.  The
safest route is to use the System Color Palettes and the smallest
bit size for images that provides a clear image:  the difference
between 8 bit and 16 bit color is noticeable, but the former is
acceptable.  Use text fields if possible, with standard fonts:
the client computer must have the same fonts to get the same text
shape and size.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup>  Director automatically substitutes between
standard MacIntosh and Windows fonts.  Text created in the text
cast members is bitmapped and takes more space, but the client
does not need the same fonts, and so the effect can be assured.
</p>

<p>[12.4] When putting Director movies into shocked form on the Web,
important considerations are:  1) data transmission rates; 2) New
Lingo commands; 3) Director features disabled; and 4)
miscellaneous issues that affect playing Director movies in a
browser.  Data transmission on the Web is, from a hardware point
of view, standardized, with user modem speeds of 14.4 kilobits
(Kb) per second (= 1.8 KB/s), 28.8 Kb/s (3.6 KB/s), 33.6 Kb/s
(4.2 KB/s), and 56 Kb/s (7 KB/s).  Higher speeds come from ISDN
lines, ranging from 64 Kb/s (8 KB/s) to 1.5 Megabits (Mb)/s (184
KB/s), and T1 lines at 1.544 Mb/s (193 KB/s), Ethernet at 10 Mb/s
(1.25 MegaBytes (MB)/s), and T3 lines at 44.736 Mb/s (5.592
MB/s).  Over the internet, however, these theoretical speeds are
affected by the data transmission capacity of server computers
and by how busy the server and the lines between server and
client are at that moment&mdash;a very unpredictable value.  A given
speed estimate for general use is about 1 KB/s.  By taking the
size of the movie and supporting files, approximate download
times can be calculated.  The most important advances for data
transmission are streaming versions of data:  Shocked movies and
audio are both streaming, but streaming video is not incorporated
into Director, although Quicktime movies, which are linked to
from within shocked movies, are now streaming.
</p>
 
<p>[12.5] Other concerns to users of Director are the features not
available in Shockwave form, and the new Lingo scripts required
by Net form.  Features not available are mostly those related to
operating systems:  custom menus, printing, saving, restarting,
resources, file I/O etc., but also include movies within windows.
The Web-related Lingo commands are in three categories:  those
that start a process, those that monitor it, and those that send
or receive a result once the process is done.  This three-step
set-up accommodates the essentially asynchronous Internet, where
the time to send and receive data is unpredictable.  Finally, a
concern at all times on computers is the amount of free memory:
Shocked movies on top of Web Browsers take up enormous resources,
and the use of multimedia files can easily (on the MacIntosh at
least) cause system crashes.  While new versions of operating
systems and internet protocols help this situation, it is always
a concern when sending large and complex files over the Web.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section13"><b>13. Conclusion</b></a></p> 

<p>[13.1] As I noted at the outset, the availability of powerful
computers linked on the Web offers many possibilities, but also
pitfalls.  The most basic opposition here is technique versus
content.  It is easy (remarkably easy!)  to become absorbed in
the how rather than the why and what when working with computers.
This situation is the result of many factors.  First, although
the Web is meant to be platform independent, in reality, each of
the major systems, from Apple, Microsoft and the IBM clones, Sun,
and SGI, has its own characteristic ways of interacting with
the Web.  Thus, authors must learn different programming
languages and codes.  Currently, for instance, Microsoft has its
own brand of HTML, different for its browser, called Internet
Explorer, than that used on the browser, Netscape Navigator, so
that some web pages or features cannot be read by both programs.
Although Director is useful since its Shockwave movies are
playable on MacIntosh or Windows machines, in the latter case,
users must have sound cards properly installed and overcome some
difficulties in the plug-and-play; features to hear musical
files.  As well, servers are often Unix based machines.  In my
own efforts, I discovered that, while upper case or lower case
letters in file names and links are equivalent on the MacIntosh,
on the UNIX server a reference to a file with a different
configuration of lower or upper case letters failed to find the
file, and I had to redo some links and code.
</p>
 
<p>[13.2] Second, since in the marketing of computer programs,
prices must go down with successive generations of more powerful
systems, companies dole out versions of software yearly that
users are required to purchase to keep up.  Although Director is
useful, for instance, the initial cost is high (around $800)
until the educational versions come out, usually a year or two
later.  The educational version of Director 5, for around $75,
was available only a few months before Director 6.0 came out.
After the initial outlay, while upgrades are not too expensive,
the price dissuades many authors.  In my case, I learned the
Shockwave version of Director 5.0 by cobbling together elements
from books and the Web; in Director 6.0, these elements have been
integrated into the program&mdash;but with some elements now changed
from the Afterburner; generation.  Such changes make working in
multi-media exasperating.
</p>
 
<p>[13.3] Third, to create worthwhile educational content for the
Web, instructors have to re-imagine their course material, or
invent new courses, appropriate for the new medium.  Putting
class notes and schedules in electronic form is convenient, but
hardly represents a new use for computers.  What is the criteria
for useful Web texts?  At Eastman, only a relatively small
proportion of students have web access, so it is difficult to do
tests with large groups.  I have just begun to use web pages in
my own teaching, but in the process of thinking about using the
web and computers, a few important questions have come to mind
and, I believe, need to be considered by all web authors for
educational materials:</p>

<blockquote> 

1) Do the materials use the capabilities of the computer to
combine sound and image?  Image and text alone work quite well in
a book, and sound alone is easily available on CD systems.
Combining images and text, with instant access to both, is a
strength of the computer, and should be the goal of instructional
materials.</blockquote>


<blockquote>2) Are the learning materials goal-directed?  I&rsquo;m not a big fan
of pages full of multiple menu possibilities on successive pages
or teaching materials organized like a game.  Part of teaching is
instructing students in a systematic and goal-oriented way, as
their lack of experience with the material is the reason they&rsquo;re
in the class to begin with:  it is not appropriate to assume that
they will make the best decisions in the order of material.  Web
materials should be efficiently and clearly presented, with the
next step indicated.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>3) Do the assignments or tasks on the Web allow students to learn
at their own pace?  This question requires a well-thought out
interface, with lots of looping connectors so that students can
go back over material and review/rediscover ideas and concepts as
needed.  This potential is also one of the great strengths of the
computer.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>4) Does the program or file point beyond itself, causing the
student to make larger connections?  Self-contained drill type
programs might be of some use in a directed environment, but the
ideal materials should both present the immediate topic and point
(with links) to topics of larger implication.
</blockquote> 
 
<p>[13.4] To the problems of multi-media authoring noted
above&mdash;learning programming languages, Web pages, problems with
multiple platforms and generating sound&mdash;Director offers an
all-in-one solution, and is worth consideration by all those
interested.  Although it has a few quirks, Director is relatively
easy to learn and get fast results with scripts.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>  As for the
often frustrating and time-consuming process of developing
content for the Web, Director can help with the technique, but
the content&mdash;from imagination and an understanding of the
medium&mdash;is the result of hard work and time spent in the
environment.  As operating systems and programs become ever more
closely tied to the Web, with teaching and learning in the
education business inevitably following, all of us will need to
use computers in the most efficient and effective ways possible.</p>

Computer programs such as word processors, webbrowsers, and

download completely and then begin playing, which can take a
lengthy period of time.  Streaming files are created with enough
control information put at the beginning of the file so that the
file can be processed and begin playing or presenting almost
immediately.  The remainder of the file continues to download
into a buffer simultaneously.  The problem is that download times
are unpredictable on the Web and may change even during one
file&rsquo;s download.  Thus, a sound may begin playing, then stop,
while enough information flows into the buffer to continue the
play.  Director&rsquo;s streaming audio allows authors to set the
initial time before the playing begins (default 5 seconds), which
allows some leeway, but there is no fail-safe solution.<br><a href="#FN3REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN4">4.</a> Soundwaves can be described digitally in a Cartesian graph
type format, with x-values as time, measured in small chunks
called samples.  Samples of sounds are taken in fractions of
seconds, usually in 1/22050 or 1/44100&rsquo;s of a second, or 44,100
samples = 44,100 times a second.  The sample rate is twice the
highest frequency possible in the sound represented, thus 44,100
samples per second allows for a frequency of 22050 Hz, or cycles
per second, above most people&rsquo;s range of hearing; 22050 samples
per second allows for 11025 Hz frequencies, within the range of
hearing, but is acceptable as a compromise (the piano spans 27.4-
4186 Hz).
<br><br>
 
Computers store information in binary numbers, with each bit set
to either 0 or 1, and in bytes of 8-bits each to store numbers or
words, etc:  8-bits = 1 byte, 16 bit = 2 bytes.  A kilobit (Kb) =
1000 bits, a Kilobyte (KB) = 1000 bytes, a Megabyte (MB) =
1,000,000 bytes.  In the Cartesian graph representation of a
soundfile, y-values are the amplitude levels, measured in
divisions relating to the bits; present in the sound
representation, usually 8 bits (=256 levels) or 16 bits (=16536
levels).  The sound wave is much more faithfully reproduced by
the many more levels in 16 bits, but for size reasons 8-bit sound
has been used on the Web.  The size of sound files (uncompressed)
depends on the bits and samples:  8 bits = 1 byte, so that 8 bit,
22050 sample sound takes about 22 KB per second; CD quality
stereo 16 bit, 44,100 sample sound takes 2 <i> 2 </i> 44,100 = about
166.4 KB per second.

An Analog-to-Digital converter converts a sound signal (trumpet
note, traffic noise) from its electrical representation into a
series of numbers representing the time and amplitude values of
the signal.  A Digital-to-Analog converter reverses the process,
creating sound from a series of binary numbers.<br><a href="#FN4REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN5">5.</a> Midi file information can be found at

unfortunately only allows for the latter.<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN9">9.</a> In non-web uses, sounds can also be placed in the two sound
channels; when the movie plays the frame with the sound file in
it, it will play the sound file.  To coordinate sound with
animation, it is easier to import the sound as a quicktime movie;
quicktime movies can be controlled virtually frame by frame, and
so a quicktime movie sound can also be started and stopped and
accessed at any point easily to coordinate with animation.
Unfortunately, this is not yet possible with linked quicktime
sounds or Director&rsquo;s streaming audio.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> On servers, a file called &ldquo;mime.type&rdquo; (UNIX) contains many

font, Director automatically substitutes a standard Windows
system font when someone runs the movie on a Windows
computer--and vice versa.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> Director has a few quirks that should be noted.  First, the
first frame of a movie often doesn&rsquo;t work properly when sounds or
scripts are present, and it is best to begin in frame 2, leaving
frame 1 either empty, or with the same stage as frame 2 without
the sounds, scripts, or markers, so that the movie begins and
passes through at least one unscripted frame before the action
begins.  Second, the last frame of a movie needs to be considered
carefully, otherwise the movie will just end; often, the ;last;
frame loops, waiting for a user click.  Third, repeat loops and
pauses shut out the user (and, in Web pages, the browser as well)
and should be used carefully; options should be given to stop any
lengthy activity.  Fourth, when using text, use ;field; cast
members for general text but use a standard font, since client
computers will only show fonts that they have mounted; for
specific fonts or text arrangements, use ;text; cast members,
which are read as bitmaps.  Fifth, when done making a movie, it
is often convenient to get rid of unused Cast members by opening
the Find command, which has a setting ;not used in movie.; The
list of members includes movie and frame scripts however, which
must be kept.  It is thus best to name these scripts to avoid a
tedious search to be sure which cast members may be deleted.
There are also a few general quirks of computer programs to
remember.  For instance, when using linked media, make the link
to a copy of the image or sound, etc., because any changes made
within, in this case, Director, will change the source media.

download completely and then begin playing, which can take a
lengthy period of time.  Streaming files are created with enough
control information put at the beginning of the file so that the
file can be processed and begin playing or presenting almost
immediately.  The remainder of the file continues to download
into a buffer simultaneously.  The problem is that download times
are unpredictable on the Web and may change even during one
file&rsquo;s download.  Thus, a sound may begin playing, then stop,
while enough information flows into the buffer to continue the
play.  Director&rsquo;s streaming audio allows authors to set the
initial time before the playing begins (default 5 seconds), which
allows some leeway, but there is no fail-safe solution.</div><div id="fndiv4" class="flyoverdiv">Soundwaves can be described digitally in a Cartesian graph
type format, with x-values as time, measured in small chunks
called samples.  Samples of sounds are taken in fractions of
seconds, usually in 1/22050 or 1/44100&rsquo;s of a second, or 44,100
samples = 44,100 times a second.  The sample rate is twice the
highest frequency possible in the sound represented, thus 44,100
samples per second allows for a frequency of 22050 Hz, or cycles
per second, above most people&rsquo;s range of hearing; 22050 samples
per second allows for 11025 Hz frequencies, within the range of
hearing, but is acceptable as a compromise (the piano spans 27.4-
4186 Hz).

Computers store information in binary numbers, with each bit set
to either 0 or 1, and in bytes of 8-bits each to store numbers or
words, etc:  8-bits = 1 byte, 16 bit = 2 bytes.  A kilobit (Kb) =
1000 bits, a Kilobyte (KB) = 1000 bytes, a Megabyte (MB) =
1,000,000 bytes.  In the Cartesian graph representation of a
soundfile, y-values are the amplitude levels, measured in
divisions relating to the bits; present in the sound
representation, usually 8 bits (=256 levels) or 16 bits (=16536
levels).  The sound wave is much more faithfully reproduced by
the many more levels in 16 bits, but for size reasons 8-bit sound
has been used on the Web.  The size of sound files (uncompressed)
depends on the bits and samples:  8 bits = 1 byte, so that 8 bit,
22050 sample sound takes about 22 KB per second; CD quality
stereo 16 bit, 44,100 sample sound takes 2 <i> 2 </i> 44,100 = about
166.4 KB per second.

An Analog-to-Digital converter converts a sound signal (trumpet
note, traffic noise) from its electrical representation into a
series of numbers representing the time and amplitude values of
the signal.  A Digital-to-Analog converter reverses the process,
creating sound from a series of binary numbers.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">Midi file information can be found at

found at:  <a href='http://quicktime.apple.com'>http://quicktime.apple.com</a>.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Although useful by itself, Director may also be ordered in a
Studio, bundled with a sound editing program, SoundEdit 16, an
image editor, xRes 3, and a 3D tool, Extreme 3D 2, for a complete
multimedia package.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">In the original CD-ROM version of this movie, the sound is a
quicktime movie, and can be accessed at any point, as well as
stopped, started, and paused.  Director&rsquo;s streaming audio
unfortunately only allows for the latter.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">In non-web uses, sounds can also be placed in the two sound
channels; when the movie plays the frame with the sound file in
it, it will play the sound file.  To coordinate sound with
animation, it is easier to import the sound as a quicktime movie;
quicktime movies can be controlled virtually frame by frame, and
so a quicktime movie sound can also be started and stopped and
accessed at any point easily to coordinate with animation.
Unfortunately, this is not yet possible with linked quicktime
sounds or Director&rsquo;s streaming audio.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">On servers, a file called &ldquo;mime.type&rdquo; (UNIX) contains many
file types; add the line:  application/x-director dcr, dir, dxr.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">The standard system fonts:  Arial, Courier New, Symbol,
Times New Roman, and Wingdings on Windows and Chicago, Courier,
Geneva, Helvetica, Monaco, New York, Palatino, Symbol, and Times
on the Macintosh.  If you choose a standard Macintosh system
font, Director automatically substitutes a standard Windows
system font when someone runs the movie on a Windows
computer--and vice versa.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Director has a few quirks that should be noted.  First, the
first frame of a movie often doesn&rsquo;t work properly when sounds or
scripts are present, and it is best to begin in frame 2, leaving
frame 1 either empty, or with the same stage as frame 2 without
the sounds, scripts, or markers, so that the movie begins and
passes through at least one unscripted frame before the action
begins.  Second, the last frame of a movie needs to be considered
carefully, otherwise the movie will just end; often, the ;last;
frame loops, waiting for a user click.  Third, repeat loops and
pauses shut out the user (and, in Web pages, the browser as well)
and should be used carefully; options should be given to stop any
lengthy activity.  Fourth, when using text, use ;field; cast
members for general text but use a standard font, since client
computers will only show fonts that they have mounted; for
specific fonts or text arrangements, use ;text; cast members,
which are read as bitmaps.  Fifth, when done making a movie, it
is often convenient to get rid of unused Cast members by opening
the Find command, which has a setting ;not used in movie.; The
list of members includes movie and frame scripts however, which
must be kept.  It is thus best to name these scripts to avoid a
tedious search to be sure which cast members may be deleted.
There are also a few general quirks of computer programs to
remember.  For instance, when using linked media, make the link
to a copy of the image or sound, etc., because any changes made
within, in this case, Director, will change the source media.
