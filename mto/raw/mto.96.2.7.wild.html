<p style="text-align: center"><b>1. Introduction</b></p>

<p>[1.1] Music-theoretical endeavors vary greatly in their breadth. 
At one end of the spectrum are accounts of a particular 
composer&rsquo;s technique within a particular piece; at the other, 
attempts to answer the most general questions about how music 
works. As an investigator&rsquo;s aims tend toward the latter end of 
the continuum, he or she must explore a larger and larger 
repertoire. Compounded with the level of intimacy with musical 
details that a systematic inquiry can require, a large body of 
music can quickly exceed the capacity of one scholarly lifetime. 
An indispensable step in pursuing this broader type of research 
is thus the accumulation and maintenance of a large, searchable 
computer database of music. Even the study of repertoires of 
manageable size is more flexibly undertaken when digital 
representation and automated manipulation of the music is 
available.

<p>

[1.2] The Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities 
(CCARH) at Stanford has an ongoing musical database project; 
among other items virtually all of J. S. Bach&rsquo;s oeuvre has been 
electronically encoded. Of vital importance to such a task&rsquo;s 
usefulness is the format of musical representation within the 
database. As the success of computer-assisted musicology 
becomes more widely apparent, musical representation schemes are 
likely to proliferate, jockeying for position until such time as 
some sort of standard is agreed upon. The evaluation of 
representation schemes has been a hot topic in the 
not-so-distant past;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> however, most 
of the schemes discussed 
were designed to aid composers of computer music, whose 
requirements do not necessarily intersect with those of 
investigative scholars. In CCARH&rsquo;s database, several formats 
for encoding music are employed concurrently, all subsets of 
CCARH&rsquo;s master representation MuseData. The structure of the 
database and the aims of the various schemes have been described 
elsewhere; most promising among the schemes is the Humdrum 
representation, designed by David Huron.

<p style="text-align: center"><b>2. Humdrum</b></p>

<p>

[2] Humdrum comprises two distinct aspects, corresponding to the 
representation and manipulation of musical data. First, there 
is the syntax defined for representing discrete information as a 
series of records in a computer file. Its definition allows for 
many kinds of information to be encoded; the scheme used in the 
CCARH database for essential musical pitch and duration 
information is just one of an open-ended set&mdash;some other members 
of which I mention below&mdash;that may be augmented by user-defined 
schemes for specific research tasks. Second, there is the set 
of commands, the Humdrum Toolkit, devised to manipulate files 
that conform to the Humdrum syntax in the name of machine-aided 
research in music. The emphasis here should be on &ldquo;aided&rdquo;: 
Humdrum possesses no higher-level analytical faculties per se. 
Rather, its power derives from the flexibility of its kit of elemental 
commands, which the user must learn to use in combination to exploit 
fully the system&rsquo;s potential.

<p style="text-align: center"><b>3. Humdrum Representations</b></p>

<p>

[3.1] Before discussing the ways in which the 
Toolkit can be used 
it will be helpful to inspect the conventions of one particular 
Humdrum representation, by means of a musical fragment. <b>Example 1</b> (below) contains the first two phrases of the Bach chorale &ldquo;Nun 
danket alle Gott&rdquo; in Humdrum&rsquo;s core pitch/duration representation 
scheme, <b>**kern</b>.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> In this 
example, the first three lines, each 
tagged by a triple exclamation mark, are reference records, each 
of whose meaning should be readily apparent. Humdrum specifies 
over 80 types of reference records for electronic scores, 
providing for information as diverse as the catalogue number, 
name of the dedicatee, manuscript location or translated title 
in over forty languages.<p>

<p>

[3.2] A Humdrum file is comprised of a series of <i>records</i>, each 
taking up one line. The four columns that follow the reference 
records are termed <i>spines</i>; they are separated by tab 
characters. Events in the same data record occur 
simultaneously, while events in the same spine but in distinct 
data records occur sequentially. The heading <b>**kern</b>, which is 
the <i>exclusive interpretation</i> of each spine here, signifies 
that the information within concerns pitch and duration. A file 
may contain any number of spines with various exclusive 
representations; in this example each spine represents one voice 
of a four-part chorale. The fifth data record of Example 1 
contains a <i>tandem interpretation</i> for each spine which denotes 
the key of the excerpt; other tandem interpretations within 
<b>**kern</b> contain information about meter signature, tempo, 
instrument etc. <p>

[3.3] A <b>**kern</b> representation may be thought of as a rotation, 
90-clockwise, of the musical score. Thus the leftmost spine 
corresponds to the lowest voice, and time runs down the page 
instead of left to right. Additional spines, possibly running 
concurrently with <b>**kern</b>, could contain either fairly 
straightforward things, such as vocal text (<b>**text 
representation</b>) or a Roman-numeral harmonic analysis (<b>**harm 
representation</b>), or relatively abstruse information such as 
cochlear coordinates (<b>**cocho</b>), sensory dissonance 
(<b>**diss</b>) or 
acoustic spectral data (<b>**spect</b>). Some of these other 
representations can be generated as output by commands operating 
on a <b>**kern</b> spine or set of spines. For example, the pcset 
command would automatically append to the chorale in example 1 a 
<b>**pcset </b>spine that labeled each simultaneity by its Fortean 
set-class name, prime-form or interval vector. The data for a 
<b>**harm</b> spine, on the other hand, must be entered manually (until 
a dependable machine algorithm for harmonic analysis is 
developed).
<p>
[3.4] Each encoded note in example 1 has at least two parts, 
corresponding respectively to the note&rsquo;s duration and pitch: an 
integer, and one or more upper- or lower-case letters. The 
integer represents duration via the reciprocal of the 
North-American note-value; for example, a quarter-note by &ldquo;4&rdquo; 
and a sixteenth-note by &ldquo;16.&rdquo; A breve (length of two 
whole-notes) takes the special value 0. Eighth-note triplets 
would each be allotted the integer 12&mdash;since they each span a 
third of a quarter-note, logically they are twelfth-notes. A 
note participating in a septuplet in the time of a dotted 
quarter-note would receive the value 28 (one seventh of a 
quarter-note, or a 28th-note) augmented by a dot; a further 
subdivision of this note into three parts would yield a dotted 
84th-note (!). This convention may at first appear opaque, but 
manages succinctly and consistently to express <i>almost</i> all 
durations. Exceptions that spring to mind include the 
admittedly obscure odd subdivisions of a breve, such as 
whole-note triplets (three to a breve), and such Ferneyhoughian 
atrocities as &ldquo;four in the time of three notes of a quintuplet,&rdquo; 
which require the use of superfluous ties and/or dots.<p>

[3.5] The lower- or upper-case letters denote the pitch-class and 
octave of a note; chromatic alterations are of course also 
provided for, as are a large number of articulation markings 
(such as the tie in the alto part of Example 1, shown by the square 
brackets), ornaments, editorialisms, and stem and beam 
indicators. It is important to note that each of the components 
of a note&rsquo;s representation is optional: a file containing 
durations only could be compiled were one&rsquo;s object to 
investigate solely the rhythmic character of a set of melodies. 
Rests are indicated by combining a reciprocal duration with the 
letter &ldquo;r&rdquo;; the frequent period characters are merely place 
markers, &ldquo;null tokens&rdquo; in a data record with activity in another 
spine. Barlines appear as records with a leading 
equals sign; 
an elaborate system of visual correspondences distinguishes 
between various forms of double barlines and/or repeat signs. 
Dynamics are conspicuously absent in <b>**kern</b>, and indeed do not 
appear in any of the pre-defined representation schemes 
documented in the manual<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>&mdash;should 
they be required for a 
specific task the researcher may invent his or her own scheme. 
Guidelines for this are given in a chapter of the reference 
manual.<p>

[3.6] As may be surmised, thoroughly encoding a piece of music can 
be a fairly laborious process. Unless electronic editions of 
the works under investigation happen to be available, either 
commercially or in the public domain, this is likely to be the 
biggest impediment to a researcher&rsquo;s making use of Humdrum. 
While there are functions designed for capturing data from a 
MIDI controller (encode and record), it may often be simpler to 
enter <b>**kern</b> data manually once one is familiar with the 
encoding format&mdash;especially when reduced information suffices 
for the task at hand. With the advent of a reliable Optical 
Music Recognition system, under development at McGill University 
and elsewhere, a program could certainly be written to scan a 
monophonic score directly into a Humdrum file. But with more 
complex input such as found in, say, a late Romantic piano work, 
it will be some time before a computer can correctly parse the 
music into meaningful strands suitable for Humdrum spines&mdash;an 
inner part crossing between staves is apt to cause confusion 
even in music students, let alone in a segmentation program. 
Automated translation of a standard MIDI file into a Humdrum 
format offers the same problems (although the opposite 
conversion, from any one of several Humdrum formats to a 
standard MIDI file, is possible and indeed implemented in the 
tool kit).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup><p>

[3.7] While here is not the place for a detailed examination of 
all the various pre-defined Humdrum formats, a couple more will 
serve as additional examples to <b>**kern</b>. The tablature 
representation for fretted instruments, <b>**fret</b>, is particularly 
well developed, and can accommodate non-standard and non-Western 
instruments. The tuning of each string and the exact position 
of each fret are specified in tandem interpretations, and 
detailed information is encoded in each data record about which 
strings are plucked, how they are plucked, and at which fret. 
The <b>**IPA</b> scheme phonetically represents vocal texts via an 
ASCII alphabet, and includes stress and intonation information. 
The &ldquo;formant&rdquo; command can be used to generate a spine with the two 
strongest formant frequencies of each vowel encoded in the <b>**IPA</b> 
representation.

[4.1] The &ldquo;active&rdquo; component of Humdrum, as compared to the 
&ldquo;passive&rdquo; syntax and representation schemes, is the kit of tools 
for manipulating data files that conform to the Humdrum syntax. 
Once the Toolkit is installed, commands are invoked via a 
standard UNIX terminal, and the bulk of a researcher&rsquo;s work will 
probably rely on ordinary UNIX commands such as &ldquo;grep&rdquo; or &ldquo;sort.&rdquo; 
A modicum of familiarity with this operating system is required 
for the aspiring Humdrummer to embark on a research project, and 
the more at ease he or she is in a UNIX environment the sooner 
Humdrum will be mastered. There are roughly a 
dozen basic UNIX 
commands that a user should be able to negotiate, but no 
introduction to this basic knowledge within the current Humdrum 
documentation.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p>

[4.2] A glance at the names of most Humdrum commands reveals very 
little about their purpose: only a small minority of them, such 
as &ldquo;tran&rdquo; (transpose), &ldquo;reihe&rdquo; (give variant row form), &ldquo;iv&rdquo; 
(determine interval vectors) and &ldquo;freq&rdquo; (return frequency in Hz), 
have any obvious musical significance. And, as noted in the 
reference manual, these tend to be the least useful commands, 
since they are so specialized. The nature of many 
of the basic 
commands taken individually is quite abstract. To give an idea 
of their scope in combination, as well as of the working 
environment of Humdrum, here follows a modest sample problem we 
might wish to answer.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>5. Sample Problem</b></p>

<p>

[5.1] <i>In what proportion are leading-tones in Bach chorale 
melodies approached from beneath, and in what proportion from 
above?</i>
If we are unaided by a computer, the question will pose no 
special problem as long as we restrict the number of chorales we 
wish to consider: for some purposes a few will suffice and the 
appropriate notes can easily be counted by hand. But should we 
wish to consider a large number of chorales, our task will be 
considerably easier&mdash;and will provide more reliable answers&mdash;if 
we let the computer do the counting.  Let us work 
through the 
steps involved, assuming the existence of a file containing 
encoded versions of several Bach chorales.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> First, we are 
interested only in the melody, which is in the soprano part, or 
the fourth spine of the file. For this we may use the Humdrum 
command &ldquo;extract,&rdquo; which selects certain data from a file. The 
full command would be <p><pre>

extract -p 4 chorales &gt; temp1</pre><p>

where the &ldquo;-p 4&rdquo; indicates the fourth spine, and &ldquo;temp1&rdquo; is the 
name of the temporary file we are creating for the extracted 
spine.<p>

[5.2] The original file represents notes by their pitch. We need 
scale-degree information instead, in order to locate 
leading-tones. The command &ldquo;deg&rdquo; will convert a file of <b>**kern</b> 
data records into a file of <b>**deg</b> records, where each note 
appears as a number from 1 to 7, representing its scale degree. 
The calculation is relative to the current key, as specified in 
<i>key</i> tandem interpretation records in the file. We also require 
contour information; happily the <b>**deg</b> representation includes a 
direction indicator: the lower-case letter v signifies &ldquo;lower 
than previous note&rdquo; and the caret ^ signifies &ldquo;higher than 
previous note.&rdquo; The next step in our sample problem is thus:
<p><pre>
deg -x temp1 &gt; temp2 
</pre><p>
where the &ldquo;-x&rdquo; removes certain extraneous data. The new file, 
temp2, will begin something like this:<p><pre>

!!!COM: Bach, Johann Sebastian
!!!XEN: J. S. Bach Chorale Harmonizations
!!!OTL: Ermuntre dich, mein schwacher Geist
!!!ONM: No. 9
!!!SCT: BWV 454
**deg
! soprano
*M4/4
*G:
1
. 

=1
1
. 

^2

..[etc.]
</pre><p>

[5.3] This is quite a messy file, for it includes comments 
(records with leading exclamation marks), null tokens (records 
containing only the period punctuation sign) and bar-lines 
(records with leading equals signs). We could invoke the 
Humdrum &ldquo;rid&rdquo; command to get &ldquo;rid&rdquo; of the items superfluous to our 
inquiry, but it is not strictly necessary. For our purposes the 
only records that matter are those which contain the digit 7, 
for the leading-tone, and start with an up or down sign (^ or 
v). We can use the UNIX command &ldquo;grep&rdquo; (Get Regular ExPression) 
to comb the file under scrutiny for a target string, and output 
only those lines containing at least one occurrence of the 
string. The target-string syntax will no doubt be obscure to 
those unfamiliar with UNIX regular expressions; leaving that 
aside for now, the following command (working on the file 
previously generated):<p><pre>

grep ^[v^]7 temp2 &gt; temp3


will yield the following file, called temp3: 

^7
v7
v7
^7
v7-

..[etc.]
</pre><p>

[5.4] Notice that a few records with a minus sign 
appear in this 
file. These represent lowered seventh scale-degrees such as may 
occur in a tonicization of IV, or in the mediant area of a 
minor-key chorale.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> To ignore these 
records we can make use 
of grep&rsquo;s -v option, which removes any lines containing the 
target string and returns only those lines without it:<p><pre>

grep -v [-] temp3 &gt; temp4
</pre><p>

[5.5] The original file has been whittled down to 
a series of 
records that contain exclusively unlowered leading-tones along 
with directional information. The final step will be to compare 
the frequency of occurrence of ^7 to that of v7. This requires 
the standard UNIX compound command sort | uniq -c | sort, which 
removes all duplicate lines from a file, recording the number of 
occurrences of each, and returns the contents in increasing 
order of frequency.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> The last step 
in our problem, then, is: <p><pre> 

sort temp4 | uniq -c | sort
</pre>
<p>

[5.6] The sequence of commands given above generated a chain of 
intermediate, &ldquo;junk&rdquo; files&mdash;Humdrum and UNIX commands generally 
create new files, leaving those they worked on intact. Instead 
the whole process, once designed and tested on a shorter file, 
could be amalgamated in a &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; of commands, each passing 
its result to the next through the UNIX &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; (typed as |):<p><pre>

extract -p 4 chorales | deg -x | grep ^[v^]7 | grep -v [-] | 
sort | uniq -c | sort 
</pre><p>
The final output will look something like this:<p><pre>

15 ^7
22 v7
</pre><p>
indicating that, within the sample of sixteen chorales, Bach 
approached the leading tone from above roughly 50% 
more often than from below.<p>

[5.7] As we can gather from the above, the 
difficulty in 
implementing the machine-aided solution does not lie in 
understanding the functioning of the individual commands, but in 
devising an appropriate way to combine them. The advantages of 
a machine-aided solution to this problem are threefold. First, 
extremely large amounts of music could be processed with no 
extra work on the part of the researcher, and the task would 
remain tractable within a reasonable length of time.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
Secondly, we obtain a concrete and objective result, 
reproducible by other workers with access to the same data. And 
thirdly, if we decide afterwards that we wish to vary the 
question by, say, discounting leading tones approached by leap 
instead of step, we would not have to return to the scores from 
scratch, but simply add a couple of steps to our pipeline of 
commands. 


<p style="text-align: center"><b>6. The Toolkit</b></p>

<p>
[6.1] The manual divides the Toolkit into the categories of 
specialized and basic tools. Specialized tools work only on a 
particular subset of exclusive representations. Two that crop 
up frequently in standard analytical applications derive 
harmonic and melodic intervals from <b>**kern</b>-type spines; these 
are respectively invoked by &ldquo;hint&rdquo; and &ldquo;mint.&rdquo; Alternative 
representations of pitch are generated from a <b>**kern</b> spine by 
the commands &ldquo;cents&rdquo; (distance in hundredths of a semitone from a 
reference point), &ldquo;freq&rdquo; (frequency in Hz), &ldquo;semits&rdquo; (semitones away 
from a reference point), and several others, which could all be 
useful depending on the nature of one&rsquo;s research. (I personally 
can&rsquo;t imagine an application for the <b>**solfg</b> representation, 
which encodes pitch as French solfege syllables, but should 
anyone dream one up Humdrum is prepared.) There are several 
advanced commands that calculate numerical results from spines 
already present, such as &ldquo;spect,&rdquo; which assembles sonorities&rsquo; 
spectral content for acoustical tasks, &ldquo;synco,&rdquo; which gives a 
measure of metric syncopation for each note, and &ldquo;diss,&rdquo; which 
implements the Kameoka/Kuriyagawa measure of dissonance. The 
algorithms that perform the calculations are well documented, 
where applicable. <p>

[6.2] The &ldquo;perform&rdquo; command plays back the 
contents of a Humdrum 
MIDI file, converted from a <b>**kern </b>file by the midi command (and 
further convertible to a standard MIDI file by the smf command, 
for exporting to a sequencer or other external application 
program).<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Play-back is via an 
external MIDI synthesizer and 
control card (not included!), and allows the user to 
proof-listen interactively, changing the tempo, repeating 
sections and skipping forwards or backwards to the desired bar 
number. An extremely promising feature from a pedagogical point 
of view is that &ldquo;perform&rdquo; relays comments encoded alongside the 
music onto the screen. Thus the encoding of a sonata could 
include labels for the various formal sections or particular 
harmonic devices, which would appear on the screen at the 
appropriate moment during playback. Another application would 
be to use the &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; command to locate tone rows in a 
twelve-tone piece and tag them with a comment, letting &ldquo;perform&rdquo; 
skip straight to each occurrence of the row and provide 
on-screen commentary about the row-form.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup><p>


[6.3] Basic tools, contrary to specialized tools, do their work 
on any representation scheme. Many of them combine or 
dissociate spines, files or parts of files as intermediate steps 
in a problem&rsquo;s solution; these include &ldquo;assemble,&rdquo; &ldquo;extract,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;rend,&rdquo; &ldquo;yank,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cleave&rdquo; (this last command is used in the 
older sense, of &ldquo;join&rdquo;, as in &ldquo;a man shall cleave unto his wife,&rdquo; 
rather than its opposite, as in &ldquo;rock of ages, cleft for me&rdquo;). 
There are also several tools useful for statistical and 
information-theoretical measures; these include &ldquo;correl,&rdquo; which 
provides a coefficient of correlation between the numeric data 
in two spines, &ldquo;simil,&rdquo; which measures the similarity between two 
spines based on typographical &ldquo;edit distance,&rdquo; &ldquo;infot,&rdquo; which 
describes the flow of information, and &ldquo;scramble&rdquo; which randomizes 
data records for control purposes. <p>

[6.4] Two very powerful basic tools deserve special mention: &ldquo;patt&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;pattern,&rdquo; which differ only slightly in their functioning. 
Each allows the user to define a pattern in a template that 
should match one or a sequence of data records in the file, not 
necessarily contiguous. Humdrum will proceed exhaustively to 
locate patterns in the encoded selection that match the 
template. Patterns can be horizontal (simultaneous), vertical 
(sequential within one spine), or even diagonal (useful for 
identifying <i>Klangfarbenmelodie</i> or other &ldquo;threaded&rdquo; patterns), 
and can be defined as explicitly or as &ldquo;fuzzily&rdquo; as is needed. 
The researcher can use other representations than <b>**kern</b> in 
conjunction with these tools&mdash;for example to discover idiomatic 
fingering patterns from a <b>**fret</b>representation, or particular 
harmonic progressions from a <b>**harm </b>representation. There is a 
considerable art involved in correctly defining the target 
template; readers familiar with UNIX regular expression syntax, 
crucial here in the creation of a template, will appreciate the 
niceties involved in fine-tuning an expression that is to be 
sought. The manual justly includes an tutorial in 
regular-expression syntax, and is at its best in this 
exceedingly clear section dealing with what in other hands could 
easily have appeared especially cryptic. Humdrum also provides 
for interactive checking of a regular expression against a 
user-definable test file, via the command &ldquo;regexp.&rdquo;<p>

[6.5] The demonstration program bundled with the Toolkit solves 
ten problems on screen, explaining each step as it is 
implemented. To work through the problems myself I found I had 
to refer to the shell scripts containing the commands that 
actually perform the manipulations, rather than the onscreen 
versions, which are somewhat simplified. Half of the sample 
problems incorporate audio illustrations; they include locating 
all occurrences of &ldquo;B-A-C-H&rdquo; in a Brandenburg Concerto and a 
comparison of syncopation in George Gershwin and Stephen Foster. 
The reference manual gives several other examples of questions 
that Humdrum could be used to answer; they include: Are 
crescendos in Wagner more strongly associated with rising pitch 
than is the case with other composers? In Bartok, are 
dissonances more common in strong metric positions than in weak 
metric positions? In Urdu folk songs, how common is the 
so-called &ldquo;melodic arch&rdquo;&mdash;where phrases tend to ascend and then 
descend in pitch? While the demonstration 
software provides 
some help in appreciating how problems can be solved using 
connected Humdrum tools, and while annotated solutions to sample 
problems do not belong, strictly speaking, in a reference work, 
novice users may feel they need more hints than they can glean 
from individual command specifications as to how these questions 
might be answered.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup><p>

[6.6] The Toolkit and representation schemes are not intended to 
meet the requirements of a researcher&rsquo;s every contingency, nor 
could they be. Creating &ldquo;home-made&rdquo; task-specific 
representations is a simple job, given some discussion in the 
manual. The creation of new commands, on the other hand, is 
likely to remain the domain of those already familiar with a 
programming language. A skeleton program to aid in software 
development is provided, written in the AWK programming language 
and incorporating several useful functions.


<p style="text-align: center"><b>7. Reference Manual</b></p>

<p>
[7] Humdrum&rsquo;s compendious reference manual is a model of 
clarity, completeness and logical design, running to 550 pages 
including a substantial index of some 2700 terms. The &ldquo;General 
Introduction&rdquo; is especially well written, and admirable in its 
level-headed and patient presentation of the elements of 
Humdrum&mdash;having tried myself I realize how difficult it is to 
explain clearly what Humdrum actually is and does. Each command 
and representation scheme is fully documented, in a consistent 
style that tends to err on the side of redundancy rather than 
attempt to be overly concise. Whereas typos and omissions tend 
to creep in quite easily in reference works, here there are very 
few. The number of theoretically possible fingerings for a 
piano work is given as ten times the number of key presses 
involved, instead of the number of key presses raised to the 
tenth power (page 514); two typographical strings with no symbols 
in common are said to exhibit minimum edit-distance, instead of 
maximum edit-distance (page 420); several commands (specc, spect, 
formant and diss) are mentioned in passing but not given proper 
documentation (though the representations they produce are); it 
is suggested that a dominant seventh chord on the supertonic 
degree be labelled V7/ii (page 86); and the two accounts of the 
signifier for doubly-lowered notes in the <b>**deg</b> representation 
are inconsistent (pages 59, 264). 



<p style="text-align: center"><b>8. Humdrum Now and in the Future</b></p>

<p>
[8.1] The Toolkit can currently be downloaded from the server at 
the University of Waterloo. The FTP site is 
<archive.uwaterloo.ca>, and Humdrum resides in the directory 
called /uw-data. Although the software is free, users must 
license their copy after ten days by sending their vital 
statistics to David Huron at Waterloo; this information is used 
to demonstrate to granting agencies that the software is being 
used. It runs in UNIX, DOS, Windows95 or OS/2 environments, but 
the last three require the presence of some UNIX utilities&mdash;the 
AWK language and a shell command interpreter&mdash;before Humdrum can 
be installed. On UNIX machines the perform, encode and record 
functions are not implemented as of yet, and several other 
commands must be compiled locally before they can run&mdash;I had 
difficulty getting the simil command to compile, and eventually 
gave up. All instructions are given very clearly in the 
Installation Guide, which is included with the software in 
PostScript format, as is the Reference Manual. A very clear FAQ 
(Frequently Asked Questions) file is included with the release, 
too; Huron recommends that potential users read this document 
carefully before deciding to download the Toolkit. It can be 
viewed on a World Wide Web site at: <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/dmmc/Music/Humdrum">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/dmmc/Music/Humdrum</a>
<p>

[8.2] Scores that accompany the current release of Humdrum 
include a selection of sixteen Bach chorales, in both <b>**kern </b>and 
<b>**harm</b> representations; all 48 fugues from the Well-Tempered 
Clavier; vocal melodies from Schubert Lieder and a collection of 
Scottish and English folk tunes. A <b>**kern</b> thematic database of 
some ten thousand well-known classical themes (melody only) is 
expected to be accessible via the World Wide Web early in the 
new year, and is being considered for release as part of the 
Humdrum Toolkit in the near future. Such thematic catalogues 
exist in books already, but the flexibility of searching that 
Humdrum offers far surpasses that possible in the printed 
medium. For instance, one could very quickly find all tunes in 
the database whose first four notes have increasing durations; 
or whose range is exactly a minor sixth; or which are in Eb 
minor and triple metre. This could be very useful in a music 
library, among other contexts. A user might wish to find the 
source of a tune that started with, say, three notes descending 
stepwise, followed by upwards motion for one note then downwards 
notion for one note, the last of these five notes being longer 
than the others. Once the appropriate search string was 
defined, Humdrum could find any matches, and, if there are more 
than one, provide a MIDI performance of each of the candidates. 
Or rather than define the target string explicitly, the user 
could play his or her best approximation to the tune on a MIDI 
controller; Humdrum would find the closest matches in the 
database and give the numerical measure of correlation to what 
was played for each match.<p>

[8.3] Huron is nearing completion of a Users&rsquo; 
Guide to Humdrum 
that &ldquo;takes novice users by the hand, and teaches both Humdrum 
and the pertinent Unix utilities.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Many sample problems 
will be given annotated solutions, filling a gap in Humdrum 
documentation as it currently stands. To master 
the system will 
still require hard work, but the frustration of learning to 
navigate the unfamiliar environment of UNIX will hopefully be 
lessened. An alternative way of learning Humdrum is through a 
seminar: Professor Huron taught a two-week summer course on the 
use of the Toolkit at Stanford this year,<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> and at McGill the 
previous summer.<p>


[8.4] All this proselytizing may still fail to 
convince, given 
the reluctance and inertia many of us are likely to experience 
when faced with as new and as vast a resource as Humdrum. So, 
software developers have turned their attention to Humdrum-based 
graphic user interfaces, which may well prove more appetizing to 
those who feel claustrophobic when restricted to a bare UNIX 
shell. Two third-party graphic interfaces to 
Humdrum have been 
developed, in Ireland and in Germany.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> At the time of writing 
I have been unable to inspect them, though Andreas Kornstaedt&rsquo;s 
is apparently described in a recent publication.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Also in 
the works is a third-party translator from Humdrum to a 
notation-based program, so that Humdrum files can be viewed as 
scores or printed in traditional notation.<p>

[8.5] Humdrum provides concrete answers to well-posed questions. 
Surprising or counterintuitive answers could be genuine, or they 
could be the result of a malformed question or incorrect 
implementation of Humdrum commands. It thus becomes important, 
when using machine-aided methods to prove or disprove a 
hypothesis, to document one&rsquo;s methods. Full documentation of 
Humdrum processes could quickly become distracting, tedious, or 
unfeasible in a printed article where the ends, and not the 
means, constitute the main point. It would however be a simple 
matter to place the relevant Humdrum scripts and encoded scores 
on an internet site, referenced by the article, and available to 
interested parties for retrieval.


<p style="text-align: center"><b>9. Conclusions</b></p>

<p>
[9.1] Appreciation of the full potential of Humdrum is definitely 
a hands-on experience. In the words of David Huron, from the 
reference manual:<p>

<blockquote>[a]ny set of tools requires the development of a concomitant 
expertise, and the Humdrum Toolkit is no exception. It is my 
hope that the investment of time required to learn how to use 
Humdrum will be more than offset by the subsequent scholarly 
gains.</blockquote> <p>

Huron has certainly proved the last portion of 
this excerpt 
through his own research, much of which has relied on Humdrum. 
His work in music perception accounts for the inclusion in the 
Toolkit of some specialized tools relevant to that area&mdash;in fact 
Humdrum users have so far tended to work in music perception or 
ethnomusicology, while theorists and historical musicologists 
have been slow to recognize the system&rsquo;s potential. Huron 
offers the following sampling of projects he is aware of that 
relied on Humdrum:<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> a study of 
canonic compositional rules by 
Zarlino, a study of Korean court music, a study of text/melody 
relationships in Gregorian chant, a study of idiomaticism in 
trumpet works, testing of Narmour&rsquo;s model of melodic structure, 
a study of musical texture, of Haydn string quartets, of 
phrasing and dynamics in piano works, and in perceptual 
experiments, etc.<p>

[9.2] Humdrum or other systems like it offer the wherewithal for 
a brand new paradigm for music research. The tedium of 
collating hard evidence for one&rsquo;s theories can be greatly 
alleviated by automation, and the more music examined the 
greater the rigor of proof for one&rsquo;s hypotheses. However the 
unfortunate possibility is that many of today&rsquo;s musicologists 
and theorists who could benefit from a little machine-aided 
insight are likely to be put off by Humdrum&rsquo;s completely 
text-based interface. Although in the final analysis UNIX-style 
commands are surely more flexible and efficient than a 
&ldquo;user-friendly,&rdquo; graphic interface, they can appear daunting to 
non-programmers, many of whom stand to be deterred from making 
use of an otherwise valuable tool. Whether or not music 
theorists will choose to augment their invaluable musical 
intuition with equally invaluable empirically verified results, 
based on maximum amounts of relevant data, will be a most 
important factor in the evolution of our discipline.</p>

describes a translator program from the widely used notation 
program SCORE to a Humdrum format. Should the translation
