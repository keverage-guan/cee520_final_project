<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In light of the number of articles on 
transformational harmony appearing recently in scholarly journals, one might 
expect a book of this title to be a full-blown study in what has come to be 
called &ldquo;neo-Riemannian&rdquo; theory. Instead, however, it is a view of harmony based 
on a transformational system of the author&rsquo;s own invention. And while he 
acknowledges some indebtedness to the work of other theorists, David Kopp&rsquo;s 
specific goal is to account for and incorporate chromatic mediant relations 
within a functional system that is applicable to nineteenth-century harmonic 
practice. His notion of &ldquo;functional&rdquo; does not rely on traditional categories of 
tonic, dominant and subdominant chords and their syntactic roles within harmonic 
progressions; nor does he focus on diatonic scale degrees and the harmonies 
built on them, as in Roman-numeral analysis. Rather, Kopp defines functions as 
transformations between chords sharing one or more common tones. In these 
respects, his work is distinctive.</p>
<p align="left">[2] In the book&rsquo;s first chapter, which follows a thoughtful 
forward by Ian Bent, Kopp identifies the common-tone relationships that comprise 
his transformational system and examines in particular the role of chromatic 
mediants. Unlike definitions in other sources, which often include third-related 
triads that share no pitch classes (e.g., C major and E flat minor), Kopp 
appropriately limits his &ldquo;chromatic mediant&rdquo; designation to those with one 
common tone. The second chapter illustrates and discusses the use of chromatic 
mediants in three pieces by Schubert, and is the first of several such 
presentations that contribute to the book&rsquo;s cogency by presenting the author&rsquo;s 
views in relevant musical contexts.</p>

<p align="left">[3] The next four chapters examine the treatment of third 
relations by theorists from Rameau through the twentieth century, with the 
heaviest emphasis on the work of Hugo Riemann. Although this material is 
impressive in scope as well as in attention to detail, it also seems a largely 
unnecessary and overly long digression from the author&rsquo;s primary objective. This 
foray into the often-quirky quagmire of the history of theory makes up nearly 
forty percent of the book and forms a kind of barrier between the presentation 
of ideas in the opening chapters and their subsequent development. Here, most 
readers would likely prefer one or two chapters that focus more specifically on 
ways in which contemporary theoretical approaches (i.e., functional, 
Schenkerian, and neo-Riemannian) deal with chromatic mediants, and that point to 
the need for a more musically enlightened alternative.</p>

<p align="left">[4] In Chapter 7, Kopp returns to his own ideas of harmonic 
progression defined as triadic transformations, and presents a system based on 
the common-tone relationships identified in Chapter 1. 
<b>Table 1</b> lists these 
thirteen transformations, which are characterized according to root movement and 
whether triad quality (i.e., major or minor mode) is retained or changed. 
Chapter 8 explores, through the use of brief examples from the 
nineteenth-century repertoire, occurrences of these transformations as harmonic 
mechanisms and examines their roles in various musical situations. This chapter 
uses score notation with transformations labeled, as well as network diagrams, 
to address in detail what Kopp sees as the &ldquo;functional&rdquo; nature of these 
progressions. The processes defined here serve the same general purpose as 
functional designations in traditional, diatonically oriented approaches to 
harmonic syntax in that they attempt to convey information about the relatedness 
of chords and the musical effect of different types of progressions. The final 
chapter presents five analyses that apply the transformational system and 
mechanisms explored in Chapters 7 and 8 to complete pieces. Because Chapters 7&ndash;9 
carry the essential content of the study, I will consider them more carefully 
here.</p>
<p align="left">[5] Readers familiar with transformational theory will recognize 
some important similarities and differences between Kopp&rsquo;s transformations and 
those of other theorists inspired by Riemann&rsquo;s prevenient efforts, notably David 
Lewin, Brian Hyer, and Richard Cohn. (Since the relevant studies are well 
documented by Kopp, I will omit specific citations here.) The <b>P</b> 
transformation is common to all these systems. <b>S</b> is from Lewin. The <b>R</b> 
transformation is the same as Riemann&rsquo;s <b>L</b> (<i>Leittonwechsel</i>), which 
is retained by Cohn and other neo-Riemannian theorists, whereas Riemann&rsquo;s <b>R</b> 
(Relative) becomes a lower-case <b>r</b> in Kopp&rsquo;s system. <b>D</b> is a 
Riemannian function discussed also by Hyer, but eschewed by Cohn because it can 
be expressed as a compound of what he considers to be more basic functions, <b>R</b> 
plus <b>L</b>. These differences point up the most distinctive feature of Kopp&rsquo;s 
system, which is its consistent expression of connections between chords sharing 
at least one common tone as unary transformations. Neo-Riemannian theory, by 
contrast, favors a smaller number of transformation types, and uses compound 
expressions more freely. </p>
<p align="left">[6] The primacy of common-tone connections in Kopp&rsquo;s system is 
tied to his ideas about chord functions, in particular with regard to the role 
of chromatic mediants (<b>M</b> and <b>m</b>). In the more traditional view of 
harmonic function, a direct chromatic-mediant juxtaposition is normally regarded 
as a non-functional, or tonally disruptive, event. In Schenkerian theory, such 
progressions must be absorbed into a larger harmonic motion, usually toward the 
dominant, and the chromatic mediant chord, instead of being understood as a 
harmony in its own right, is explained as an inflection of some diatonic 
harmony. And as important as chromatic mediant relationships are in 
neo-Riemannian theory, here too they lack independent standing in that they are 
interpreted, like <b>D</b>, as compound transformations (<b>PL</b> or <b>RP</b> 
for roots descending a major or minor third, respectively). The principal 
advantage of Kopp&rsquo;s approach, then, is the treatment of these characteristic 
nineteenth-century harmonic events as completely intelligible and coherent tonal 
relationships that deserve to be on equal footing with other common-tone 
progressions, diatonic or chromatic, such as <b>D</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>R</b> and <b>
r</b>. Many of the musical examples discussed in Chapter 8 make a strong and 
convincing case for this argument; thus for anyone sensitive to the special role 
of chromatic mediant progressions in this repertoire, Kopp&rsquo;s ideas are likely to 
have considerable intuitive appeal.</p>

<p align="left">[7] As successful as Kopp is in legitimizing chromatic mediants 
as tonally functional entities, his transformational system nevertheless fails 
to address a number of issues. If in fact he proposes that common-tone functions 
represent a more-or-less self-sufficient means for conducting meaningful 
harmonic analysis, there are some nagging questions that need answers. Foremost 
among the issues that confront all transformational harmonic theory is the 
choice of objects, or chord types, that make up the system. Kopp&rsquo;s system is 
based on consonant (major and minor) triads. (This was also the case in 
neo-Riemannian theory at first, but more recent studies have begun to 
concentrate on seventh chords as well.) It cannot account for diminished or 
augmented triads, despite the larger role these sonorities assume in 
nineteenth-century music. Because Kopp treats sevenths as appendages to triads, 
seventh chords have no independent standing, and only those containing a 
consonant triad (especially the dominant seventh) are included. The system does 
not deal with diminished sevenths at all, and one is left to wonder whether, for 
example, a half-diminished seventh might be considered as a minor triad with a 
Rameau-esque &ldquo;subposed&rdquo; root. There are not compelling musical reasons why 
certain chords have a place in the system, whereas chords of similar 
construction or usage do not. The German augmented sixth, for instance, is in, 
because it has the same pitch-class content as a dominant seventh, but the 
French sixth is out. The dominant seventh with raised fifth is also out, even 
though its resolution is typically similar to that of the dominant seventh. 
Consider especially the relationship between the two situations given in 
<b>Example 1</b>, the so-called &ldquo;common-tone augmented sixth&rdquo; and &ldquo;common-tone diminished 
seventh.&rdquo; In terms of voice leading, they represent only slightly different 
versions of the same phenomenon; but again, only the former one has a place in 
Kopp&rsquo;s chromatic system, and indeed figures prominently in his analysis of 
Wolf&rsquo;s <i>In der Fr&uuml;he</i>, as the progression that connects the two contrasting 
halves of the song.</p>
<p align="left">[8] Another set of issues pertains to the application of the 
system in an analytic method that identifies transformations both in direct 
successions and in long-range harmonic relationships. Kopp&rsquo;s analyses sometimes 
prioritize chord-to-chord movement, and at other times focus on larger-scale 
harmonic designs. In the latter case, his analysis of Chopin&rsquo;s Mazurka, Op. 56 
No. 1 (pages 235&ndash;40) is extraordinary in its revelation of an overall scheme in 
which a number of distantly-related tonalities are organized around the tonic as 
a symmetrical network of transformations. It is unlikely that any other approach 
could express this design more efficiently. At other times (e.g., the analysis 
of Liszt&rsquo;s Consolation No. 3, pages 240&ndash;6), Kopp considers different views of 
harmonic structure based on different chord groupings. His multi-level thinking 
imparts analytical flexibility, but since there are no rules within the model 
itself that help to determine which relationships hold greater import or 
primacy, he is left to justify his choices somewhat informally, in terms of 
musical context. </p>
<p align="left">[9] Kopp&rsquo;s inherently musical perspective and intimate knowledge of the 
repertoire contribute as much to the success of the analyses as his 
transformational system, suggesting that the system is perhaps of greatest 
benefit when it can be incorporated into a multi-faceted view of musical 
structure. Wherever the analyses fall short, it is attributable to the fact that 
a hegemonistic harmonic orientation drives the analysis, consigning factors like 
melody and voice leading to a subsidiary role. As an illustration, consider 
Schubert&rsquo;s <i>Die junge Nonne,</i> which is the final work examined in Chapter 9 (pages 254&ndash;63). The harmonic design of this song is remarkable in several respects, and 
Kopp&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;notions of mediant function help to clarify the nature of 
harmony and musical meaning&rdquo; (page 254) is correct as far as it goes. I propose, 
however, that in this work harmony and melody are <i>equal</i> partners in the musical 
structure and in the formation of relationships between music and text.</p>
<p align="left">[10] Kopp divides the song into an introduction (mm. 1-8) and four stanzas (measures 9&ndash;34, 34&ndash;50, 51&ndash;61, and 62&ndash;92). Although he does not give an overview of the 
text (by Craigher), it would be helpful to the discussion. The young nun begins 
by describing a storm raging outside her window in the first stanza; then in 
stanza two she compares the storm to her life at an earlier time. In the third 
stanza she speaks of her recently acquired peace and spiritual freedom. The 
climax comes at the beginning of stanza four, where she calls for Christ to come 
and &ldquo;take his bride.&rdquo; The tension abates thereafter, and the song concludes with 
a serene &ldquo;Alleluja&rdquo; passage. </p>
<p align="left">[11] In Schubert&rsquo;s setting, the first two stanzas are similar, beginning and 
ending in F minor. The last two are in F major, reflecting the text&rsquo;s change of 
mood. More striking harmonic relationships exist within the stanzas, especially 
in the tonal scheme. The first two stanzas move from F minor to F sharp minor 
before returning to the home key; the third stanza introduces some direct 
chromatic mediant progressions (C7 to A and A to F7), but the next strong 
tonicization is D flat major at the beginning of stanza four. Kopp&rsquo;s analysis 
concentrates on the shift from R and D progressions in the first part of the 
song to chromatic third relations that emerge in the F major portion, 
culminating in a climactic M transformation from F to D flat (measure 63). His 
discussion includes correspondences between harmonic progressions and ideas in 
the text, and concludes by exploring how various melodic progressions in the 
vocal line directed toward high F operate within the harmonic structure.</p>

<p align="left">[12] <b>Example 2</b> offers what I believe is a useful expansion of Kopp&rsquo;s view of 
this song. The first graph (Example 2a) shows the opening vocal line (measures 10&ndash;11) 
moving from F to its first melodic goal, D flat, that arrives with the first 
change of harmony. The voice&rsquo;s next entrance is a sequential restatement (measures 18&ndash;19) in F sharp minor that pushes the D flat up to D natural before the 
tonality returns to F minor at the end of the stanza. The second graph (Example 
2b) is the vocal phrase at the beginning of the fourth stanza, where Schubert 
sets the climactic words &ldquo;take your bride&rdquo; with an ascent to the melodic zenith 
of the song (G flat) that is the seventh of V7 and that resolves to F 
concomitantly with the authentic cadence on D flat. The example indicates 
conspicuous cross-references between melodic details and larger harmonic 
relationships that link the beginning of the song with its climax. The initial 
move from F to D flat in the voice is expressed also by the harmonic shift from 
F to D flat in measure 63 and the cadence in measure 65; also at this 
cadence-point, the pitch classes of the tonal scheme in the opening of the song 
appear as a melodic gesture emphasizing the high G flat. This exchange of 
melodic and harmonic events suggests that both carry equivalent weight as 
determinants of structure in the song, but Kopp&rsquo;s harmonically-privileged 
approach cannot fully engage these important tonal processes. Another such 
melodic-harmonic process involves the conflict Schubert sets up between the two 
forms of the submediant, D flat and D natural. Both pitch classes occur in 
various contexts throughout the song (beginning with their functions in the keys 
of F minor and F sharp minor, as shown in Example 2a), but there is a 
large-scale conversion of D natural from the lowered submediant in F sharp to 
the diatonic submediant in F major within the &ldquo;Alleluja&rdquo; at the end, which 
parallels the progression of ideas in the text.</p>
<p align="left">[13] The book is written in an intelligent and straightforward style, and the 
layout, including tables and illustrations, is clear and legible. The text is 
highly accurate, but there are problems with a few of the illustrations. Figure 
1.6 (page 12) for instance, incorrectly identifies C major to B flat minor as a 
mediant relationship; Example 2.1b (page 19) is not the score excerpt to which the 
discussion refers; the clef and key signature for Figure 8.3 (page 197) are 
incorrect; and the climactic G flat in <i>Die junge Nonne</i> (measure 65) discussed above 
is shown as a G natural in Figure 9.12 (page 257).</p>
<p align="left">[14] Kopp&rsquo;s <i>Chromatic Transformations</i> is an ambitious study, particularly 
effective in its treatment of chromatic mediant relations. It successfully 
builds a new transformational system from Riemannian roots, yet offers an 
intriguing alternative to current neo-Riemannian theory. Despite certain 
limitations associated with the analytic method, Kopp&rsquo;s system proves to be 
useful in elucidating aspects of harmonic structure. The book stands as an 
important contribution to the study of nineteenth-century harmony from a 
transformational perspective.</p>
