polyphony. Although earlier approaches describe this technique as a way of using arpeggiation
to embellish a melodic line, disguise an otherwise unacceptable melodic progression, delay the
resolution of dissonance, or create underlying voice-leading patterns, these descriptions cannot
account for the variety and complexity of the implied polyphony in these pieces. This paper
presents an additional analytical approach that uses research on auditory stream segregation and
phenomenal accents to determine transitions between implied voices. Based on this type of
analysis, it is proposed that Bach did not treat implied polyphony as solely a melodic feature. He
instead used implied polyphony to apply irregular accent patterns to the isochronous surface of
the music, thereby creating perceived rhythmic variety at the fastest levels of the metric
hierarchy.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In contemplating Bach&#8217;s works for solo cello, Pablo Casals remarked, &#8220;It is fantastic to
think that with one note after the other there can be melody, the central voices and the bass all
together. A wonderful polyphony&#8212;and this is an invention of Bach. We have to give the
proper expression to each voice&#8221; (<a href="#blum_1977" id="citation_blum_1977_67e1575a02adc">Blum 1977</a>, 143&#8211;144). And in reference to Bach&#8217;s works for
solo violin, Jaap Schroeder observed, &#8220;We should also realize that Bach often writes a single
melodic line that has polyphonic implications which should be brought out in performance . . .
Bach and Telemann knew that a single melodic line, as well as two juxtaposed melodic lines,
could suggest polyphony and would be perceived as such by the listener if the player were
skillful&#8221; (<a href="#schroeder_1977" id="citation_schroeder_1977_67e1575a02adf">Schroeder 1977</a>, 10&#8211;12).<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> The compositional technique to which they refer is typically
called implied polyphony, compound melody, polyphonic melody, or pseudopolyphony. It is the
perception of multiple voices or melodic lines within a strictly monophonic texture.</p>
<p>[2] Most existing analytical approaches focus on identifying the underlying voice-leading
patterns that are created by implied polyphony, both within and between implied voices. Fewer
studies combine this analysis with an investigation of the degree to which these implied voices
are perceived by listeners and emphasized by performers. After a brief survey of previous
approaches, this paper presents an additional way to analyze implied polyphony and hear these
pieces. Rather than focusing solely on harmony or voice-leading, this analysis is based on
perceptual principles of auditory stream segregation and generates alternate interpretations of the
number of implied voices and the content of each voice. This approach draws attention to the
rhythmic effects of implied polyphony by highlighting how transitions from one implied voice to
another create phenomenal accents that might otherwise not be present. In many instances, these
implied voice changes generate a sense of syncopation by creating groupings of attacks at the
fastest level of the metric hierarchy that are contrary to the accent patterns of the notated meter.
This preserves a fundamental characteristic of Bach&#8217;s metric structure that could be lost if the
music is perceived as unrelentingly monophonic and isochronous.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Earlier Approaches to Implied Polyphony
</b> </p>
<p>[3] In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, implied polyphony was most often described
as a way to transform a multi-voiced harmonic progression into a single melodic line through the
use of arpeggiation. Among the many possible roots of this practice was the Baroque style bris&eacute; (&#8220;broken style&#8221;), a technique that lute players often used to adapt the improvisatory style of
thoroughbass accompaniment to their own solo instrumental repertoire. Since a lute is not
capable of performing sustained tones, arpeggiation provided a way to play chordal passages that
still had a sense of voice-leading. Performers of other instruments soon adopted this stylized
form of arpeggiation, with the well-known Prelude in C Major from Book I of Bach&#8217;s 
<i>Das
wohltemperierte Clavier</i> providing a clear example of how a Baroque composer would write out
the arpeggiations of a simple harmonic progression for performance on a keyboard instrument.
</p>
<p>[4] Various eighteenth-century theoretical treatises reflect a similar approach to explaining
implied polyphony. Johann Mattheson (<a href="#mattheson_1739" id="citation_mattheson_1739_67e1575a02ae4">1739</a>) called this technique the &#8220;theory of broken
chords&#8221; and devoted an entire chapter of <i>Der volkommene Capellmeister</i> to illustrating the
different ways that arpeggiation can be used to represent various polyphonic textures. To
Mattheson, &#8220;breaking&#8221; meant that &#8220;the pitches are not perceived together all at once but one after
another&#8221; (<a href="#harris_1981" id="citation_harris_1981_67e1575a02af7">Harris 1981</a>, 670). This technique was therefore a way of reducing the total number of
voices while still retaining the full harmonic content. Johann Philipp Kirnberger (<a href="#kirnberger_1774" id="citation_kirnberger_1774_67e1575a02af9">1774</a>)
discussed &#8220;Embellished or Florid Simple Counterpoint&#8221; in the eleventh chapter of 
<i>Die Kunst des
reinen Satzes in der Musik</i> and demonstrated how arpeggiation could be used to transform
various multi-part pieces into monophonic melodies.
</p>
<p>[5] Kirnberger also referred to implied polyphony in his discussion of how to treat
augmented and diminished intervals and thereby avoid &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; melodic progressions. As
one method of disguising these intervals, Kirnberger stated that &#8220;when a single-line melody is
composed in such a way that its harmony is implied and sounds like a two- or three-part piece,
the forbidden progressions no longer sound bad&#8221; (<a href="#beach_and_thym_1982" id="citation_beach_and_thym_1982_67e1575a02afb">Beach and Thym 1982</a>, 156). Johann David
Heinichen (<a href="#heinichen_1728" id="citation_heinichen_1728_67e1575a02afd">1728</a>) shared a similar perspective and &#8220;acknowledges implied voices as a way of
explaining unconventional leaps to dissonances as well as delayed resolution of dissonances&#8221;
(<a href="#rothfarb_1988" id="citation_rothfarb_1988_67e1575a02aff">Rothfarb 1988</a>, 103). For instance, it is typical to follow a suspended note with its immediate
resolution. Heinichen considered delayed resolutions of suspensions to be acceptable if the
intervening pitches provide variations that postpone the moment of resolution. Since these
variations sometimes contain large interval separations, they often create a texture where the
notes of suspension and resolution belong to one implied voice and the intervening pitches
belong to another. Ornamenting a dissonance prior to its resolution could therefore create a
sense of implied polyphony.
</p>
<p>[6] Two twentieth century theorists, Heinrich Schenker and Ernst Kurth, also wrote
extensively about implied polyphony. Although there are fundamental differences in their
approaches, both Schenker and Kurth were essentially searching for linear progressions that are
not explicitly stated at the foreground of the music. But these progressions did not necessarily
represent the same thing, nor did they always possess the same characteristics. According to
Schenker&#8217;s theory, implied polyphony is associated with the basic principles of arpeggiation,
diminution, and voice-leading. As Forte and Gilbert described, &#8220;Whereas the arpeggiation is the
projection of a single voice through the notes of a consonant triad, compound melody involves
arpeggiation and partial arpeggiation in the more elaborate sense . . . as conveyors of two or
more voices over a longer span of music&#8221; (<a href="#forte_and_gilbert_1982" id="citation_forte_and_gilbert_1982_67e1575a02b02">1982</a>, 67&#8211;68). Kurth, on the other hand, suggested
that these underlying linear progressions are implied or apparent voices (&#8220;Scheinstimme&#8221;) that
are created by &#8220;manifest characteristics of linear contour and their psycho-auditive
ramifications&#8221; (<a href="#rothfarb_1988" id="citation_rothfarb_1988_67e1575a02b03">Rothfarb 1988</a>, 37).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
This reflects Kurth&rsquo;s interest in psychology and his insistence that polyphonic 
melody is a linear (or melodic) feature, rather than a solely harmonic
one. As he stated, &#8220;The line did not emerge from primary, latent harmonic formation, but rather,
conversely, embodies in its form the harmonic factors out of which grows harmonic meaning in
developed musical consciousness&#8221; (<a href="#rothfarb_1988" id="citation_rothfarb_1988_67e1575a02b06">Rothfarb 1988</a>, 79). In his writings on this topic, Kurth used
multiple examples from Bach&#8217;s solo string works to demonstrate how registral prominence,
harmonic dissonance, melodic dissonance, and directional interruption are used to create a sense
of polyphonic melody. Unlike Schenker&#8217;s voice-leading reductions, Kurth&#8217;s apparent voices
occur in both ascending and descending patterns and sometimes contain intervals greater than a
second. In addition, Kurth made no attempt to present any systematic method for determining
the content of these Scheinstimme.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>A Perceptual Approach to Analyzing Implied Polyphony
</b> </p>
<p>[7] Many instances of implied polyphony in Bach&#8217;s unaccompanied string pieces can be
explained by these principles of arpeggiation, delayed dissonance resolution, and voice-leading.
However, while arpeggiation may be a straightforward procedure when the number of voices
remains fixed and when all voices sound continuously, most instances of Bach&#8217;s implied
polyphony contain an ambiguous or changing number of voices. Implied voices seem to emerge
and then vanish, a circumstance that is not easily derived from arpeggiation techniques alone.
Likewise, a lack of voice continuity can present challenges for following the content of each
implied voice over the course of an entire piece. It is therefore proposed that an analysis of
arpeggiation and voice-leading be supplemented with an analysis of listening and perception.
This perceptual approach was influenced by research on auditory stream segregation, which aims
to identify the characteristics of sound that might cause a monophonic tone sequence to be
perceived in multiple streams. Emphasis is therefore shifted back toward the original
monophonic sequence and away from a reduction that reflects an imagined substrate of fully
contrapuntal, previously composed material.
</p>
<p>[8] The fundamental principles of auditory stream segregation can be viewed 
as modern formulations of the laws of Gestalt psychology (particularly the law 
of proximity). According to this body of research, the tendency for certain 
monophonic tone sequences to split into multiple perceptual streams is a 
function of the auditory system, with segregation being most powerfully affected 
by the frequency separation between tones in a sequence (interval size) and the 
rate of presentation of tones in that sequence (tempo). In general, a monophonic 
sequence is most likely to split into separate perceptual streams when it 
contains large intervals and is played at rapid tempos.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>[9] From a theoretical approach, the large intervals that are crucial to stream segregation give
emphasis to specific pitches and create examples of what Lerdahl and Jackendoff (<a href="#lerdahl_and_jackendoff_1983" id="citation_lerdahl_and_jackendoff_1983_67e1575a02b0a">1983</a>) call
phenomenal accents. These phenomenal accents play a role in delineating both grouping and
metric structure. For instance, Lerdahl and Jackendoff&#8217;s third grouping preference rule states
that the transition between two notes will be heard as a grouping boundary if its interval is larger
than those that both precede and follow it. Music cognition research has also contributed
information about the perception of melodic accents. Boltz and Jones (<a href="#boltz_and_jones_1986" id="citation_boltz_and_jones_1986_67e1575a02b0c">1986</a>) 
proposed that changes in interval size and contour create melodic accents, with 
the accent being placed on the pitch that follows the change. When these changes 
occur at regularly spaced intervals of time, melodies are perceived to be 
simpler and easier to remember. In contrast, unexpected or temporally irregular 
changes create melodic complexity and become &#8220;psychologically important because they mark deviations in a pattern&#8217;s context and thus capture a listener&#8217;s attention&#8221; (<a href="#boltz_and_jones_1986" id="citation_boltz_and_jones_1986_67e1575a02b0e">Boltz and Jones 1986</a>, 407).
</p>
<p>[10] Although Boltz and Jones made no specific mention of implied polyphony in their study,
they still focused on the two structural features that play the most important role in its creation.
If the combination of large intervals and changes of contour creates a sense of melodic accent,
then implied polyphony also creates a sense of melodic accent (since stream segregation is
caused by the same two structural features). The accents created by changes from one implied
voice to another activate the isochronous, monophonic musical texture and create meaningful
rhythmic activity at the fastest level of the metric hierarchy. The fact that Bach avoids placing
these changes at regularly spaced intervals of time contributes to the increased complexity of
these melodies, as well as to their potential to &#8220;capture a listener&#8217;s attention.&#8221;
</p>
<p>[11] This approach to explaining the rhythmic effects of implied polyphony coincides with
Carl Schachter&#8217;s (<a href="#schachter_1976" id="citation_schachter_1976_67e1575a02b1d">1976</a>) definition of &#8220;tonal rhythms.&#8221; In an essay intended mostly as a defense
against the claim that Schenkerian theory neglected the analysis of rhythm, Schachter described
rhythm as having two main components&#8212;tonal rhythms and durational rhythms. Tonal rhythms
are those that &#8220;flow from the succession and combination of tones, for the tonal system itself has
rhythmic properties&#8221; (313). With this definition, Schachter is referring to the rhythmic patterns
that can be created by tonal (or pitch-related) elements such as &#8220;the recurrence of a tone after one
or more different ones, the octave relationship, chordal and linear associations, consonance and
dissonance&#8221; (313). Durational rhythms, on the other hand, are those created by actual variations
in duration and grouping, without any respect to the specific pitches that are used.
</p>
<p>[12] Schachter subsequently stated that &#8220;tonal rhythm is most easily 
perceived where there is little or no durational patterning&#8221; (315). This would 
certainly apply to the monophonic and isochronous movements from Bach&#8217;s solo 
string music. Although the continuous repetition of a single duration eliminates 
the possibility of variety in the durational rhythms, tonal rhythms are created 
by accent patterns that emerge as the melody switches from one implied voice to 
another. Schachter summarized by saying that since the rhythmic character of any 
piece is a combination of both durational and tonal elements, &#8220;the same 
&#8216;rhythmic figure&#8217; can embody different rhythms, depending upon what the tones 
do&#8221; (326). The presence or absence of implied polyphony can therefore affect 
what the &#8220;tones do&#8221; and allow the same isochronous rhythmic figures to &#8220;embody 
different rhythms.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>[13] This research on stream segregation, melodic accent, and tonal rhythms informed the
analysis of the specific points at which Bach&#8217;s monophonic lines would be perceived to separate
into multiple implies voices. Using this approach, the likelihood of segregation between
consecutive pitches is determined by the relationship between interval size (large intervals vs.
conjunct motion) and melodic contour (<a href="#davis_2006" id="citation_davis_2006_67e1575a02b20">Davis 2006</a>). As van Noorden&#8217;s (<a href="#van_noorden_1975" id="citation_van_noorden_1975_67e1575a02b22">1975</a>) research
indicates, streams played at rapid speeds tend to divide into multiple streams when the interval
separation is greater than five semitones. The perfect fourth was therefore chosen as the smallest
interval that might suggest a change from one implied voice to another.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Perceptual research has
also shown that V-shaped contours are more likely to split into multiple streams than linear
contours (<a href="#heise_and_miller_1951" id="citation_heise_and_miller_1951_67e1575a02b25">Heise and Miller 1951</a>).<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> An immediate change of contour on either side of a large
interval therefore strengthens the likelihood of segregation. Conjunct motion surrounding a large
interval is also considered, thus accounting for the fact that two stepwise melodic lines that are
separated by a large interval will likely be perceived as two distinct implied voices. In the
analyses that follow, circled notes mark the point of transition between different implied voices
as determined by large interval size, change of contour, and significant change in interval size
relative to the surrounding pitches. </p>
<p>[14] Although melodies that are influenced by these perceptual tendencies can be created
using the previously mentioned compositional devices (arpeggiation, dissonance resolution, and
voice-leading), this approach emphasizes the perceptual tendencies in order to investigate the
degree to which they can offer an additional explanation for how these pieces can be heard.
Also, this approach does not attempt to identify the total number of implied voices or to follow
the path of each voice over the course of any passage of music. A general analysis of all
movements from these pieces (both polyphonic and monophonic) shows that Bach frequently
varied the number of simultaneous voices, thus making it difficult to identify a continuous
melodic path for each voice. One therefore needs a fluid approach to the total number of implied
voices and an acceptance of the lack of complete melodic continuity within implied voices over
the course of an entire piece. Analyzing the music in this way identifies the salient points of
transition between one implied voice and another, as well as the locations where such a change
might add a phenomenal accent to the otherwise isochronous texture and thereby affect the
rhythmic and metric (rather than just the melodic or contrapuntal) characteristics of the piece.

measures of the Sarabande Double from Bach&#8217;s Partita No. 1 in B minor.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Forte and Gilbert&#8217;s
Schenkerian analysis of this passage is based on fundamental principles of arpeggiation and
diminution, with emphasis placed on how the diminutions in the Double create an elaboration of
the basic voice-leading patterns in the original Sarabande. Example 1b shows their reduction of
this passage, with the different voices in the Double verticalized to show the underlying voiceleading
connections (<a href="#forte_and_gilbert_1982" id="citation_forte_and_gilbert_1982_67e1575a02c0b">Forte and Gilbert 1982</a>, 79).
</p>
<p>[16] Example 1a shows an alternate analysis of this passage. Instead of focusing on
underlying voice-leading patterns, this analysis simply identifies the points at which this
monophonic line will most likely split into different perceptual streams. This fission is caused
by the basic principles of auditory stream segregation (rapid tempos, large intervals surrounded
by conjunct motion, and changing contours). Based on these principles, the arpeggiation of a
single harmony (the B minor triad) and the subsequent small intervals will keep the first two
beats of this passage fused as a single voice (<a href="#bregman_1990" id="citation_bregman_1990_67e1575a02c1c">Bregman 1990</a>). The first perceived voice change
would therefore occur at the leap to the A5 in the third beat of measure 1. Although Forte and
Gilbert acknowledge that the descending third motion that begins with this note (moving from
A5-G5-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5) is an important motive of the Double, this pitch is not a part of their voice-leading
reduction. A similar situation also arises at the E5 in measure 3 and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 in the first beat of
measure 4.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>

<p>[17] Both of these approaches produce valid analyses of implied polyphony. They also
produce different, valid ways that a listener might hear the compound melody in a passage such
as this. One could pay attention to arpeggiation and diminution patterns in order to hear an
underlying voice-leading or harmonic structure. Or one could instead be attracted by
phenomenal accents that are created by transitions from one implied auditory stream to another
at the surface of the music. Cambouropoulos (<a href="#cambouropoulos_2006" id="citation_cambouropoulos_2006_67e1575a02c22">2006</a>) summarized the difference between these
two interpretations by stating that auditory stream segregation &#8220;determines how successions of
musical events are perceived as belonging to coherent sequences and, at the same time,
segregated from other independent musical sequences,&#8221; while a more harmonic or contrapuntal
approach suggests that &#8220;tones that correspond to the implied chords may be considered as
implying a horizontal organization into a number of separate voices&#8221; (2).

<p>[18] In some passages from Bach&#8217;s pieces, these two approaches produce similar analyses.
For instance, the excerpt in <b>Example 2</b> contains a one-measure motive that is sequenced in a
descending, stepwise pattern. This sequential repetition creates a sense of voice-leading between
the notes on the downbeat of each measure. Due to the interaction between large intervals,
conjunct motion, and changes of contour, this motive could also be perceived as containing three
implied voices, with each voice inhabiting its own registral space and thus creating three distinct
descending melodic lines within the overall sequential repetition. Because the change from one
voice to the next always occurs on a weak beat of the measure, and because that pitch is always
the highest in the texture, the implied polyphony allows this sequence to also be perceived as
beginning on the second eighth note of each measure. This metric shift highlights the voiceleading
pattern in the top voice (C6-B5-A5-G5) and creates a middle voice that emphasizes the
last eighth note of each measure (D5-C5-B4-A4), rather the downbeats of each measure (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5-
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5-B4-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4). But whichever sequence is chosen, a perceptual analysis and a traditional voiceleading
analysis identify the same three implied voices in this passage.
</p>
<p>[19] Other passages from these pieces highlight the difference between analyzing implied
polyphony from a compositional, voice-leading approach and a perceptual, stream segregation
approach. In these passages, implied voice changes are created by the repetition of a single
motive (or parts of a motive) in various ranges or by large interval separations between the legs
of a sequence. The implied polyphony therefore cannot be explained as mere harmonic
arpeggiations or voice-leading patterns. It instead helps to foster a sense of successive grouping
structure as certain implied voices state the motive(s) and others are momentarily silent.

<p>[20] The excerpt in <b>Example 3</b> is characterized by groups of descending sixteenth notes, each
separated by large interval leaps that create a change of contour. If these large intervals were
eliminated through the use of octave transfer, this passage would consist entirely of an extended
descending scale. As a result, these leaps not only allowed Bach to compose a lengthy scalar
passage while limited by the lower range restrictions of the violin, but also to create an
interesting perceptual illusion by placing literal descending motion in a passage that ascends in
overall pitch height. In addition, the large interval leaps place phenomenal accents on the
highest note of each group of sixteenth notes and create the perception that a new implied voice
has entered the texture at that moment. Although these voice changes do not create a sense of
stepwise voice-leading, and although all of these implied voices overlap in range, the listener can
still get the impression that a similar motive is being passed around multiple implied voices.

<p>[21] <b>Example 4</b> displays a passage from Bach&#8217;s D minor Chaconne that contains a descending,
stepwise sequence of a one-measure motive. Large interval leaps and changes of contour
highlight the transition from one implied voice to another, with each voice containing either a
single pitch or exclusively conjunct motion. Based on repetition within each leg of the sequence,
these implied voice changes create three distinct motives. The highest voice contains a single
pitch and creates a descending, stepwise melodic line from one measure to the next (indicated
with + on the score). The seven descending sixteenth notes that occupy the middle of each
measure create a second motive, with the last note of each statement of the motive creating
another stepwise descent that functions as a perceived bass line (indicated with * on the score).
A third voice contains just three sixteenth notes (the last two of each measure and the downbeat
of the next measure). This voice completely overlaps the pitch space of the bass voice, but
placement of the last note on the downbeat emphasizes another stepwise descent and creates a
perceived alto voice within the overall texture (indicated with ^ on the score). Although range is
no longer identifying the content of three simultaneously streamed voices, Bach still combined
large intervals, conjunct motion, changes of contour, and motivic repetition in a way that would
create the perception of three different implied voices in a brief monophonic passage.
</p>
<p>[22] To summarize, this approach suggests that there is sometimes a difference between
implied voice-leading and the perception of multiple implied voices in a passage of monophonic
music. Bach&#8217;s use of implied polyphony went beyond arpeggiating originally homophonic
material or elaborating the resolution of dissonance. In addition, the voice-leading patterns that
can be identified by other analytical approaches do not always coincide with the moments in a
monophonic texture that might be perceived as the transition between two implied voices.
Therefore, the focus of these analyses is to identify melodic features that are influenced by
perceptual tendencies involved in stream segregation. Highlighting these features examines the
degree to which basic auditory phenomena affect the perception of implied polyphony in
complex music, generates an analysis that identifies moments of likely fission and phenomenal
accent, and provides an additional perceptually relevant way to interpret these pieces that can
stand beside other analytical approaches.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Implied Polyphony and Perceived Rhythm </b> </p>
<p>[23] In a previous study, empirical research methods were used to examine the extent to which
listeners are aware of and affected by the frequency and clarity of implied voice changes in
Bach&#8217;s solo string music (<a href="#davis_2006" id="citation_davis_2006_67e1575a02c3b">Davis 2006</a>). Results indicated that the presence or absence of implied
polyphony affects the aesthetic evaluation of these pieces, with original passages containing
implied polyphony being judged to be significantly more &#8220;engaging&#8221; than those that were
recomposed (using octave transfer) to eliminate the implied polyphony as much as possible. This
suggests that implied polyphony adds some degree of expression to the notes themselves, as
opposed to the typical sources of performed expression (e.g., rubato, dynamics, articulation, and
vibrato).<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> It is proposed that this structural expression is at least partially created by the way the
implied polyphony interacts with and affects the perception of rhythmic and metric structure.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>
<p>[24] One possible distinction between Bach&#8217;s treatment of meter and that of later composers is
the degree of attention given to the fastest levels of the metric hierarchy. Rather than
emphasizing the measure level and treating the faster metric levels as mere subdivisions, Bach
typically created significant and purposeful activity at all metric levels. He accomplished this by
placing different simultaneous rhythmic patterns and accent structures in the various polyphonic
voices or instrumental parts of a given composition.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Joel Lester provided evidence for this idea
by comparing the &#8220;regularity of patternings and accentuations at the fastest levels&#8221; in the music
of Mozart and Beethoven with the &#8220;greater complexity of accentuation patterns at the fastest
levels&#8221; in the music of Bach. A distinction is therefore made between metric levels that are
perceived as &#8220;subdivisions of larger groupings&#8221; and those that &#8220;become a possible focus of
attention (<a href="#lester_1986" id="citation_lester_1986_67e1575a02c41">1986</a>, 127).<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> </p>
<p>[25] Bach could easily articulate each level of the metric hierarchy by placing different accent
patterns in various instrumental groups or timbres. But these different instruments or voices do
not exist in monophonic music. In his unaccompanied string works, Bach defined the slower
levels of the metric hierarchy with regularities in harmonic rhythm and sequential (or motivic)
repetition. He then used implied polyphony as one method of creating contrametric accents at
the fastest level of the metric hierarchy, where isochronous rhythms would have left a rhythmic
surface devoid of any differentiation. Transitions between implied voices were placed on weak
beats at this fastest level, which highlighted otherwise unaccented foreground notes and created a
sense of tension against the established and regular pulse. Surface rhythms that might have
become a &#8220;mere stream of activity filling the space between downbeats&#8221; (<a href="#lester_1986" id="citation_lester_1986_67e1575a02c44">Lester 1986</a>, 153) were
instead enlivened by a clever manipulation of musical texture and the foreground of these pieces
acquired the potential to become a focus of the listener&#8217;s attention.
</p>
<p>[26] Bach further emphasized these metric irregularities by avoiding any consistent use of
implied polyphony throughout an entire piece. The musical texture instead moves freely
between passages that are truly monophonic (meaning only that a single note is played at one
time) and passages that contain different instantiations of implied polyphony. Attention is
therefore only periodically drawn to the alternate surface rhythm patterns that are created by the
various durations between implied voice changes. In this way, the structural features that create
implied polyphony (rapid tempos, large intervals, and changing contours) compensate for the
lack of foreground rhythmic differentiation in these pieces by generating what are often called
&#8220;inherent&#8221; rhythms.
</p>
<p>[27] Carterette and Kendall (<a href="#carterette_and_kendall_1999" id="citation_carterette_and_kendall_1999_67e1575a02c46">1999</a>) define inherent rhythms as:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>. . . patterns that emerge from the overall melodic-rhythmic complex and are not
produced directly by any musician. Prerequisites of these inherent auditory patterns are a
very quick sequence of notes; many jerky intervals with an ensuing split into pitch layers;
and a regular internal structure of an entire passage so that high, low, and middle pitch
layers form distinct rhythmic melodies (760&#8211;761).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These inherent rhythms are the opposite of composite rhythms, which have been defined as the
&#8220;durational pattern of all parts in a texture&#8221; that is &#8220;neither expressed nor approximated by any
single part in the texture (<a href="#lester_1986" id="citation_lester_1986_67e1575a02c48">Lester 1986</a>, 6). A polyphonic passage containing various rhythmic
patterns in each voice (or instrumental part) could therefore have a composite rhythm of
continuous sixteenth notes. In contrast, many of the monophonic movements from Bach&#8217;s
unaccompanied string pieces already contain these isochronous surface rhythms. Bach therefore
needed a way to create the rhythmic variety that existed in the truly polyphonic compositions.
Implied polyphony provided one source of foreground phenomenal accents that could produce
these inherent rhythmic patterns.
</p>
<p>[28] Bach generated these surface rhythms and had them interact with the underlying voiceleading
in a variety of different ways. Some passages containing implied polyphony can be
separated into multiple voices that each maintain their own pitch space. A clear sense of melodic
continuity is created and it is possible for a listener to follow the path of each implied voice over
the course of an entire passage (as in the excerpt shown in Example 2). The rhythm of each
individual voice thus creates rhythmic patterns that are perceived but not explicitly performed.

<p>[29] An illustration of this can be found in the opening eight measures of the Minuet II from
Bach&#8217;s Cello Suite No. 1 in G major. <b>Example 5a</b> shows the score of this excerpt, with circles
placed around notes that serve as the transition between three different implied voices. Each of
these voices follows stepwise motion and large intervals separate the different voices. 
<b>Example
5b</b> shows the inherent rhythmic pattern of each voice. Metric placement of each pitch is
maintained and non-consecutive pitches belonging to a single implied voice are lengthened,
thereby highlighting the rhythmic interplay between the three voices. Agogic accents place
emphasis on the second beat of each measure in the highest voice, the third beat of each measure
in the middle voice, and the downbeat of every other measure in the bass voice. Each voice is
therefore given its own rhythmic space in the overall musical texture and a pattern of inherent
rhythms is created as the change from one implied voice to another receives a phenomenal
accent. This analysis can be compared to Forte and Gilbert&#8217;s voice-leading reduction of the first
four measures of the same passage (see <b>Example 6</b>).<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In this analysis, &#8220;the voices are verticalized
to show the voice-leading connections as though the three voices were literally present at every
moment instead of being presented in the form of a compound melody&#8221; (<a href="#forte_and_gilbert_1982" id="citation_forte_and_gilbert_1982_67e1575a02c5d">Forte and Gilbert 1982</a>, 70). This places emphasis on the underlying voice-leading and implied harmony, rather than on
phenomenal accents created by stream segregation.
</p>
<p>[30] Many other passages from Bach&#8217;s pieces lack the clear sense of melodic continuity
exhibited by the implied voices in this Minuet. The implied polyphony in these passages instead
creates something more similar to syncopation, where the accentuation of weak beats within a
regular metric construct contradicts the prevailing meter or pulse. These accents are created
when changes of voice (or entrances of new voices) are placed on weak beats at the fastest level
of the metric hierarchy, thereby causing stronger beats to feel either anticipated or delayed and
creating an &#8220;expressive surface.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Identifying these implied voice changes allows for the
perception of an additional set of inherent rhythms overlaid onto the original isochronous stream
of pitches, with that part containing various syncopated rhythmic patterns that enliven the texture
and contradict the listener&#8217;s expectations.

<p>[31] An example of this can be found in a passage from the Allemande of Bach&#8217;s Violin
Partita No. 2 in D minor. <b>Example 7a</b> shows the original score of measures 4&#8211;7 and 
<b>Example 7b</b>
notates the implied voice changes as a continuous rhythmic stream. The opening of this excerpt
highlights the relationship between interval size and contour in creating implied voice changes.
Based on interval size alone, measure 4 contains five possible changes of implied voice (since
each of these intervals is &#8805; P4). However, only three of these intervals are indicated as signaling
a change to a new implied voice. The two ascending perfect fourths (C5-F5 and D5-G5)
continue triadic arpeggiations and are not surrounded by changes in contour, thus making them
unlikely to trigger stream segregation or receive phenomenal accents. This measure also
contains motivic repetition, with the repetition being delineated by changes in implied voice.
Bach consistently started motives and sequential repetitions on weak beats, therefore making it
likely that the motive in measure 4 begins on the second sixteenth note of the measure and lasts
two full beats. This motive is sequenced up a step after a change in implied voice on the second
sixteenth note of the third beat. Within this motive, however, exists a stepwise, ascending, two-note
pattern. This pattern always begins and ends with a change in contour as related to the rest
of the two-beat motive. When combined with the large intervals, this contour change suggests a
new implied voice and serves to isolate those two notes from the rest of the motive. Bach
fragmented this two-note pattern from the rest of the motive at the beginning of measure 5, with
large intervals and changes of contour again highlighting the entrance of a new implied voice at
the beginning of each repetition.
</p>
<p>[32] After identifying these implied voice changes, it would be natural to try to determine the
total number of implied voices and the content of each voice over the course of the entire
passage. However, most of these implied voice changes delineate motivic repetition, thereby
creating successive (rather than simultaneous) grouping structure. The content of all implied
voices overlaps in pitch space and it is impossible to use range as a way of identifying and
following the path of each voice. Unlike the Corrente excerpt in Example 2 and the Minuet
excerpt in Example 5, the implied voices in the Allemande are not being simultaneously
streamed throughout the passage. Instead, the voice changes create the impression that different
motives are being passed between multiple implied voices. Since these voice changes tend to
occur on weak beats and over irregular intervals of time, the accents that occur at the beginning
of each change of voice create the inherent rhythmic pattern shown in Example 7b. Listeners
could therefore allow principles of auditory stream segregation to highlight this pattern of
accents or allow principles of harmony and counterpoint to instead draw their attention to voiceleading
connections between non-consecutive pitches.
</p>
<p>[33] As a point of comparison, <b>Example 7c </b>contains a revised version of this same passage.
This revision was created by applying octave transfer to the largest intervals in order to diminish
the sense of implied polyphony as much as possible. Examining the inherent rhythmic pattern of
this revised version reveals how the presence or absence of implied polyphony dramatically
changes the rhythmic character of this passage (see <b>Example 7d</b>). For instance, the original
version of measures 6&#8211;7 contains the largest intervals of this entire excerpt. These large intervals
are surrounded by conjunct motion and changes in contour, thereby creating the clear perception
of two implied voices. Accents are placed on weak beats at the fastest level of the metric
hierarchy as the melody changes from one implied voice to the other. When octave transfer is
applied to these measures, most of the large intervals and contour changes necessary for stream
segregation disappear. The resulting reduction of implied polyphony eliminates many of the
surface accents that created syncopated inherent rhythms in Bach&#8217;s original version of this
passage.

<p>[34] A similar passage can be found in the closing measures of the Fugue from Violin Sonata
No. 1 in G minor (see <b>Example 8</b>). In this two-measure sequence, the interaction between large
intervals, changes of contour, conjunct motion, and fast tempo creates the obvious perception of
two implied voices. Each of these voices occupies its own range of pitch space and creates a
lengthy descending scale (the upper one diatonic and the lower one chromatic), with two-note
fragments of each scale alternating between the two implied voices. Because phenomenal
accents can be perceived at the entrance of each new voice (or the return to the previous voice),
Bach&#8217;s use of implied polyphony emphasizes the second and fourth sixteenth notes in each beat
and creates a sense of syncopation (see inherent rhythmic pattern shown in Example 8b).
</p>
<p>[35] Example 8c shows a revised version of this same passage, where octave transfer was
again used to diminish the sense of implied polyphony. Although the same sequence and
underlying voice-leading patterns still exist, there is no longer a clear sense of two distinct voices
trading off with each other. Without the phenomenal accents created by stream segregation, the
sense of syncopated inherent rhythms is reduced. The entire sequence could now be perceived as
a monophonic melody that follows a descending D major scale created by the notes that fall at
the beginning of each beat, thus emphasizing the arrival on the dominant chord in measure 93. A
listener might also hear this scale as being chromatic, elaborated by the pitches that fall on the
last sixteenth note of each beat. If this is the case, a voice-leading pattern that matches the lower
implied voice of the Bach&#8217;s original melody is created. But the upper voice that was once made
obvious by differences in interval size and range is now hidden in the texture and less likely to be
noticed.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>

<p>[36] The relationship between implied polyphony, voice-leading, and syncopation can also be
found in the excerpt shown in <b>Example 9</b>. Kurth (<a href="#kurth_1917" id="citation_kurth_1917_67e1575a02c76">1917</a>) analyzed this passage and identified an
&#8220;apparent voice&#8221; that contains the first and fourth sixteenth notes of each measure (see Example
9b).<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> This suggests that he was emphasizing motivic parallelism, registral reversals, and rhythmic
consistency in his analysis. He then left this regular rhythm behind in the middle of measure 2 in
order to highlight the stepwise descent to the tonic pitch that occurs within the first beat of
measure 3. This reflects Kurth&#8217;s desire to find stepwise linear progressions beneath the surface
of the music and to identify &#8220;hidden&#8221; statements of the main motives at this more background
level.
</p>
<p>[37] An analysis based on principles of stream segregation suggests another possible
interpretation. Example 9c indicates the inherent rhythmic pattern that emerges as pitches acting
as transitions between different implied voice receive phenomenal accents. Instead of
highlighting motivic parallelism, rhythmic consistency, and voice leading, the metric placement
of these implied voice changes creates an irregular accent pattern that adds a syncopated inherent
rhythm to the original isochronous melody. This is particularly apparent in the first two voice
changes (the G5 in m. 1 and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5 in m. 2), which place accents on the second sixteenth note
of a strong beat rather than on the strong beats themselves (as in Kurth&#8217;s analysis). But both
analyses outline the same implied voices at the end of m. 2, an upper voice containing ascending
motion from B4-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5-D5 and a lower voice descending from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4-E4-D4-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4-B3. The main
difference is that Kurth only notates the lower implied voice, while the inherent rhythmic pattern
created by a perceptually-based analysis acknowledges that the two voices alternate with each
other as they move in contrary motion. Since accents are placed on the beginning note of each
new implied voice (or on the note that continues a previously implied voice that was
momentarily latent), the quick alternation between these two implied voices creates an inherent
rhythmic pattern that briefly matches the surface rhythms of the piece. Listeners could choose to
follow the content of each voice separately, thus highlighting the two melodic lines in contrary
motion, or their attention could instead be drawn to phenomenal accents that create an inherent
rhythmic pattern as implied voices transition from one to the next at varying rates of speed.

<p>[38] A final excerpt shows how implied polyphony can create a variety of different perceived
rhythmic patterns over the course of a longer passage of music. <b>Example 10a</b> contains the first
half of the Presto from Bach&#8217;s Violin Sonata No. 1 in G minor and <b>Example 10b</b> contains the
inherent rhythmic pattern of the implied voice changes. Although an analysis based on harmony
and voice-leading would identify multiple melodic components in the lengthy arpeggiation in
measures 1&#8211;4, perceptual principles suggest that harmony fuses pitches together into a single
voice (<a href="#bregman_1990" id="citation_bregman_1990_67e1575a02c89">Bregman 1990</a>). When this is combined with the lack of large intervals, it is unlikely that
this arpeggiation would separate into multiple perceptual streams. But even without implied
polyphony, the different accent patterns of this passage already place emphasis on multiple levels
of the metric hierarchy and make it possible for the opening bars of this piece to be interpreted in
either 3/8 or 6/16. One could hear the continuous repetition of the original three-note pattern
outlining an overall arpeggiation of the tonic chord, with a new note of the chord being
introduced every half measure. Or one could instead hear a two-note pattern whose first note
outlines the same tonic chord at the measure level, thereby dividing each measure into three
beats.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Like implied polyphony, this metric ambiguity draws attention to the fastest level of the
metric hierarchy in an isochronous passage of music.
</p>
<p>[39] As the piece continues, implied polyphony creates a variety of different effects. In
measures 17&#8211;24, changes of voice are only suggested because large interval leaps occur between
each leg of a sequence. When combined with overall stepwise sequential motion, these large
intervals highlight the first note of each sequential leg and allow an underlying sense of voiceleading
to be perceived. These voice changes occur on downbeats, thereby corresponding
exactly with the underlying harmonic rhythm and the slower levels of the metric hierarchy. The
implied polyphony in this passage therefore does not create any syncopated surface rhythms. By
comparison, the smaller intervals, narrower range, and simple chord arpeggiations in measures 9&#8211;11 will likely generate the perception of a single voice even though a sense of voice-leading is
still created by the sequential repetition.
</p>
<p>[40] In contrast, other implied voice changes accent weak beats in the 
fastest level of the metric hierarchy and create syncopated, inherent rhythmic 
patterns. For instance, the voice changes in measures 12&#8211;16 place accents on the 
second and sixth notes of each measure, thereby creating syncopation and 
animating the otherwise isochronous rhythms. Similarly, measures 32&#8211;34 contain a 
descending, stepwise motive that is passed between multiple implied voices. 
Because these implied voice changes occur on the weakest sixteenth notes in each 
measure, this passage creates a sense of syncopation against the measure-level 
pulse (see discussion of Example 3). </p>
<p>[41] Bach also used implied voice changes 
to create metric ambiguities at the level just below the one-measure tactus, 
thus making it possible to interpret this piece as constantly shifting between 
duple and triple metric structures. For example, the large intervals that occur 
in the middle of measures 25&#8211;28 create two implied voices&#8212;a lower voice that 
contains a three-note ascending, stepwise pattern and an upper voice that 
contains a three-note neighbor tone figure that serves as a pedal point. Because 
the alternation between these two motives is consistent, and because it is 
reinforced by changes in articulation, the voice changes in these measures 
compel the listener to hear the piece in a duple meter of 6/16. The passage from 
measures 35&#8211;42 then forces the listener back into the perception of triple meter 
(3/8). In these measures, Bach composed a sequence that alternates between a 
five-note descending scalar pattern and three groups of two sixteenth notes. 
Each scalar group (see measures 35, 37, 39, and 41) belongs to a single implied 
voice because it contains entirely conjunct motion and is preceded by a large 
interval leap and a change of contour. In the alternating measures, the 
relatively smaller intervals and lack of conjunct motion might prevent stream 
segregation (see the first two beats of measures 36, 38, 40, and 42). But 
principles of voice-leading and motivic repetition would certainly identify two 
voices in each of these measures, one that contains the notes of the three 
strong beats (which create an ascending line) and another containing those on 
the weak beats (which create descending motion and lead to the downbeat of each 
subsequent measure). As a result, this passage provides another example of how 
stream segregation and voice-leading interact to create 
implied polyphony, sometimes identifying the same moments and other times 
highlighting different aspects of the musical structure. </p>
<p>[42] In general, all of 
these different accent patterns and metric possibilities combat the potential 
monotony of isochronous rhythmic patterns. Rather than becoming too comfortable 
with regularly occurring accent patterns that consistently coincide with the 
notated meter, listeners can be engaged by implied voice changes that create 
syncopated inherent rhythms. These inherent rhythms draw attention to the 
fastest level of the metric hierarchy, thereby maintaining the multi-leveled 
metric interest that Bach more explicitly outlined in his truly polyphonic 
compositions. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Conclusion </b> </p>
<p>[43] This research contrasts different approaches to 
analyzing the implied polyphony in Bach&rsquo;s solo string works and emphasizes the 
rhythmic effects of this compositional technique. Although Bach sometimes used 
implied polyphony as an arpeggiation technique that would transform a 
multi-voiced harmonic progression into a single melodic line, as a way to 
disguise or delay the resolution of dissonance, or as something that would 
create underlying voice-leading patterns, he also used implied polyphony to 
preserve a basic attribute of his metric structure. By placing implied voice 
changes on weak beats and with variable frequency, he created a sense of 
multiple voices that applied irregular accent patterns to the surface of these 
pieces. This creates purposeful, engaging, and attention-grabbing activity at 
the fastest level of the metric hierarchy and infuses the isochronous surface 
rhythms with an additional source of structural expression. </p>
<p>[44] Overall, this 
suggests that implied polyphony may not always be synonymous with implied 
contrapuntal voice-leading. There are many monophonic passages where Bach 
created the implication of multiple linear voices that 
could be followed over the course of an entire piece. Likewise, a sense of 
underlying voice-leading can exist in passages that contain no implied polyphony 
at all. Listeners can certainly choose to follow any of these voice-leading 
patterns. But they might also be engaged by phenomenal accents that are created 
as implied voices transition from one to another, thereby creating inherent 
rhythmic patterns that produce the perception of a richer, multi-voiced texture. 
</p>
<p>[45] This analytical approach could also provide an additional explanation for 
the lofty status of these pieces within the string repertoire. In combination 
with the underlying voice-leading, the complexities and variety of other 
structural features, and the immense technical difficulty, implied polyphony 
creates one more source of structural expression in these pieces by providing 
listeners with multiple perceptual possibilities. Albert Bregman commented on 
this while comparing Bach&rsquo;s implied polyphony to the specially constructed 
auditory patterns that he used for studying stream segregation. He suggested 
that the musical examples were more ambiguous than the laboratory examples 
because their intervals are slightly smaller and tempos slightly slower (due 
only to human physical capabilities). He then proposed that &#8220;it is not certain 
that the composers who used this technique would have called for such an 
unambiguous separation of musical lines even if the players could have achieved 
it&rdquo; and concluded with the following statement. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Transitions between high and low 
registers were used by composers of the Baroque period to create compound 
melodic lines&#8212;the impression that a single instrument, such as a violin or 
flute, was playing more than one line of melody at the same time. These 
alternations were not fast enough to cause compulsory segregation of the pitch 
ranges, so the experience was ambiguous between one and two streams. Perhaps 
this was why it was interesting (<a href="#bregman_1990" id="citation_bregman_1990_67e1575a02c97">Bregman 1990</a>, 675&#8211;676). </p>

Although his middleground graph provides information about underlying contrapuntal lines, the content of these inner voices is not consistently determined by those features that are apt to cause stream segregation. Likewise, melodic patterns that clearly imply multiple voices do not necessarily contain the primary voice-leading patterns that Schenker sought to find. For this reason, Schenker&#8217;s analysis of this piece contributes more information about underlying voice-leading patterns than about the creation and perception of multiple voices within a monophonic texture.

Although his middleground graph provides information about underlying contrapuntal lines, the content of these inner voices is not consistently determined by those features that are apt to cause stream segregation. Likewise, melodic patterns that clearly imply multiple voices do not necessarily contain the primary voice-leading patterns that Schenker sought to find. For this reason, Schenker&#8217;s analysis of this piece contributes more information about underlying voice-leading patterns than about the creation and perception of multiple voices within a monophonic texture. Schenker also analyzed two other movements from these pieces (the Sarabande from Cello Suite No. 3 in C major and the Largo from Violin Sonata No. 3 in C major).
