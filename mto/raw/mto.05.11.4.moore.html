<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Some years ago, Simon Frith asked the very obvious question, 
&ldquo;why do songs have words?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> It seems to me that its obverse is equally 
demanding of attention. Not actually &ldquo;why do songs have music?,&rdquo; for that is a 
little too abstract even for my taste, but the associated &ldquo;why do songs have 
accompaniments?&rdquo; Why, when singing, do people (both listeners and performers) 
want or need the security to be gained from having that singing accompanied, 
either by themselves, or by an assortment of others? What does an accompaniment 
<i>add</i>? The word &ldquo;accompany&rdquo; indicates being in the company of something else, 
with an implied hierarchy of perceptual pertinence, although not necessarily of 
significance. What accompanies forms a key part of the environment for what is 
accompanied. Philip Tagg&rsquo;s semiotic method reads this implied relationship 
(between what accompanies and what is accompanied) as the embodiment in music of 
the relationship between an individual and its environment.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> He observes the 
normative underpinning by a melody-accompaniment dualism of all popular song, 
insisting that this textural structure is &ldquo;what Haydn and AC/DC share in 
common,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> and uses Jan Mar&oacute;thy to argue that it is as pervasive a musical 
feature as its visual equivalent, the figure/ground dualism of post-Renaissance 
European painting. So, if accompaniment equates, at first approximation, to 
environment, then melody, in Tagg&rsquo;s understanding, equates to persona. This term 
I actually derive from the writings of Edward T. Cone, particularly <i>The 
Composer&rsquo;s Voice</i>,<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> but I shall depart from him in how I observe the persona 
to be constituted. Indeed, I depart also from Tagg in that for the analysis of 
popular song, it is less the melody which is subject to accompaniment, than the 
result of the activity of singing&mdash;Tagg&rsquo;s work concerns itself only little with 
lyrics. Eric Clarke&rsquo;s adoption of a theory of subject position<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> does concern 
itself with lyrics, and also with accompaniment. He argues that for a song to 
imply a subject position, for it to encourage a listener to prefer one reading 
to others, it must be possible to distinguish analytically between what he terms 
&ldquo;content&rdquo; and &ldquo;technique,&rdquo; such that the &ldquo;technique&rdquo; narrows the 
possible interpretations a listener may make of the &ldquo;content.&rdquo; For Clarke, 
&ldquo;content&rdquo; refers particularly to the realm of the lyrics, while &ldquo;technique&rdquo; in 
principle refers to all other constitutive aspects of a song. Neither Clarke nor 
Tagg use the term &ldquo;persona&rdquo;&mdash;Clarke prefers &ldquo;subject,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> while Tagg uses 
&ldquo;individual.&rdquo; 
Both of these, however, refer to an equivalent identity. I prefer the term 
&ldquo;persona&rdquo; for a number of reasons. Firstly, it reminds us that this identity is 
fictional (and, frequently, it is passive), a characteristic which is not 
brought out by the competing terms. Secondly, it is on occasion multiple 
(particularly when we do not hear only a single voice). Beyond this, it is 
perhaps just a matter of taste.</p>
<p>[2] In defining the potential types of relationship obtaining between persona 
and environment in this article, I adopt a position part-way between those of 
Tagg and Clarke. Both lyric, its manner of articulation, and its shaping melody 
can conspire to create the persona, which is inhabited by the individual (or 
sometimes individuals) who sing to us. The environment within which (or against 
which) that persona operates is represented by the music which accompanies 
her/him, and which therefore includes three distinct elements: </p>
<ul>
	<li>the textural matters normally considered under the heading &ldquo;accompaniment&rdquo;;
	</li>
	<li>the harmonic setting, including the modal/tonal vocabulary;
	</li>
	<li>the formal setting or narrative structure, i.e. the order in which its events 
take place, and the patterns of repetition within this order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of its manifestation in sound, we might properly identify this as the 
<i>personic</i> 
environment. And, to complicate matters further, because as individuals we are 
always part of the environment against which we view others, on occasion the 
melody can, in theory at least, be argued to operate as if it were part of the 
environment rather than the persona. At root, then, this article proposes a 
typology for the relationships enacted in song between a persona and its 
environment, a typology of what an accompaniment may <i>add</i> to a melodic 
line, which it will illustrate through numerous, varied, examples to demonstrate 
not only the ubiquity of the relational positions I identify, but also the way 
that each one is nuanced through its presence in an actual track.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3] The impact an environment can have on the persona can range from the 
significant to the trivial, as accompanimental textures, harmonies and forms 
serve both subtle and blatant functions. Let me dispose of some of the latter 
straight away. The need to orient oneself in terms of precise meter and stable 
pitch is endemic to anglophone popular musics and, probably, to most European
popular music. I am not convinced that the ability to retain meter and pitch is 
normative even amongst highly respected interpreters. Producer Bernard Krause 
wrote of singer Patrice Holloway: &ldquo;So perfect was her pitch [on an unaccompanied 
track] that Paul [Beaver] was able to lay a piano track<nobr> . . . </nobr>some weeks later 
without altering the speed of the tape to change the pitch.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> There would
 have been no need to make such a point were this a more widely exercised skill. 
It therefore seems to me that we can cite the provision of a stable metrical and 
harmonic backdrop as simultaneously the most necessary, most basic, and least 
interesting, purpose of an accompaniment. Whatever else it does, it is almost 
certain to function in this way. Some accompaniments do no more.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Patsy Cline, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue again&rdquo;</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="moore_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="moore_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[4] A related reason is hardly more interesting. Accompaniments 
frequently set the genre of a song, laying out the normative environmental 
conditions, together 
with all the expectation-related baggage that a theory of genre carries.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Thus an adult-oriented rock song, a country song, a punk song, an R&rsquo;n&rsquo;B song, 
are in large part defined by the instrumentation and sound-sources used to  accompany the singer and, in some cases, the style of performance associated 
with those instruments individually or collectively. I am highlighting here a 
crucial distinction between accompaniments which signify only at the level of 
<i>style</i>, and those which signify at the more particularized level of the 
individual <i>song</i>. Examples of the former are legion&mdash;I shall refer to Patsy
 Cline&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue again&rdquo; for its clarity.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> The song is in 32-bar form, in 
<nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>12</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>. In the first half of the verse, the kit and piano have a regular triplet 
pattern, which is broken for bars 17&ndash;24. [See <b>Example 1</b>]. There seems to be no 
particularized expressive content in either this basic groove, or in the change
 of articulation at that point. It simply marks a formal break, the shift to the 
middle 8 section. In saying it has no expressive role, I mean simply that these 
elements could perfectly well be transferred to another song performed by Patsy 
Cline within the same style&mdash;and indeed they are.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> So, in this example, the 
role of the accompanimental environment is simply to situate this song in terms 
of chronology and genre as an example of immediately post-rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll country 
music. Indeed, this also seems to be how accompaniments function for the vast 
majority of solo folk revival singers. The way Martin Carthy attacks the Breton 
pipe tune &ldquo;Ar Ch&rsquo;akouz,&rdquo; which he uses to carry lyrics based on the 
seventeenth-century song &ldquo;The dominion of the sword,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> and the accompaniment 
he gives it, makes musical sense, and expresses his strength of feeling at the 
issues the lyrics address, but contributes not a whit to an interpretation of 
the song. Indeed, beside the vehemence in his voice, the guitar&rsquo;s role is 
relegated to one of setting meter and pitch, identifying genre, and providing an 
image of immovability, in the multiple drone.</p>

<p>[5] Accompanimental textures can also set the attitudinal tone 
of a song, laying out a particular manner of approach to which the singer then 
conforms, as in Bob Dylan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Just like a woman.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The accompanying band has a certain rhythmic 
looseness, most identifiable in very subtle delays of the guitar behind the kit. 
This comes across most typically as relaxed, but it might be read as hedonistic,
 as hippy, or even as sloppy, depending on the listener. Whichever, it could be 
argued to act as a neat metaphor for the falling to pieces of the &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; 
who, with all her insecurities, hides behind the song&rsquo;s title. If the reliance 
on generic convention in &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blue again&rdquo; leads any genre-competent listener to 
expect to hear nothing new in the song, the (relatively) unusual &ldquo;loose&rdquo; 
introduction to &ldquo;Just like a woman&rdquo; will probably create in a genre-competent 
listener an expectation of an idiosyncratic lyric content, and one of a 
potentially personal nature.</p>
<p>[6] In other examples of such tone-setting, the accompaniment can function 
inter-stylistically, to signal that a song will depart somewhat from the style 
normally associated with a particular band.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> The prominent Hammond organ at the beginning of Led Zeppelin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> for example, tells us we are in for an early rock ballad rather than a track in 
blues-rock, or proto-heavy-metal idiom, a promise redeemed by the earnestness of 
Robert Plant&rsquo;s expressions of constancy. In Roy Harper&rsquo;s &ldquo;When an old cricketer 
leaves the crease,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> the function of the accompanimental silver band is rather more specific: it 
encourages a culturally-competent listener to hear the song as nostalgic, in its 
evocation of a no longer communal, rural English, late summer twilight, echoing 
the familiar conceit equating the passage of a year to the course of a life.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>[7] So, the function of tone-setting acts to prepare the listener for how to 
respond to the style, probably from the outset of a song. As far as this 
function is concerned, the accompaniment will not necessarily intervene 
thereafter in the expressive meaning of the song. Recall that this is what the
 majority of accompaniments simply do.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> And it is here, we may suppose, that a large number of listeners switch off. It 
seems to me that all will be, on some level, aware of these lower levels of 
functionality of accompaniments. However, to note the functions which follow, 
active listening is probably required. Other than this simple distinction, I am 
not suggesting that the functions I outline are hierarchically related in terms 
of &ldquo;importance&rdquo;&mdash;what is important for a listener is for that listener to 
determine. However, a degree of active listening is required in order to answer 
the question I set at the opening of this article.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

<p>[8] But as with so many expressive features, we become alert to them when faced 
with their subversion (indeed, my comments regarding &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; could be seen 
as an unproblematic example of this). The track &ldquo;&lsquo;T smidje,&rdquo; by Flemish vocal 
trio La&iuml;s,<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> begins with 
the sort of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>6</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> clod-hopping accompaniment which was the bane of &lsquo;70s folk rock 
[see <b>Example 2a</b>]&mdash;examples like Fairport Convention&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lark in the morning&rdquo; come to mind.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
However, as soon as the vocals enter, with what is initially an offbeat 
subsidiary figure [<b>Example 2b</b>], doubts are raised as to the provenance of the 
accompaniment. I would suggest that, by the time the exquisite upper dominant 
pedal, in the voice, makes itself felt in the second half of the verse, over the 
increased rate of harmonic movement there [<b>Example 2c</b>], 
we have been lifted well out of the putative world of the introduction. The fact 
that the vast majority of listeners to this track will not understand the 
(Flemish) lyrics does not obscure the way the texture overcomes its initial 
hindrance. (In any case, Kadril, the band who accompany La&iuml;s on this track, 
acknowledge Fairport Convention unproblematically within their heritage.) In 
these examples, then, the accompanimental texture gives us information about how 
to situate a particular track against its stylistic background, but without 
necessarily relating to the signification of the song as represented by the 
lyric.</p>

<p>[9] With this function, we begin to tread interesting ground. We begin to 
approach that realm where some attention to the <i>detail</i> of the personic 
environment is necessary in order to apprehend the expressive richness of the 
virtual performances of particular personae. Here we have the received view of 
the role of an accompaniment, which is to conform to the ostensible meaning of 
the lyrics and, in doing so, to support, or perhaps illustrate, the meaning of 
the song. Forms of word-painting are the most obvious devices here, but within 
popular music, we must be wary of seeking the sort of notationally-based 
word-painting techniques familiar from notated music. In a recorded genre, 
word-painting works by reference to the sounds heard, not to their visual 
representation. Iggy Pop&rsquo;s recent song &ldquo;Whatever&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> exemplifies this clearly. 
The song originates on a lacklustre album, and is ironic in its consistent 
recourse to the kind of adolescent disdain indicated by the title (Iggy Pop was 
born in 1947). The stylistically conventional overdriven guitar which forms part 
of the accompaniment simply drops from the texture on the words &ldquo;her voice just 
fades away.&rdquo; It is not a true fade, but the parallel is strong enough&mdash;by 
dropping away, the texture literally illustrates the content of, actually 
energizes, the lyric. Indeed, the very obviousness of the device adds to the 
rather tongue-in-cheek subject position the song adopts. An analogous, although 
not ironic, situation can be found in Joe Cocker&rsquo;s cover of &ldquo;With a little help 
from my friends.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> As in the Beatles&rsquo; original, the backing voices change 
position during the song from being simply respondents, to actively questioning 
the persona&rsquo;s need for reassurance from others. But, deviating from the 
original, in the second bridge (at about 3&rsquo;46&rdquo;), the support these &ldquo;friends&rdquo; 
offer becomes so psychologically strong that Cocker no longer needs to sing the 
lyrics his listeners would have known from the Beatles&rsquo; version. The &ldquo;help&rdquo; 
offered by the accompanimental, female, singers here becomes palpable. The key 
feature of the environment in which Cocker is singing is formed by these 
confidantes. A similar degree of accompanimental support is offered to John 
Lennon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Imagine&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> by the production qualities particularly of Lennon&rsquo;s 
accompanying piano. Here, the sonically unfocused quality of the production of 
the instrument&rsquo;s sound supports a similar fuzziness in the singer&rsquo;s ideology, 
which has contributed to the debates about both the degree of realism, and the 
self-delusion, which may surround Lennon&rsquo;s song.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> This quality is enhanced by 
the observation that the melodic line first achieves a measure of 
harmonically-supported closure on the word &ldquo;dreamer.&rdquo; And we don&rsquo;t have to wait 
for the rise of rock to find such examples. Nat King Cole&rsquo;s performances of 
&ldquo;When I fall in love&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> spend most of their course promising how he will 
behave when that eventuality comes about. Unexceptionally, the song matches 
turns to the minor with recollections of sadness but, at the last, as his 
falling in love becomes directed (&ldquo;when I fall in love<nobr> . . . </nobr>with you&rdquo;), the final 
&ldquo;you&rdquo; is marked by an unexpected chromaticism. Here, it is not the 
accompanimental textures, but the harmonic environment, which supports the 
lyric.</p>
<p>[10] A rather different example appears in the Yes song &ldquo;Heart of the 
sunrise.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> According to the lyrics printed in the sleeve, the word 
&ldquo;sharp&rdquo; is 
clearly marked for attention, being capitalized. Almost without exception, each 
appearance of the word is immediately followed by a &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; sound, i.e. one with 
a notably crisper attack than its surrounding sounds&mdash;on its second appearance 
(at 4&rsquo;26&rdquo;) by a most pointed kick drum, at its third (at 5&rsquo;43&rdquo;) by the entire 
band. Indeed, by enacting the lyric, this example seems closer to what I would 
describe as &ldquo;amplifying&rdquo; the meaning, rather than simply &ldquo;supporting&rdquo; it, 
suggesting that &ldquo;supporting&rdquo; and &ldquo;amplifying&rdquo; be seen as two stages on a 
continuum.</p>
<p>[11] Enactment of a lyric will often take place by means of a track&rsquo;s form. The 
lack of final closure embodied in Janis Joplin&rsquo;s live performance of &ldquo;Ball and 
chain&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> serves to prevent the listener from treating the performance as 
simply a performance of the song. Here, the accompanying musicians vanish (in 
the actual performance, they most likely left the stage) while Joplin delivers 
an extempore solo but, in a departure from contemporary practice, they fail to 
return to round off the song. This solo serves to enact the lyrics by blurring 
the boundary between a (fictionalized) performance and a diatribe on the nature 
of contemporary society. In Sonny and Cher&rsquo;s love song &ldquo;I got you babe,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> the 
&ldquo;us against the world&rdquo; position which the lyrics promote is maintained musically 
by a monotone <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> over I&ndash;IV&ndash;I&mdash;the sense is of maintaining the melodic pitch 
(and thus their stance) &ldquo;in spite of&rdquo; the shift to a dissonant IV. After a 
series of verses/choruses (none of which comes to rest on I), a final playout 
continues, before fading, over a I&ndash;IV&ndash;I&ndash;V&ndash;(I&ndash;IV&ndash;I&ndash;V<nobr> . . . </nobr>) pattern. This is the 
first time in the song that I is approached directly from a strong V, rather 
than from IV or an imperfect cadence. And, for the first time, the emphasis in 
the relationship changes, from &ldquo;I got <i>you</i>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<i>I</i> got you.&rdquo; This change, 
formally specific, is thus enacted in the harmony. A more complex example 
appears in Ashford &amp; Simpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no mountain high enough,&rdquo; as sung by Diana 
Ross.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> The track opens with a wordless chorus, an entreating verse (&ldquo;if you 
need me<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;) and a second chorus. We continue with what sounds like a bridge, 
marked by an ascending bass (a topic indicating &ldquo;reaching&rdquo;) which leads to a 
climax at which point the singer gives her lover what she insists is her 
guarantee that she will always be there. We return to the chorus. Having a 
single verse, and a bridge which marks a change of relational position, is 
highly unusual. The transgressive nature of the form, marked by the chromatic 
bass, thus supports the lyrics. These examples, in moving from uncertainty to 
certainty, also flout the norm whereby most popular songs explore a static 
position. Analogously, Cilla Black&rsquo;s singing of the Bacharach/David classic &ldquo;Alfie&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> 
subverts expectations of the form of the song. In the first two verses, the 
singer is bemused by her lover &ldquo;Alfie&rdquo; (she always stresses the 
first syllable of the name) who holds it &ldquo;wise to be cruel.&rdquo; At the beginning of 
the third verse, after a bridge which threatens to challenge the harmonic world 
of the opening, her enquiries become an assertion: &ldquo;I believe in love.&rdquo; A 
chromatic bass then moves us into a formally new area, where she insists that 
&ldquo;without true love we just exist, Alfie,&rdquo; stressing for the first time the 
last syllable of his name. This alteration marks a change in her emotional 
position&mdash;her self-discovery coincides with both a shift in harmonic language 
and transgression of normal formal practice&mdash;in this way harmony and form work 
together to mark her moment of self-awareness.</p>
<p>[12] Three further examples will demonstrate the variety of ways simple 
accompanimental textures are involved in such enactment. Bj&ouml;rk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Army of 
me&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> overturns established gender stereotypes in angrily addressing a weak 
partner&mdash;the absence of a harmonic filler layer within the texture<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> (i.e. 
the sparsity of the accompanimental strands) removes an element which serves to 
distance the listener, making palpable the menace expressed. The Beach Boys&rsquo; 
&ldquo;God only knows&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> leaves the answer to &ldquo;what I&rsquo;d be without you&rdquo; unanswered 
in the lyric. However, the song&rsquo;s conclusion provides an answer, in the 
three-part quasi-quodlibet, which literally enacts the breaking up that the 
persona  would otherwise endure. In a final example, the persona&rsquo;s environment is formed 
by a combination of form and accompaniment, but which seems to go beyond both&mdash;this environment for the song 
&ldquo;John Gaudie,&rdquo; by English folk revivalists 
Whippersnapper,<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> clearly &ldquo;amplifies&rdquo; the signification&mdash;it makes it larger, 
sets it on a wider stage. The song concerns our John who breaks out of gaol to 
go off and write a fiddle tune, which the band then go on to play. We might 
assume the song to be traditional, and the subsequent tune newly invented. In 
fact, what happens is a reversal of this&mdash;the final tune is traditional, while 
the song itself is credited to fiddler Chris Leslie. This variety of examples 
attests to the wide presence of this function.</p>
<p>[13] So, we move from simply supporting the meaning of the song, to amplifying 
it, to providing more information than is present in the lyric. There are other 
ways of amplifying the song&rsquo;s meaning than this. One concerns lyrics of 
ambiguous meaning. The issue of ambiguity is problematic because, with many 
songs, ambiguity is only the result of unfamiliarity with idiom, and is thus  dependent on the nature of listeners&rsquo; competence. Traffic&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Hole in my 
shoe,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> though, provides a case which may be more universally valid. It 
causes trouble to anyone who simply tries to interpret the lyrics at face value&mdash;&ldquo;an elephant&rsquo;s eye was looking at me from a bubblegum tree&rdquo; for instance. 
 The accompanimental texture, however, situates the song very clearly within the 
psychedelic movement, indicating that the lyrics are not to be taken at face 
value, that the environment is not a realist one. Thus the &ldquo;100 tin soldiers&rdquo; do 
not literally &ldquo;stand at my shoulder.&rdquo; Indeed, the prominent psychedelic 
coding<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> may even imply that the texture, rather than the lyric itself, may be 
the prime carrier of meaning. This coding is provided primarily by 
instrumentation (sitar, flute, mellotron) and production techniques (slow chord 
bending, reverse recording, phasing). Thus we are reassured that the song&rsquo;s 
ambiguity is inherent, and is not a feature of our possible lack of competence. 
In this way its meaning is clarified.</p>
<p>[14] Meaning is also amplified when an environment provides information more 
deeply encoded than that of the lyrics, most particularly by its harmonic 
underpinning, for harmonic setting often implies very particular readings of 
lyrics. Simple examples are provided by Slade&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coz I luv you&rdquo; and by Jimi 
Hendrix&rsquo; &ldquo;Hey Joe.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> Both songs concern troublesome interpersonal 
relationships and both are set to open-ended harmonic loops. It is the circular 
nature of these which illuminates the obsessive nature of both songs, something 
which is not fully explicit in the lyrics themselves. On &ldquo;The way that it 
shows,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> Richard Thompson uses harmony to amplify the similar disintegration 
of a relationship, below the surface, in the obsessive repetition of the 
sequence Dm&ndash;Bm&ndash;Gm&ndash;E. A sensible sequence in terms of root motion becomes 
nonsensical (in relation to assumptions about harmonic norms in his repertoire) 
through its chromaticisms.</p>
<p>[15] A slightly more complex example is the Beach Boys&rsquo; well-known hit 
&ldquo;Good 
vibrations.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> The  song opens with a stepwise descent from Em, repeated, before shifting to the 
relative major for the chorus. The singer sings of being in receipt of &ldquo;good 
vibrations,&rdquo; over a pattern which moves upward, from G, to A, to B in readiness 
for the second verse. The vector is clear&mdash;upward motion, and activity in the 
relationship by his partner, towards him. In the centre of the song, the texture 
slims remarkably, down to organ and shakers, over which the singer begins to 
recognize his culpability&mdash;he&rsquo;s &ldquo;gotta keep those<nobr> . . . </nobr>vibrations happening with 
her,&rdquo; i.e. become active himself. Thereafter, the  &ldquo;good vibrations&rdquo; hook is sung over the same pattern, but now in reverse motion, 
from B, to A, to G. Having thus become active in the relationship, a new, 
smoother, coda melody is brought in, repeated from G, A, B and finally A, 
finishing mid-way between the outer reaches of this motion. It thus symbolizes 
the ensuing success of the relationship, resultant from the &ldquo;emotional work&rdquo; the 
singer has implicitly agreed to undertake.</p>
<p>[16] I wrote at the outset that harmonic setting can be vital in its 
representation of the environment. How, though, to read this? The cornerstone of 
my understanding equates achievement of I with closure in some sense, and 
failure to achieve it with lack of closure, modified as necessary by metrical 
placing. The other key characteristic is the observation that as a mode 
increases the number of minor intervals above the tonic (as we move from Lydian 
through to Locrian), the greater the degree of negative emotional quality 
invested in the environment. This hermeneutic construct is yet to be empirically 
tested. Deep Purple&rsquo;s &ldquo;Child in Time&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> is one of a body of songs reliant for 
its effect on the Aeolian cadence. This is the cadential pattern moving VI&ndash;VII&ndash;i 
(i.e. F&ndash;G&ndash;Am in a Aeolian). This cadence<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> in rock is, more often than not, 
associated with achievement in the face of high odds, what I call its 
&ldquo;nonetheless&rdquo; quality. This is the realm of its signification. The underlying 
pattern to &ldquo;Child in Time&rdquo; is formed of i&ndash;VII&ndash;i; VI&ndash;VII; VII&ndash;i. The impending, 
and ultimately realized, disaster apparent in the lyrics is matched by this 
constant reiteration, demonstrating an undesired actualization of the inevitable
 outcome. This sense of the inevitability of an unwanted outcome is crucial to 
understanding the Coverdale Page track &ldquo;Take me for a little while.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> The 
verse begins by decorating harmonies of E, moves to a pattern dominated by Am, 
but then sinks back. A short pre-chorus reiterates the importance of Am, such 
that the chorus takes up the sequence Am&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;G. Failure to resolve to chord I, 
in this example to resolve to Am at the end of the Am&ndash;F&ndash;G&ndash;G pattern, implies the 
subversion of an inevitable outcome. Now the subject matter of the song&rsquo;s lyric 
concerns the inevitability of failure&mdash;at the crucial moment, the singer tells 
his lover to take him just &ldquo;for a little while.&rdquo; Their relationship cannot 
remain stable, because he&rsquo;s &ldquo;growing older.&rdquo; The harmony, in other words,
 indicates that &ldquo;taking him for a little while&rdquo; is an attempt to subvert the 
inevitable, i.e. the inevitability of failure, a failure&mdash;his demise&mdash;which 
will come about once the final chord I is reached and closure is achieved. For 
this reason, the track fades without that happening. The Darkness track &ldquo;Holding 
my own&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> uses the same pattern to energize an avoidance of the inevitable. It 
is less marked: the parallel Am&ndash;G&ndash;F&ndash;G chord sequence accompanies the song&rsquo;s 
title, asserting that the persona is &ldquo;holding his own&rdquo; in the face of enormous 
odds; because it is less marked, the sequence functions harmonically as Ionian 
vi&ndash;V&ndash;IV&ndash;V rather than Aeolian i&ndash;VII&ndash;VI&ndash;VII. The realm of its signification is 
nonetheless the same.</p>

<p>[17] We can move further, I&rsquo;m convinced, from support, through amplification, to 
explanation: the harmonic underpinning to the Rolling Stones&rsquo; &ldquo;Satisfaction&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup> explains the state Mick Jagger describes. This is a constant state, one of being 
unable to achieve satisfaction, to achieve closure. Musically, closure is 
unattainable here because the constant repeated sequence of the open-ended  verse is simply a 
Mixolydian I&ndash;IV&ndash; the I is so familiar that the closure 
otherwise attendant on achieving it, is impossible here. The melody, too, is 
insistent upon its reiterated tonics. No wonder he can&rsquo;t get no satisfaction&mdash;he has nowhere else to go. From a very different genre, Vanessa Carlton&rsquo;s  
&ldquo;Ordinary Day&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> uses harmony and texture to explain the lyric. The song 
concerns an encounter with first love, energized from the outset by Carlton&rsquo;s 
breathy delivery and an insecure bass which consistently sounds the tonic third 
rather than the root, providing a picture of (pleasant) insecurity or 
anticipation. [See <b>Example 3a</b>] After two verses, at 1&rsquo;46&ldquo;, the imaginary 
&rdquo;ordinary boy&ldquo; is providing security (she&rsquo;s &rdquo;in the palm of your hand&ldquo;) as the 
tonic achieves its root [<b>Example 3b</b>]. To mark this coming together, at 2&rsquo;1&rdquo;, the 
two independent parts move in both rhythmic and partial melodic unison [<b>Example 3c</b>]. 
Subsequently she comes out of what was &ldquo;just a dream&rdquo; and we move back to 
separation and insecurity marked by absence of the harmonic root. However, as 
she recalls the experience out of the dream world, at 3&rsquo;20&rdquo;, she recovers her 
security. The song thus provides a model of a girl overcoming insecurity through 
learning to trust a &ldquo;significant other,&rdquo; dramatized by the difference between 
&ldquo;dream&rdquo; and &ldquo;reality&rdquo; and the transfer of something understood while in the 
&ldquo;dream&rdquo; state into reality. This model cannot be inferred form the lyrics alone, 
but requires close attention to both the texture and harmonies of her 
accompaniment.</p>

<p>[18] In suggesting that an environment may explain the actions of a persona, I 
return briefly to Clarke&rsquo;s work on subject position. Translating into the terms 
I am using in this article, he suggests that certain songs, through the detail 
of their environments, limit the potential range of listener responses to the 
issues presented by the persona. Provided we go no further than &ldquo;limit,&rdquo; and not 
as far as &ldquo;prescribe,&rdquo; I find this a pretty persuasive argument. He notably 
focuses on P.J.Harvey and John Parish&rsquo;s &ldquo;Taut,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> a song which, he argues, 
&ldquo;draws the listener in to a close identification with the singer and 
protagonist, a rather direct confrontation with that potent mixture of 
infatuation and terrified submission that can turn people into victims.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup> He 
demonstrates this most particularly through close attention to the song&rsquo;s 
introduction, its combination of particular sounds, their predictability and 
their connotations, and the way these set up the lyric. In other words, the  introduction indicates how we might experience the lyric, once it arrives. 
However, that said, I would argue that a subject position can become possible 
even without explicit understanding of the &ldquo;content,&rdquo; the lyric. Take the Tri Yann 
song &ldquo;Je m&rsquo;en vas,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> &ldquo;I set off.&rdquo; The melody to this track is borrowed 
from the old folk song &ldquo;The leaving of Liverpool.&rdquo; In the hands of revivalist 
groups like the Dubliners or the Spinners, this is a very ordinary song.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> And 
Tri Yann&rsquo;s version starts very much in that vein, as if performed by an 
unsophisticated musician. We are encouraged to hear it as an inconsequential, 
anachronistic, amateur performance. But the textural growth which maps the 
track&rsquo;s narrative, the staged addition of tight rhythm section, overdriven 
guitar and prominent pipes, totally changes it for a Celticist audience, at 
least. This developing texture implies a sense of determination wholly missing 
from older performances, although both the original song, and Tri Yann&rsquo;s, are 
about leaving on a long journey. Thus Tri Yann envelop us in the journey.</p>
<p>[19] However, it is not only the listener who can be disposed to take up a 
particular reading of a song. In some instances, the persona represented by the 
singer can be predisposed to take up a particular reading, with that 
predisposition being apparent to the listener. In this sort of case, the  environment is partially described, as I have suggested already for Joe Cocker&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;With a little help from my friends,&rdquo; as the singer&rsquo;s confidante. It effectively 
provides advice to the persona inhabited by the singer, about how to act in 
response to the situation which is the subject of the song. A comparison of two 
tracks will demonstrate how subtle the effect of the accompaniment can be. 
Indeed, one obvious area of development for the theory I outline here would be a 
comparison of the range of different types of alternative versions (pastiches, 
copies, covers, unplugged performances etc.) which exist, observing the changing 
interplay between persona and environment.</p>

<p>[20] In her performance of the soul classic 
&ldquo;Stay with me (baby),&rdquo; Lorraine 
Ellison seems almost unconcerned for herself. She is simply pleading for the 
continuance of a relationship. She needs to deliver the lyrics with such force, 
though, that we might be moved to ask whether such a continuation is in her own 
best interests. She points out in the song that she has always been around for &ldquo;him,&rdquo; she has proved her devotion, which she now desperately implores him to 
reciprocate. The key moment occurs in the chorus, with the way the accompaniment 
operates. The <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>12</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> feel, with pronounced upbeat, seems to push the song forward 
rather roughly. The rallentando of the previous bar is very localized, and the 
chorus picks up with quite a lilt. The difference between this feel, and that of 
the comparable portion of Bette Midler&rsquo;s later, live performance, is 
striking.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup> Midler is performing even further over the top than did Ellison. 
The accompaniment then drags Midler&rsquo;s &ldquo;cries,&rdquo; giving her space to fully indulge 
herself. In the chorus, in opposition to Ellison&rsquo;s version, the accompaniment 
(most particularly the bass and kit) provides constant movement throughout the 
second half of the bar, a feel which is much closer to <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>6</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> that <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>12</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>. This seems 
to support her plea for the continuation of a static situation [compare <b>Examples 4a 
and 4b</b>]. In Bette Midler&rsquo;s performance, then, the music is not pushed forward. 
It seems to me that for Lorraine Ellison, the accompanimental environment, which 
is acting as her confidante, is saying &ldquo;move to the future,&rdquo; which will be a 
better situation for her, since staying with &ldquo;him&rdquo; will result in a difficult 
relationship. For Bette Midler, again acting as her confidante, the 
accompaniment, in indulging her, is saying &ldquo;stay with it,&rdquo; &ldquo;stay with him,&rdquo; &ldquo;stay with the situation,&rdquo; oblivious to the difficulties which a good confidante 
should foresee.</p>

<p>[21] What happens here, then, is that the environment provides us with 
information which is over and above what we get not only from the lyrics, but 
from the singer too. Indeed, it implies different readings of different 
performances, confirmation that the signification of a song cannot lie in the 
song, but must lie in the way the performance is received. Moreover, it is 
information which the singer is probably only party to if she is sufficiently 
aware (we can only guess whether the &ldquo;Lorraine Ellison&rdquo; persona will actually 
heed the accompaniment&rsquo;s advice). An analogy I have in mind here is that of the 
everyday understanding of &ldquo;body language.&rdquo; When watching others speak, we can 
tell how committed they are to what they are saying, we can tell whether to risk 
trusting in them, by how they express themselves, how they accompany their words 
with posture and gesture. Simon Frith has argued that even without visual clues, 
we can discern whether to trust singers by listening to the non-singing sounds 
they make: &ldquo;Pop songs celebrate not the articulate but the inarticulate, and the 
evaluation of pop singers depends not on words but on sounds&mdash;on the noises 
around the words. In daily life, the most directly intense statements of feeling 
involve just such noises: people gasp, moan, laugh, cry<nobr> . . . </nobr>people distrust the 
silver-tongued, the seducers, politicians, salesmen, who&rsquo;ve got the gift of the 
gab. Inarticulateness, not poetry, is the popular songwriter&rsquo;s conventional sign 
of sincerity.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> I would argue that this discernment stretches not just to the 
inarticulate sound singers make, but to the non-articulating sounds which go to 
make up a performance, i.e. the sounds of accompanying instruments. A very 
different example of the same process, of the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of a situation being 
available to the perception of an audience but not to the persona, is given by 
the Beach Boys&rsquo; &ldquo;Surfin&rsquo; USA.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup> This is an example of a different order, 
since the song is based, both harmonically and melodically, on Chuck Berry&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Sweet little sixteen.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> There is little doubt that, when writing the Beach
 Boys&rsquo; song, Brian Wilson was aware of the similarity (the song is nowadays 
credited to &ldquo;C.Berry/B.Wilson&rdquo;) but the change of location, and the brash 
innocence in which it is sung, imply that the Beach Boys personae are unaware of 
a link contemporary listeners inevitably made.</p>
<p>[22] Philip Tagg, in his lengthy deconstruction of the Abba hit 
&ldquo;Fernando,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup> argues that certain features of that song&mdash;melodic intervals, instrumental 
setting&mdash;warn us not to trust the singer&rsquo;s expression of commitment to the 
&ldquo;revolutionary cause,&rdquo; nostalgic reflection on which is the subject of the song. 
In such a case, where the persona and the environment are at odds, we are urged 
to trust the latter, in the same way that we would trust body language over 
direct speech. This example is by no means alone. Andy Stewart&rsquo;s self-penned &ldquo;Donald, where&rsquo;s your troosers?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> is normally taken as a piece of nostalgic 
whimsy. The song sets up three positions, those of the Scottish yokel (who 
always wears a kilt), of polite (Edinburgh?) society, and (more hidden) of the 
(BBC) establishment of which Stewart was himself a part. Polite society is 
lampooned, and the yokel seems to come off best. However, the expressed distaste 
of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll (the recording of the song itself contains a delightful pastiche 
of Elvis Presley singing it) is voiced on the part of the establishment. The 
song is harmonically accompanied by a &ldquo;double tonic&rdquo; (i.e. Aeolian i&ndash;VII) 
pattern, which sounds authentically &ldquo;Scottish.&rdquo; However, the end of each verse 
replaces the &ldquo;expected&rdquo; VII&ndash;i cadence with the V&ndash;i of the concert hall&mdash;a 
subtle, but nonetheless forceful, trouncing of the Scottish vernacular with that 
of high culture. The harmonic environment, then, if we can hear it, tells us not 
to take the lyrics at face value. In the Boomtown Rats&rsquo; &ldquo;I never loved Eva 
Braun,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup> the protagonist is more obviously culpable. He (who can only be 
identified as Adolf Hitler) brazenly declares that he wasn&rsquo;t responsible for the
 results of his actions, but the breakdown and nonchalant whistling (of the sort 
you might have indulged in as a kid, hands behind your back, head in the air as 
your misdemeanor is discovered&mdash;Who? Me?)<sup><a name="FN59REF" href="#FN59" id="footnote59">(59)</a></sup> which precede the final chorus 
(at c.3&rsquo;15&rdquo;) give the lie to that. And there are other types of example too. The 
position set up by the Sex Pistols&rsquo; &ldquo;Holidays in the Sun&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN60REF" href="#FN60" id="footnote60">(60)</a></sup> is also not to be
 believed. Here is a song which purports to anarchism, a line totally belied by 
its formulaic rhythmic, harmonic, and articulative approach.<sup><a name="FN61REF" href="#FN61" id="footnote61">(61)</a></sup> A final example 
is rather bizarre but, I think, particularly informative. I refer to a 
re-recording by &lsquo;60s balladeers the Bachelors of the Hollies&rsquo; 1969 hit &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t
 heavy.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN62REF" href="#FN62" id="footnote62">(62)</a></sup> This is a song which wears it&rsquo;s heart on its sleeve, inspired by a 
line from the 1938 film <i>Boys Town</i>, symbolizing comradeship among vagrant boys, 
and supposedly based on reality. It is a difficult song to bring off, requiring 
grandeur without pomposity, compassion without sentimentality. This Bachelors&rsquo; 
recent version aims for a big ending, presumably demonstrating the care the 
singer promises, and his disdain for the cost entailed. In order to bring it 
off, however, the drummer hopelessly miscalculates his cadential flurry in a 
rhetorical display empty of content. There may be a risk of overstating the case 
out of context, so a comparison is in order. In Grandaddy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hewlett&rsquo;s  Daughter,&rdquo; we can hear the same sort of over-blown, contextually inappropriate 
drum intervention. However, because this occurs at the end of the bridge between 
verses, &ldquo;out of the blue,&rdquo; rather than at the end of the song, its 
inappropriateness seems intentional. It seems to be in the service of the anger 
that is just below the surface of the singer&rsquo;s declaration that he &ldquo;should have 
been your son.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN63REF" href="#FN63" id="footnote63">(63)</a></sup> There is no equivalent inappropriateness of position within 
the form of the song in the Bachelors&rsquo; case.</p>
<p>[23] So, we can declare that the environment sometimes suggests to the listener 
to occupy a subject position which disbelieves the persona, reminding us that 
all may not be as it seems. This I relate to one part of a schema put forward 
recently by Nicholas Cook, who identifies what he calls modes of media 
pairing<sup><a name="FN64REF" href="#FN64" id="footnote64">(64)</a></sup>&mdash;the relationships obtaining between separate media in an artwork. 
His theoretical model is provided by the Lakoff and Johnson discussion of 
metaphors and, since metaphor is manifested within a single medium, i.e. within 
the utterance, it seems reasonable to use his terminology for a single medium 
(if we insist that persona and environment, notwithstanding the recourse of the 
former to words, actually constitute a single medium). Cook argues that two 
concurrent media can inhabit one of three relationships: conformity, 
complementation, and contest. In the recent examples, above, the views given by 
the two textural strands (persona/melody and environment/accompaniment) contest 
each other, and in such cases I think we are always more likely to trust the 
latter. Perhaps because the accompaniment is wordless and therefore not possibly 
subject to Frith&rsquo;s &ldquo;silver tongue,&rdquo; the analogy with &ldquo;body language&rdquo; seems to me 
quite fruitful.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b>. Jethro Tull, &ldquo;Flyingdale flyer&rdquo; from 29&rdquo;</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="moore_examples.php?id=9&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 5 thumbnail" src="moore_ex5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>


<p>[24] Hitherto, my attention has been focused on the way that the environment may 
modify our conception of the persona. The environment has always been secondary. 
What, though, if the two appear more equal? After all, we are all perceived by 
others as actors within an environment, as well as perceiving ourselves as 
acting upon it. The second of Cook&rsquo;s terms describes the situation where the two 
elements are in an equal, complementary, relationship. The verb to &ldquo;accompany&rdquo; 
implies an hierarchical relationship; it suggests that what is accompanied has a 
greater role in the identification of what is going on, in the sense of giving 
identity to it. In complementation, though, this hierarchical relationship comes 
into question, potentially resulting in an ecologically more sound relationship. 
The hierarchy may survive, if only because of the distinction between lyric and 
not-lyric, but it may be somewhat tenuous. In the verse of Jethro Tull&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fylingdale flyer,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN65REF" href="#FN65" id="footnote65">(65)</a></sup> the rhythmic profile of the accompaniment is unitary, 
and constantly rubs against that of the parallel multi-tracked voice. The  relationship here is complementary, akin to that of a couple ballroom dancing, 
where one (the melody) leads, but leads only because of the presence of the 
lyrics [<b>Example 5</b>].</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>. Carpenters, &ldquo;Goodbye to Love&rdquo;</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="moore_examples.php?id=10&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 6 thumbnail" src="moore_ex6_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[25] I come now to two final instances where, again, the simple identification 
of accompaniment is problematized. In the Jethro Tull example, although there 
are two identifiable strands, the relationship between them is complementary. 
Within this broad repertoire of song, can we always posit two strands, can we 
always distinguish between a persona and its environment (the latter identified 
as accompanimental)? I think so, but sometimes the voice is far less prominent 
than we might normally expect. This can happen in terms of production values, as 
in much of the Rolling Stones&rsquo; early material, where what is presented to us is 
not so much an accompanied lead singer, but almost a communal effort, one facet 
of which happens to be vocal.<sup><a name="FN66REF" href="#FN66" id="footnote66">(66)</a></sup> Even here, though, I think the voice 
perceptually dominates simply because of the presence of the verbal strand. A 
very good test of this position is provided by the very end of King Crimson&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Larks&rsquo; Tongues in Aspic, Part One&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN67REF" href="#FN67" id="footnote67">(67)</a></sup> in which instrumental interplay covers 
what appears to be a heated argument. This is in the distance, and the words 
cannot be made out, and yet by the fact that they are words, they call for our 
attention. A more common case occurs where a vocal line gets taken over by part 
of the accompaniment. This is common in examples of &ldquo;call and response&rdquo; textures 
as they develop from African-American genres.<sup><a name="FN68REF" href="#FN68" id="footnote68">(68)</a></sup> It also happens in mainstream 
rock and pop, as in Wishbone Ash&rsquo;s &ldquo;Throw down the sword,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN69REF" href="#FN69" id="footnote69">(69)</a></sup> where a 
bifurcated melody leads into a two-part guitar line. Indeed, perhaps this is  potentially what always happens when a solo enters: if we read this solo as a 
continuation of the vocal melody, at the point of interchange, the expression 
can be seen as becoming more eloquent, as it moves beyond words. The Carpenters&rsquo; 
&ldquo;Goodbye to love&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN70REF" href="#FN70" id="footnote70">(70)</a></sup> 
exemplifies this more overtly, as the guitar solo actually picks up Karen 
Carpenter&rsquo;s phrasing and literally takes her expression up to new heights [See 
<b>Example 6</b>]. Notwithstanding the fact that Carpenters fans disliked the 
intrusion of the guitar as stylistically foreign,<sup><a name="FN71REF" href="#FN71" id="footnote71">(71)</a></sup> this reading is certainly 
available to non-fans. There seems to me a clear difference between this sort of 
case, where a melody line moves to an instrument for a solo, and the sharing of 
material between two forces, simply because in this former case, the melody is 
firmly identified with the persona before the instrument ever gets near it.</p>

<p>[26] Finally, an obvious question which I have left till last. Is it right to 
call all the non-melodic parts of a texture &ldquo;accompaniment&rdquo;? In other words, is 
Tagg&rsquo;s assumption of a melody/accompaniment dualism sufficient? This is actually 
too large a (new) question for me to more than broach here, but some coverage is 
necessary. As an assumption, it appears a reasonable one, but there is certainly 
one significant repertoire where it falls down. This repertoire is formed by 
instances where, along with a band, the persona of the singer self-accompanies 
him- or herself on a guitar (self-accompaniment on a keyboard is a different 
issue, I believe). On Lindisfarne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good to be here,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN72REF" href="#FN72" id="footnote72">(72)</a></sup> we simply hear singer 
Alan Hull, an acoustic guitar (which Hull plays), and an orchestra. The 
orchestra forms an accompanimental environment which really only supports the 
persona from the outset, reacting expressively at the &ldquo;right&rdquo; points. The guitar 
is sounded in conjunction with the orchestra, such that its role seems to be 
accompanimental. However, at the moment at which the singer becomes no longer 
separated from what he&rsquo;s describing, the moment when he wakes from what we come 
to realize is a dream of a ghostly nature, when he comes to describe his wife
 addressing him in bed, the guitar drops from the texture. It is away only 
momentarily, but its absence clearly marks that moment of change. If only at 
this point, the guitar function is clearly separate from that of the remainder 
of the accompaniment, which does not mark this moment. This usage develops from 
the singer/songwriter genre, and was taken up by heavy rock in the late 
1960s/early 1970s where the guitar, when pitted against the rest of the 
accompaniment, represents the individual battling against some sort of societal 
norm, or a body of undifferentiated &ldquo;others.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN73REF" href="#FN73" id="footnote73">(73)</a></sup> As this example demonstrates, 
in this repertoire, the guitar might more usefully be read as part of the 
persona.</p>
<p>[27] So, it seems to me that the function of accompaniments is far from unitary, 
as their textures, harmonies and forms create environments within which a 
persona acts. I have isolated seven stages on a continuum, from simple 
pitch/meter orientation, through genre-setting and tone-setting, to support, 
amplification and explanation of the persona&rsquo;s situation, and finally to 
contradiction, by analogy with body language. Along this continuum, the 
accompaniment represents an environment which is at first simply inert, in later 
stages is quiescent, becomes active, and finally oppositional. I have then 
identified three problematic issues in the simple assumption of a 
melody/accompaniment dualism: that of complementation; that of the wordless 
melody; and the non-unitary nature of some accompaniments. And I do not pretend 
that this list is exhaustive, or even that these are the only points to mark on 
the continuum. What I hope I have demonstrated, however, is that not only is a
 reduction of the operative sphere of meaning of a song to that of its lyrics 
inadequate, but that the same goes for a reduction of such a sphere to that of 
its lyrics and how they are sung. Even without consideration of production 
manipulation, concentration on that very rich amalgam which constitutes the 
track&rsquo;s personic environment is absolutely crucial if we are to fully experience 
the expressive richness of popular song.</p>
