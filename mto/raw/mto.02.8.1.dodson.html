<p><h3>[1] Introduction</h3>
<p>[1.1] During the past few decades, theorists have been rethinking the concept 
of musical meter at a fundamental level. In recent literature, meter has been 
described not as a static pattern of accents intrinsic to the musical object, 
but rather as a dynamic process whose existence depends on human 
participation.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> This shift can be demonstrated through the following 
contrasting definitions of meter, drawn from the first and second editions of <i>The New Grove</i>, respectively:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1980 ed.: The organization of the notes in a composition, or a section thereof, 
  with respect to time, in such a way that a regular pulse made up of beats can 
  be perceived and the time span occupied by each note can be measured in terms 
  of these beats; in addition, the beats are grouped into larger units called bars, 
  within which the number of beats is always the same.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
  <p>2001 ed.: [T]he temporal hierarchy of subdivisions, beats and bars that is 
  maintained by performers and inferred by listeners which functions as a dynamic 
  temporal framework for the production and comprehension of musical durations. 
  In this sense, meter is more an aspect of the behaviour of performers and listeners 
  than an aspect of the music itself.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these definitions allude to music perception, and the distinction 
between them might be understood to reflect a shift in the orientation of music 
perception research that occurred in the 1980s. Traditionally, perception was 
understood as the relatively passive mental reproduction of a given physical 
stimulus, but it is now generally considered to be an active, constructive (as 
opposed to reconstructive) process.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The revised definition of meter might 
also be understood against the backdrop of a similar, though perhaps more 
gradual, paradigm shift in music theory and in music scholarship generally. 
Largely in response to far-reaching methodological and ideological critiques, 
notably Joseph Kerman&rsquo;s <i>Contemplating Music</i> and subsequent 
work by postmodernists and gender theorists, we seem to have become increasingly 
skeptical of the objectification of musical works and the quasi-taxonomic interpretation 
of their elements.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> In this light, it seems especially appropriate that today&rsquo;s 
theorists should emphasize the subjective contingency, as opposed to the autonomy, 
of meter.</p>
<p>[1.2] In the present article, I will explore some of the theoretical and analytical 
ramifications of the recent reconceptualization of meter, especially the effects 
of performing nuance on meter perception. I will take as my point of departure the 
discussion of the interaction of meter and performance in Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
<i>A Generative Theory of Tonal Music</i> (<i>GTTM</i>).<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> I have chosen this text for 
several reasons. First, <i>GTTM</i> has proven to be among the most convincing sustained 
exercises in psychologically informed music theory.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Second, it has been highly 
influential among theorists interested in meter and among music psychologists interested 
in performance, so it can be seen as a well-established link between the literatures 
on which I will draw.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Third, the language of <i>GTTM</i> is extremely clear, 
and the theory&rsquo;s methodological foundations and orientation have been explained 
thoroughly.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> For example, the authors introduce the theory as an attempt to 
capture in formal language &ldquo;the musical intuitions of a <i>listener</i> who is experienced in 
a musical idiom,&rdquo; rather than aspects of the composer&rsquo;s intentions or intrinsic 
properties of musical works.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Furthermore, the authors are frank about the theory&rsquo;s 
shortcomings, thus reminding the reader that <i>GTTM</i> is incomplete and suggesting 
that it has room for expansion and refinement.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Fourth, the passage 
from <i>GTTM</i> that I will take as my point of departure is related to three topics 
that have remained controversial during the nearly two decades since the publication 
of <i>GTTM</i>. These include discussions on the interrelationship between musical 
structure and performance, on the epistemological foundations for comparing different 
performances of the same piece, and on the degree to which hypermeter can be irregular. 
(By &ldquo;hypermeter,&rdquo; I mean the projection of a pattern of strong and weak beats across 
units larger than one measure.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>) Of these three controversial topics, I will 
say most about the third, but I would like to offer a few 
remarks on the first two issues at the outset.</p>
<p>[1.3] Commentaries on the relationships between musical structure and performance 
form an increasingly prominent genre in the literature of music theory.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In a 
recent critique of the rhetoric most often employed in this genre, and in music 
analysis generally, Nicholas Cook draws attention to the dogmatic, prescriptive 
tone that is typical of analysts&rsquo; suggestions to performers.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> As an alternative, 
Cook recommends that we strive for a more balanced dialogue in which neither the 
analyst nor the performer is considered to have the upper hand. By invoking J. L. 
Austin&rsquo;s theory of speech-acts, Cook proposes that we might begin to read analyses 
not only as truth-claims (which Austin terms &ldquo;constative utterances&rdquo;) but also as 
acts of persuasion (&ldquo;performative utterances&rdquo;), thus highlighting a deep similarity 
between musical performance and analytical writing.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Building on earlier polemics 
by Tim Howell and Lawrence Rosenwald, Cook also encourages analysts to listen to 
performances and recordings and to make descriptive, as opposed to prescriptive, 
remarks on the relationships between structure and performance.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> In another recent 
essay, Joel Lester demonstrates this strategy convincingly by showing parallels 
between various recordings and analyses in the case of structurally ambiguous passages. 
For example, Lester shows how two different analytic perspectives on a Mozart minuet 
correspond to details in recordings of the piece by Lili Kraus and Vladimir Horowitz.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
I will adopt a similar discursive strategy in my readings of hypermeter in the opening 
of a Mozart symphony by showing structural models that seem to fit best with the 
nuances of four different recordings, but I will also go further and explore in 
purely theoretical terms how we might begin to account for the diversity encountered 
in a comparison of diverse performances. </p>
<p>[1.4] An important methodological question faces those of us who would like to theorize 
the interrelationships of performance and structure, and in particular the effects 
of different performances on the listener&rsquo;s perception of structure: what is the 
conceptual framework within which comparisons between performances can be made at all, 
that is, how can we account (in theoretical, as opposed to historical or stylistic, 
terms) for the differences that we encounter in comparative listening? At one extreme, 
scholars who aspire to positive knowledge, who contend that we should aim for a 
single, comprehensive analysis of any work, might be expected to evaluate the quality 
of a performance on the basis of the convincingness of the analysis that it seems 
to reflect and to consider the differences between performances to be a result of 
differences between performers&rsquo; levels of insight.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> At the other extreme, those 
who have embraced pluralism and liberalism would, on principle, question the validity 
of any theory that encourages positivistic thinking, and might instead attribute 
differences between interpretations to the diverse and unpredictable personal and 
cultural contexts of each performance.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> My own approach lies somewhere between 
these two extreme positions, because I would like to bypass certain methodological 
obstacles latent in each: the former paradigm (which we might call the positivist 
&ldquo;competition&rdquo; model) is inconsistent with our ability to recognize two very different 
performances of the same work to be more-or-less equally convincing, and the latter 
(which we might call the pluralist &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; model) seems too broad to be commensurate 
with the project of discussing differences between performances primarily in terms 
of the perception of structure. </p>
<p>[1.5] My approach is based on a third paradigm, which I call the &ldquo;alternative stabilization&rdquo; 
model of performance comparison. This paradigm will allow me to theorize the differences 
between performances in structural terms, but to do so without privileging one performance 
over the others. At this point, I will describe its premises in only the most general 
and practical terms. When analyzing a work through <i>reading</i> it from the score, 
one sometimes encounters genuine ambiguities, passages in which some aspect of the 
structure perplexingly eludes a single preferred interpretation.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> In <i>listening</i> 
to performances and recordings, however, much more information is available than 
would be found in the score alone. As Nicholas Cook recently reminded us, scores 
are not only potential objects of analysis, but also function as &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; in many 
of the social contexts in which notation is sounded out&mdash;scripts to which a performance 
serves as a sort of supplement.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> I am interested in situations in which this 
supplement removes, or at least reduces, the degree of ambiguity encountered in 
reading the score, such that the listener is unaware of the ambiguity, or at least 
less inclined than the reader to describe the structure in question as ambiguous. 
The performer must choose only one of the possible interpretations, so naturally 
performances can be compared to one another regarding the choices made by 
performers.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> In the case of works or passages for which multiple versions exist 
in notation (e.g., &ldquo;ossia&rdquo; passages in Romantic piano music) or for which there 
is a pronounced improvisatory element (e.g., Corelli&rsquo;s slow movements, jazz), this 
stabilizing effect is perhaps most obvious.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> In the case of hypermeter, however, 
it is not the notes that are chosen, but rather the subtle expressive nuances of 
a performance, including details of timing, dynamics, and timbre, that provide the 
stabilizing effect. </p>
<p>[1.6] Clearly, the phenomenon I am describing is incommensurate with the (Platonist) 
notion that for every work there is a singular ideal form. It would seem very difficult 
to reconcile the notion of alternative stabilization with a theory heavily informed 
by Western aesthetics and metaphysics. Heinrich Schenker, for example, insisted 
that for every masterwork there is a single correct interpretation of the voice-leading 
structure, and a rejection of this claim would amount to a fundamental change to 
the philosophy of Schenkerian theory.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Though I find the question of the interaction 
of musical ontology and performance fascinating, it is in fact tangential to this 
study, for I am thematizing perceptions, not speculative metaphysical fictions about 
the origins of a work or performance.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> In my view, the issue of ambiguity and 
stability in <i>GTTM</i> should instead be discussed in relation to the theory&rsquo;s 
grounding in Gestalt psychology, a school of thought that sought to explain the 
coherence of things without recourse to idealism.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>
<p>[1.7] Contrary to popular belief, the leading exponents of Gestalt psychology did 
not base their research on the clich&eacute;, &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its 
parts.&rdquo; Rather, they claimed that the perception of the whole is categorically different 
from a summation of perceived parts.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Max Wertheimer was the first psychologist 
to argue that percepts are not put together piecemeal but rather are understood 
intuitively and immediately according to basic aesthetic principles, such that one 
should proceed from the whole to the parts rather than the reverse in any attempt 
to theorize perception.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> Wertheimer&rsquo;s most basic principle is the &ldquo;Law of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> 
[precision],&rdquo; which was most clearly expressed by his colleague Kurt Koffka: &ldquo;Psychological 
organization will always be as &lsquo;good&rsquo; as the prevailing conditions allow. In this 
definition the term &lsquo;good&rsquo; is undefined. It embraces such properties as regularity, 
symmetry, simplicity, and others which we shall meet in the course of our discussion.&rdquo; 
Some of these &ldquo;others&rdquo; include &ldquo;unity, uniformity, good continuation, simple shape, 
and closure,&rdquo; all of which are discussed at some length in Koffka&rsquo;s encyclopedic 
<i>Principles of Gestalt Psychology</i>.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> Lerdahl and Jackendoff explain that the 
Law of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> is closely associated with their Preference Rules (PRs), whose 
main purpose in <i>GTTM</i> is to capture the sense of stability associated with 
the hierarchical organization of tonal music. (I will have more to say on PRs below.) 
In fact, they claim that &ldquo;the preference rules in effect constitute an explicit 
statement of the Law of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> as it applies to musical perception.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> The 
intricacies of perceptual stability and instability are perhaps best illustrated 
in the work of the Edgar Rubin and his circle, who are remembered for their studies 
on the perception of ambiguous visual stimuli. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Ambiguity and stabilization: (a) the &ldquo;faces/vase&rdquo; illusion, (b) faces, (c) vase, (d&ndash;e) symmetry effect, (f) tristability, (g) multistability</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="dodson_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="dodson_ex01_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[1.8] A few variations on Rubin&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;faces/vase&rdquo; drawing will serve as a first 
attempt at a visual analogy for what I have termed the alternative stabilization 
phenomenon (<b>Example 1</b><sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup>). Let us say we have a score in which two interpretations of the location 
of a phrase boundary seem equally tenable to the <i>reader</i>. This experience is a 
bit like looking at Rubin&rsquo;s drawing (Example 1a) and being unable to decide whether 
it depicts two faces or a vase. The location of the phrase boundary might 
be less ambiguous from the <i>listener&rsquo;s</i> perspective, however, because performing nuances, 
like a few embellishments to Rubin&rsquo;s drawing, can increase the perceptual stability 
of either interpretation (see Example 1b&ndash;c). Another visual analogy, which uses a subtler 
manipulation and also eliminates the representational component of the drawing, 
thus bringing the analogy closer to <i>GTTM</i> (a formalist theory), comes from 
the work of Rubin&rsquo;s student Paul Bahnsen, who examined the perceptual effects of 
the shape of the border between alternating black and white regions. Perception 
might be expected to be unstable when all borders are parallel or all borders are 
irregular, but it is highly stable when borders of either the black or white regions 
are symmetrical (as in Example 1d&ndash;e). This might be seen as an analogy for the projection 
of phrase boundaries through the use of &ldquo;phrase rubato,&rdquo; which (perhaps coincidentally) 
is itself symmetrical, for the performer typically begins the phrase relatively 
slowly, accelerates to the climax, and decelerates at the end of the phrase.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> 
I should add that some ambiguous figures, like some musical passages, have more 
than two possible interpretations. For instance, a single curved line (Example 1f) might 
be seen as the border of a figure to the left, the border of a figure to the right, 
or simply a line superimposed on a continuous background. This line is referred 
to as a &ldquo;tristable&rdquo; figure, since it can be interpreted in three different ways. 
Still more extravagant is the ambiguity found in some multistable mosaic patterns 
(Example 1g). I will leave it to the reader to imagine some manipulations that would 
stabilize patterns like Example 1(f) and (g).</p>
<p>[1.9] We are now ready to explore some of the ways <i>GTTM</i> might be developed 
to account more fully for the impact of performance on the listener&rsquo;s experience 
of hypermeter. In Part 2, I will examine Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s position on this 
subject, which appears in the context of an argument against the perception of irregular 
hypermeter. In Part 3, I will attempt to revise the classification of accent types 
in <i>GTTM</i> to include a category that I call &ldquo;Phenomenal Micro-accents&rdquo; (PMs) 
and discuss the importance of these accents in the case of otherwise unstable metric 
and hypermetric structures. In Part 4, I will present analyses of hypermeter in 
the opening measures of Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony No. 40 in G Minor in four different recordings 
and illustrate the stabilizing effects of their different patterns of PMs, and I 
will also develop formal transformation rules that model the listener&rsquo;s ability 
to hear the irregularities in these patterns as modifications of an inferred, perfectly 
regular metrical pattern. Finally, in Part 5, I will offer a more general critique 
of Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s position on the relationship between performance and 
their analytic process, and I will also identify some avenues for further research.</p>
<h3>[2] Hypermeter and Performance in GTTM</h3>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>. Metrical Structure in the opening measures of the Scherzo from Beethoven&rsquo;s Symphony No. 2</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="dodson_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="dodson_ex02_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p><a name="2.1"></a>[2.1] In <i>GTTM</i>, the term &ldquo;Metrical Structure&rdquo; (MS) refers to accent patterns within 
the measure (sometimes called &ldquo;bar meter&rdquo;) as well as meter-like organization across 
spans smaller than measures (i.e., quasi-metric subdivisions of beats) and larger 
than measures (i.e., hypermeter).<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> In Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s ingenious notational 
system for MS, a dot under the score represents the point in time corresponding 
to a beat, and the number of dots in a given column indicates the accentual strength 
at that point relative to other beats in the hierarchy.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> Their analysis of the 
opening of a Beethoven scherzo (<b>Example 2</b><sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup>) demonstrates this system well. The local 
triple meter is shown by the presence of a dot at level (b) under every third dot 
at level (a). Three levels of hypermeter, all duple, can be inferred by comparing 
the dots of the remaining pairs of adjacent levels in the example. Levels (b) and 
(c) show five two-bar hypermeasures, (c) and (d) show two full four-bar hypermeasures, 
and levels (d) and (e) show a single full eight-bar hypermeasure. For simplicity, 
I will refer to hypermetric levels by number, with H<sub>1</sub> being the first level of 
hypermeter, H<sub>2</sub> the second, and so on.</p>
<p><a name="2.2"></a>[2.2] Each of the four main components of <i>GTTM</i> (of which MS is one) is 
governed by two sets of rules. The practice of developing rule systems stems from 
the system of transformational linguistics developed by Noam Chomsky, Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
mentor.<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> These rules are supposed to model the largely automatic cognitive processing 
by which musical surfaces are parsed. Many of the principles formalized in the Rule 
Index of <i>GTTM</i> come from Gestalt psychology and from more recent research 
in music perception. Preference Rules (PRs) are designed to capture the way experienced 
listeners interpret a unique combination of structural details.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> As  mentioned 
above, PRs are  concerned mainly with clarifying perceptual stability, and they are 
applied to each piece <i>ad hoc</i> after the more general constraints captured by Well-Formedness 
Rules (WFRs) have been applied. Metrical Well-Formedness Rules (MWFRs) determine 
the number of levels and their patterns of strong and weak beats, while Metrical 
Preference Rules (MPRs) encourage the most logical alignment of this pattern with 
events at the musical surface such as dynamic accents, long notes, and cadences.

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b>.

<p>[2.3] Lerdahl and Jackendoff mention hypermetric ambiguity in their introductory 
remarks on MS in the opening measures of Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony No. 40 in G Minor, a 
passage they consider to be &ldquo;not untypically complex&rdquo; in its metrical organization.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> 
They use this passage to demonstrate that hypermeter is often restricted to levels 
close to the foreground, in opposition to the view that hypermeter can operate at 
even the deepest structural levels.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> Near the beginning of the passage, odd-numbered 
measures are more strongly accented than even-numbered measures, but the reverse 
is true by measure 20. The only way to rationalize this, according to the authors, is 
to infer a single three-bar hypermeasure in the midst of a series of two-bar hypermeasures. 
They offer two equally plausible readings of where this eccentric hypermeasure might 
be found (see <b>Example 3</b><sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup>). In reading A, the shift to even-measure accents occurs at 
what seems to be the latest possible moment, the downbeat of measure 14, while in reading 
B, the shift occurs at the first sign of change, the downbeat of measure 10.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.4] Lerdahl and Jackendoff then claim that, despite the instability created 
by the irregular hypermeasure, &ldquo;the performer&rsquo;s choice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. can tip the balance 
one way or the other for the listener.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> In other words, a performance might 
evoke a clear sense of hypermeter in the passage, but no such clarity is available 
on the basis of the score alone. (This claim calls to mind Example 1, which illustrates 
how a perceptually unstable figure can be stabilized through subtle manipulations. 
See especially Example 1b&ndash;e.) Although the authors claim that hypermeter can exist in 
this passage, they abstain from working out in practical terms precisely <i>how</i> 
features of performance might be understood to stabilize the hypermeter. 
Instead, they decide only to consider regularly spaced beats in their theory of 
MS, at least at the <i>tactus</i> 
(most salient metrical level) and immediately larger levels (MWFR 4). They do propose 
a special &ldquo;Metrical Deletion&rdquo; rule that deals with irregularities arising from situations 
like phrase elision and overlapping, but neither the rule index nor the formal discussion 
of MS gives evidence that the analytic implications of the potential &ldquo;balance-tipping&rdquo; 
effect of performance have been accounted for.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.5] Although the variability of performance provides Lerdahl and Jackendoff 
with a pragmatic objection to irregular hypermeter, and consequently to deep levels 
of hypermeter in most contexts, it is not clear that this difficulty amounts to 
a <i>theoretical</i> impasse. I would suggest that most experienced listeners­apparently 
including Lerdahl and Jackendoff themselves­perceive some degree of quasi-metrical 
organization in the Mozart excerpt shown in Example 3 across spans larger than one measure. 
In order that the theory might better capture the experienced listener&rsquo;s intuitions, 
I consider it worthwhile to develop in formal terms the &ldquo;balance-tipping&rdquo; effect 
that Lerdahl and Jackendoff mention. Clearly, irregular hypermeter is more complex 
than regular hypermeter, and thus more difficult to formalize, but it seems to me 
that this complexity ought to be confronted rather than avoided. In particular, 
I would argue that the degree of hypermetric irregularity typically encountered 
in performances of the Mozart excerpt is not so extreme as to obviate any sense 
of hypermeter; this excerpt seems to lie in the vast &ldquo;grey area&rdquo; between regular 
and random proportions, between the obvious and the incomprehensible. </p>

<p>[2.6] Gestalt psychology again provides a useful analogy. According to one interpretation 
of the Law of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i>, the purpose of the act of perception is to simplify or 
regularize the information given in the stimulus if it is possible to do so 
(<b>Example 4</b>).<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> 
Thus, a perfectly regular shape such as the one shown in Example 4a may be altered to 
some degree, as in Example 4b&ndash;c, without causing the lack of integrity found in a random 
collection of line segments, such as Example 4d. This very principle enables Lerdahl 
and Jackendoff to explain away the subtle durational irregularities found at the 
beat-to-beat level in performance; they note that listeners are able to infer a 
regular pulse underlying a musical surface transformed through <i>tempo rubato</i>.<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> 
They do not, however, explore the functioning of this type of manipulation at the 
level of the measure or hypermeasure, and the reason for this again seems to be 
a practical rather than a theoretical problem, namely, how to determine with precision 
what should be included in the inferred metrically regular musical surface that 
preceded the transformation.</p>
<p>[2.7] In the formal language of <i>GTTM</i>, the phenomenon I am describing could 
best be captured through a series of &ldquo;transformational rules.&rdquo; This category of 
rules, which is separate from the WFRs and PRs, is loosely based on grammatical 
transformations such as the change from active to passive voice or from present 
to past tense.<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup> The transformational rules in GTTM reverse the changes to the 
musical surface brought about by processes like phrase overlapping and elision.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> 
In order to adhere to this notationally oriented practice, our transformational 
rules for hypermetric irregularities would need to be able to generate entire measures 
of inferred music. In an earlier attempt at applying Chomsky&rsquo;s principle of grammatical 
transformation to music, Leonard Bernstein did just that: he recomposed the opening 
of Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony No. 40 in such a way that regular metrical structures are found 
at levels H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>, that is, hypermeter at the level of the double- and quadruple-measure 
(<b>Example 5</b><sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> and accompanying Audio<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup>). Bernstein&rsquo;s newly composed material (measures 1&ndash;3, 15&ndash;16, 19&ndash;20, 23&ndash;24, 28&ndash;31, and 34&ndash;36) amounts to sixteen additional measures, making it two-thirds longer than 
the passage on which it is based. Lerdahl and Jackendoff claim that this type of 
approach is untenable, because it is too &ldquo;hypothetical,&rdquo; by which I think they mean 
too far removed from the actual listening experience, and because it is so arbitrary 
in its details. While I agree with this assessment, I nevertheless find Bernstein&rsquo;s 
approach thought-provoking. As I mentioned near the beginning of this paper, meter 
is now regarded primarily as a construct created by the performer and listener, 
rather than an inherent and fully determined property of a musical work or score. 
One property of this construct appears to be that, once formed, it can be separated 
substantially from the musical surface. For instance, once we know a piece, we can 
imagine or even physically &ldquo;feel&rdquo; its metrical pattern without also imagining other 
parameters, such as the pitch materials. Indeed, psychologists have found empirical 
support for the human cognitive ability to form abstract, hierarchical mental representations 
of musical meter, and this finding seems highly compatible with Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
MS theory and its associated analytic notation.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> In my view, then, it should 
be sufficient to show the transformation of irregular hypermeter in an abstract 
sense rather than proposing transformations at the level of the musical surface. 
The schematic representation of MS in a given passage can easily be compared to 
a hypothetical, perfectly regular MS, and processes like metrical expansion and 
truncation can be reversed.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> For instance, it is clear that both of the MS interpretations 
of the Mozart example that Lerdahl and Jackendoff offer (see Example 3) contain a single 
three-bar hypermeasure amid a stream of two-bar hypermeasures. A transformational 
rule to regularize this pattern, thus modeling the simplifying function of the Law 
of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> in this context, would merely need to reverse this metrical expansion. 
(I will propose such a rule below; see paragraph 4.6.) The location of the departure 
from the regular pattern will depend on the performance, but we will nevertheless 
hear it as a departure <i>from something</i> that is more-or-less regular, stable, and 
comprehensible. That &ldquo;something&rdquo; is the underlying hypermeter.</p>
<p>[2.8] It is tempting to accuse Lerdahl and Jackendoff of succumbing to the influence 
of an insidious aesthetic bias, the so-called &ldquo;autonomy ideology,&rdquo; on the grounds 
that they are reluctant to formalize the dependency of an analysis on a specific 
performance. That is, one could speculate that their &ldquo;balance-tipping&rdquo; analogy (see 
the passage from <i>GTTM</i> quoted in paragraph 2.4) is abandoned in their theoretical 
discussion because it is incommensurable with contemplating the inner workings of 
an autonomous (i.e., radically independent) musical work. This accusation would 
be unfair, however, given that Lerdahl and Jackendoff explicitly avoid the discussion 
of aesthetics; in subsequent publications, they have repeatedly pointed out that
<i>GTTM</i> theorizes aspects of the comprehensibility of a work, not its aesthetic 
qualities, and that these two parameters are not always closely related.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup> <i>
GTTM</i> might be regarded as a method for developing the simplest interpretation 
of a tonal work&rsquo;s hierarchical dimensions, for bringing the interpretation as close 
to the Gestalt ideal of &ldquo;good form&rdquo; as possible, such that a <i>GTTM</i>-style analysis 
can be thought of as representing structural intuitions that operate on the most 
perceptually &ldquo;stable&rdquo; events in a piece of tonal music. In other words, although 
it is a formalist theory, it attempts to escape idealism and instead to account 
for musical intuitions in terms of psychological principles drawn mainly from the 
work of the Gestalt school.<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> In this light, it would seem most appropriate to 
object to the abandonment of the balance-tipping model on the grounds of the Law 
of <i>Pr&auml;gnanz</i> (see paragraph 1.7), rather than an aesthetic bias.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup> As we have 
seen, this law begins, &ldquo;Psychological organization will always be as &#39;good&#39; as the 
prevailing conditions allow.&rdquo; I would argue that the limiting factor­the &ldquo;prevailing 
conditions&rdquo; alluded to in this definition­should at least potentially include 
all of the information contained in the aural stimulus, including features specific 
to an individual performance. The main obstacle to developing Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
balance-tipping model would therefore seem to be not an ideological conflict but 
rather the practical difficulty of describing the elements of a performance with 
adequate precision.</p>

<p>[2.9] It has long been recognized that the projection of a structural interpretation 
is one function of the expressive nuances that performers add in their realizations 
of scores. These nuances are sometimes termed &ldquo;systematic variations&rdquo; (abbreviated 
SYVARs), because they can be described in quantitative terms as patterns of departures 
from mechanical regularity in a given domain, such as speed or loudness.<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> In 
the case of an unambiguous structure, it would be relatively unproblematic to assume 
a direct, linear connection between the score and the &ldquo;musical surface&rdquo; (i.e., the 
aural presentation of the music), so long as the hypothetical performer adheres 
to the same SYVAR conventions that the listener has absorbed through aural experience 
with the musical idiom (see <b>Example 6a</b>). In such cases, the absence of PRs pertaining 
to performing nuances in the rule index of <i>GTTM</i> seems unproblematic; in a 
conventional performance, structural interpretations are projected rather than obfuscated 
or contradicted.<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup> In the case of an ambiguous structure, however, the musical 
surface that is presented to the listener is often much clearer than the score itself.<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> 
It should follow that, in the case of ambiguous structures, the role of the performer&rsquo;s 
interpretive preference, as expressed through SYVARs, deserves some consideration 
(see <b>Example 6b&ndash;c</b>). The fact that these SYVARs cannot be predicted definitively on the 
basis of a score makes them no less relevant to a theory of the listener&rsquo;s intuitions.</p>
<h3>[3] Extending the Theory of Phenomenal Accents</h3>
<p>[3.1] In this section I will explore some of the implications of Lerdahl and 
Jackendoff&rsquo;s fleetingly proposed connection between performing nuance and perceptual 
stability in the Mozart excerpt. My approach involves extending one category of 
accents to the extreme foreground, the level at which performing nuances operate, 
and it is informed by (mostly) post-<i>GTTM</i> investigations of SYVARs in expert 
performance. I contend that, in the absence of complete metrical stability (i.e., 
regularity), a class of contextual features­namely, features introduced in performance­becomes increasingly relevant to the listener&rsquo;s sense of metrical structure (MS). 
Here I am simply transposing an argument from Lerdahl&rsquo;s &ldquo;Atonal Prolongational
Structure&rdquo; from the domain of tonality to that of meter; Lerdahl claims that in 
music where tonal stability is deliberately compromised, a sense of quasi-tonal 
prolongation might still be inferred on the basis of contextually salient events.<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.2] The discussion of MS in <i>GTTM</i> begins with an innovative system for 
classifying the different types of accent cues whose combined effects enable listeners 
to infer metrical patterns. Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s explanation of the relationships 
between phenomenal and metrical accents is of crucial importance to the present 
study, so I shall quote it at some length:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In our judgment it is essential to distinguish three kinds of accents: 
  phenomenal, structural, and metrical. By <i>phenomenal accent</i> we mean any event at the musical 
  surface that gives emphasis or stress to a moment in the musical flow. Included 
  in this category are attack points of pitch events, local stresses such as sforzandi, 
  sudden changes in dynamics or timbre, long notes, leaps to relatively high or 
  low notes, harmonic changes, and so forth. By <i>structural accent</i> we mean 
  an accent caused by the melodic/harmonic points of gravity in a phrase or 
  section­especially by the cadence, the goal of tonal motion. By <i>metrical 
  accent</i> we mean any beat 
  that is relatively strong in its metrical context<nobr>. . .</nobr></p>
  <p>Phenomenal accent functions as a perceptual input to metrical accent­that 
  is, the moments of musical stress in the raw signal serve as &ldquo;cues&rdquo; from which 
  the listener attempts to extrapolate a regular pattern of metrical accents. If 
  there is little regularity to these cues, or if they conflict, the sense of metrical 
  accent becomes attenuated or ambiguous. If on the other hand the cues are regular 
  and mutually supporting, the sense of metrical accent becomes definite and multileveled. 
  Once a clear metrical pattern has been established, the listener renounces it 
  only in the face of strongly contradicting evidence<nobr>. . .</nobr></p>
  <p>In sum, the listener&rsquo;s cognitive task is to match the given pattern of phenomenal 
  accentuation as closely as possible to a permissible pattern of metrical accentuation; 
  where the two patterns diverge, the result is syncopation, ambiguity, or some 
  other kind of rhythmic complexity. Metrical accent, then, is a mental construct, 
  inferred from but not identical to the patterns of accentuation in the musical 
  surface.<sup><a name="FN59REF" href="#FN59" id="footnote59">(59)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, they explain what they mean by &ldquo;local stresses such as sforzandi&rdquo; and 
further explain the relationship between stresses and metrical accents:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>By local stress we mean extra intensity on the attack of a pitch-event. We 
  include as signs of stress not only those marked by the signs &gt; and ^, but 
  also those indicated by <i>sf</i>, <i>rf</i>, <i>fp</i>, and <i>subito</i> <i>f</i>. In a regular sequence of 
  attacked notes, those with stress will preferably be heard as strong beats.<sup><a name="FN60REF" href="#FN60" id="footnote60">(60)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="3.3"></a>[3.3] The effects of phenomenal accents on metrical accents are formalized as 
MPRs 4&ndash;5, which address relative stress (i.e., loudness) and length, 
respectively.<sup><a name="FN61REF" href="#FN61" id="footnote61">(61)</a></sup> All the loudness- and length-related accents shown in their 
exemplars for these rules occur at the rather blatant level that notation can 
capture, but I will argue that such accents also occur on a much subtler scale 
in skilled performance. I will call the latter expressive details <i>dynamic</i> 
and <i>agogic micro-accents</i> (DMs and 
AMs), or collectively, <i>phenomenal micro-accents</i> (PMs). In general, their effect 
on listening should be expected to be rather weak owing to their small scale, but 
as Lerdahl and Jackendoff demonstrate in the case of the Mozart excerpt, PMs can 
become extremely important in cases where notational clues offer insufficient support 
for a single preferred reading. In a sense, AMs seem to be incommensurable with 
MWFR 4, which states that beats must be evenly spaced. As I mentioned, however, Lerdahl and Jackendoff do acknowledge that even spacing is easily inferred in the 
case of performances made uneven by expressive timing.<sup><a name="FN62REF" href="#FN62" id="footnote62">(62)</a></sup> I would agree that listeners 
do seem to &ldquo;correct&rdquo; the unevenly spaced beats in expressive performance, but, unlike 
Lerdahl and Jackendoff, I would draw attention to the fact that important information 
is communicated in the discrepancy between the actual sounding event and the evenly 
spaced abstraction.</p>

<p>[3.4] The relationship between metrical accents and what I have called PMs was 
further clarified in subsequent writings by psychologists John A. Sloboda and Eric 
Clarke, among others.<sup><a name="FN63REF" href="#FN63" id="footnote63">(63)</a></sup> Whereas Lerdahl and Jackendoff theorized the effects of 
phenomenal accents on perceived metrical accents, both Sloboda and Clarke studied 
the effects of perceived meter on PMs. They carried out several experiments to determine 
the effects of rhythm and meter notation on performance. In one of Sloboda&rsquo;s studies, several 
melodies were presented to skilled pianists, who performed the melodies on a grand 
piano monitored by a computer interface. Among the experimental melodies were several 
that differed only in the placement of the barline; all other parameters, including 
pitch materials, rhythmic patterns, and expression marks, were unchanged (see 
<b>Example 7</b>). A similar experiment included melodies that differed only in the time signature. 
These experiments showed that skilled pianists usually engage a relatively small 
repertory of SYVARs to project meter, and that their use of these cues is proportional 
to their degree of experience.<sup><a name="FN64REF" href="#FN64" id="footnote64">(64)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.5] Additional empirical studies conducted by both Sloboda and Clarke confirm 
that experienced listeners can identify the meter intended by the performer in the 
case of the ambiguous melodies used in their performance experiments, so PMs would 
seem to be a key to the understanding of each performer&rsquo;s conception of meter in 
any metrically ambiguous passage.<sup><a name="FN65REF" href="#FN65" id="footnote65">(65)</a></sup> Although the purpose of these experiments 
was to determine principles for the effects of notation on performance, not to theorize 
the impact of performance cues on the listening experience, these results are nevertheless 
relevant to our listener-oriented theory of meter and hypermeter. All that is needed 
is a reversal of orientation. By cross-referencing the SYVARs in a given performance 
with the conventions for projecting meter, we should be able to infer the performer&rsquo;s 
metrical interpretation of a passage. Among the SYVARs that Clarke and Sloboda identify 
are dynamic stress and lengthening, which I discussed above in the context of Lerdahl 
and Jackendoff&rsquo;s MPRs 4&ndash;5, as well as the lengthening of the upbeat.<sup><a name="FN66REF" href="#FN66" id="footnote66">(66)</a></sup> I will 
distinguish downbeat lengthening from upbeat lengthening by referring to the former 
as &ldquo;elongation-style&rdquo; and the latter as &ldquo;hesitation-style&rdquo; AMs. Hesitation-style 
AMs appear to be unrelated to any of the existing MPRs and even seem to contradict 
MPR 5(a), which states: &ldquo;Prefer a metrical structure in which a relatively strong 
beat occurs at the inception of . . . a relatively long pitch-event.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN67REF" href="#FN67" id="footnote67">(67)</a></sup> Thus, 
I consider it the weakest of the three classes of PMs relevant to ambiguous cases 
of MS. Nevertheless, its systematic use is well documented in Sloboda&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s 
experiments, and I believe it is widely understood by listeners, so it ought to 
be reflected in an MPR. Therefore, I will propose the following addition to the 
Rule Index in <i>GTTM</i>: MPR 5.5 (Hesitation): &ldquo;Weakly prefer a metrical structure 
in which a relatively strong beat occurs immediately after a relatively long pitch-event.&rdquo; 
(This rule is included in my <a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a>, &ldquo;Revised Rule Index for Metrical Structure.&rdquo;) 
Assuming that these PM cues (i.e., DMs and the two classes of AMs) might also operate 
at levels somewhat deeper than surface meter, we now have the theoretical principles 
needed to assess whether experienced listeners can be expected to infer hypermetric 
interpretations other than the two predicted by <i>GTTM</i> in the case of the opening 
of Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony No. 40 in G Minor. </p>
<h3>[4] Performance Analyses and Transformations</h3>
<p>[4.1] A summary of the techniques that I use for performance analysis is 
included as <a href="#Appendix2">Appendix 2</a>. Essentially, I convert the desired excerpts into sound 
files and analyze the timing and loudness with audio editing software. I should 
emphasize that I have made no attempt at an inductive statistical analysis of 
these performances, that is, to use raw quantitative data as &ldquo;input&rdquo; and propose 
qualitative judgments as &ldquo;output.&rdquo; Instead, I prefer to use empirical data 
selectively (though hopefully not <i>too</i> selectively) in order to articulate qualitative PM judgments and comparisons 
arrived at through careful listening. I begin the performance-analytic procedure 
with close listening in order to avoid attributing importance to distinctions that 
are too fine for the ear to detect under normal listening conditions. Quantitative 
performance analysis is extremely useful in supporting and refining many observations, 
and it also facilitates detailed inter-performance comparisons. Like other forms 
of music analysis, quantitative performance analysis seems helpful in sharpening 
one&rsquo;s sensitivity to fine nuances­in this case to gradations of intensity and 
duration.</p>
<p><a name="4.2"></a>[4.2] In <i>GTTM</i>, beats are considered durationless points in time 
inferred from the musical stimulus. The acoustical correlate to the beat is the
<i>onset</i>, or attack point, of a tone that is understood to articulate the 
beat in question. When we speak loosely of the duration of a beat, we are really 
talking about the interval <i>between</i> beats, and the corresponding acoustical measure is the inter-onset 
interval (IOI). Similarly, when we speak of the loudness of a beat, we are describing 
the loudness of some sound within the IOI whose onset corresponds to the beat in 
question. The acoustical correlate of beat loudness is the peak amplitude within 
an IOI, also known as the peak sound level (PSL). When a beat is subdivided, the 
peak amplitude of the first subdivision is used in estimating DMs.</p>
<p>[4.3] The complete data that I collected from the four recordings that I will 
discuss are given in <a href="#Appendix3">Appendix 3</a>. Caution is often needed in interpreting this numerical 
information, since the values do not always reflect the listening experience accurately. 
Sometimes distinctions are so subtle that they are imperceptible under normal listening 
conditions, so it is important to keep the &ldquo;just-noticeable differences&rdquo; in mind. 
Ballpark figures for these are 5­10% for inter-onset intervals (IOIs) and 
0.5&ndash;2.0 dB for intensities.<sup><a name="FN68REF" href="#FN68" id="footnote68">(68)</a></sup> Also, both onset perception and intensity 
perception vary considerably in relation to pitch and timbre.<sup><a name="FN69REF" href="#FN69" id="footnote69">(69)</a></sup> For example, 
listeners with normal hearing will hear tone <i>x</i> (100 Hz, 50 dB<sub>SPL</sub>) 
and tone <i>y</i> (1000 Hz, 20 dB<sub>SPL</sub>) 
as being equal in loudness despite their vast differences in amplitude. Researchers 
have not seemed to come up with a way to adjust for these perceptual considerations, 
possibly because of complexities that arise in dealing with multi-voice textures, 
pedaling, and the interactions of overtones. Also, perhaps most importantly, this 
type of performance analysis does not allow us to examine the intensities of individual 
voices, so it is sometimes tempting to misread an intensity analysis as a representation 
of melodic dynamics rather than the net dynamics of all voices combined. My interpretation 
of DMs will be based largely on the rankings of downbeat intensities relative to 
one another, not on absolute values, and, in general, I will draw attention only 
to those performance analysis statistics that seem most clearly to reflect and enhance 
the actual listening experience.</p>

<p>[4.4] <b>Example 8</b> includes six hypermetric interpretations of the opening of Mozart&rsquo;s 
Symphony No. 40. The first two are those that Lerdahl and Jackendoff identify, and 
the remaining four are drawn from recordings conducted by Benjamin Britten, Neville 
Marriner, Bruno Walter, and Leonard Bernstein.<sup><a name="FN70REF" href="#FN70" id="footnote70">(70)</a></sup> It is important to note that, 
although all six representations use <i>GTTM</i>-style metrical notation, none is 
derived from the strict application of the rules for MS. (Recall that this is the 
excerpt that Lerdahl and Jackendoff use to illustrate problems in rationalizing 
hypermetric irregularity and to justify the restrictive MWFR 4, which insists on 
even spacing of beats and hyperbeats at the tactus and immediately larger metrical 
levels.)</p>
<p><a name="4.5"></a>[4.5] As I mentioned above (see paragraph 2.7), I will account for the irregularities 
in these metrical patterns by developing transformational rules that apply to MS 
abstractions. I will consider the eccentric hypermeasure in each version to be a 
transformation of an underlying regular hypermeasure. Superficially, it might 
seem that these transformations fracture the metrical structure at this level, 
resulting in a series of fragments that I will call <i>metrical structure 
episodes</i> (abbreviated MSEs). At level H<sub>1</sub>, I submit that the unity underlying each series of MSEs can 
be understood with little effort on the part of the listener. At deeper levels, 
however, an underlying unity cannot always be demonstrated. Nevertheless, in the 
interest of theorizing a rather subtle aspect of the listening experience, I think 
it is worthwhile to attempt to show the integrity of each independent MSE, rather 
than vaguely stating (as Lerdahl and Jackendoff do) that irregularities cause MS 
to become attenuated at deeper levels. Indeed, this approach allows us to trace 
in detail the gradual breakdown of MS from level to level. </p>
<p>[4.6] Let us begin with the two readings proposed by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (Example 8a&ndash;b). Each of these examples includes one instance of triple meter in the context 
of a prevailing duple meter at the first level of hypermeter. The eccentric hypermeasure 
might be understood to result from the process of metrical expansion, the addition 
of a second weak beat between two strong beats. In order to reveal the regular underlying 
structure, a rule for the opposite process is required, a process which I will call 
&ldquo;metrical contraction.&rdquo; This rule should simply state that, in order to regularize 
a pattern such as this, one of the weak beats in the three-beat measure must be 
deleted. This rule can be stated formally as follows:</p>
<p>Metrical Contraction<sup><a name="FN71REF" href="#FN71" id="footnote71">(71)</a></sup></p>
<p>Given<br>
(i) a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>M</i> that ends with beats <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> 
and <i>B<sub>2</sub></i>, in which <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>2</sub></i> are adjacent beats at level
<i>L<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> 
is also a beat at level <i>L<sub>i+1</sub></i>, and <br>
(ii) a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>N</i> in which <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>,
<i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>5</sub></i> 
are adjacent beats at level <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> and only <i>B<sub>3</sub></i> 
is also a beat at level <i>L<sub>i+1</sub></i>, 
and<br>
(iii) a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>P</i> that begins with beats

<p>[4.7] In a performance that projects Interpretation A (Example 8a), the listener 
might at first perceive three MSEs in measures 1&ndash;23: a series of five duple hypermeasures 
(measures 1&ndash;10), followed by one triple hypermeasure (measures 11&ndash;13), followed by five more 
duple hypermeasures (measures 14&ndash;23). If Interpretation B (Example 8b) is projected, the 
listener would instead perceive three duple hypermeasures (measures 1&ndash;6), followed by 
one triple hypermeasure (measures 7&ndash;9), followed by seven duple hypermeasures (measures 10&ndash;23). 
In both cases, the listener might then intuitively reconceive the entire passage 
as a coherent sequence of eleven duple hypermeasures, as suggested by the Metrical 
Contraction rule (<b>Example 9a&ndash;b</b>).<sup><a name="FN72REF" href="#FN72" id="footnote72">(72)</a></sup> That is not to say that the differences between 
the two performances will be ignored, but rather that the two performances will 
be understood as departing from the same underlying metrical structure in different 
ways.</p>
<p>[4.8] Two of the remaining four interpretations (Example 8c and f) can be understood 
to show metrical truncations rather than expansions. That is, in the context of 
a prevailing duple meter at level H<sub>1</sub>, a new hypermeasure begins before the preceding 
one has been completed, such that two strong beats are found side-by-side. In order 
to reverse this process, we require a transformational rule for &ldquo;metrical completion,&rdquo; 
which will stabilize the MS at this level by inserting a weak beat between these 
strong beats. This rule can be stated formally as follows:</p>
<p>Metrical Completion</p>
<p>Given<br>
(i) a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>M</i> that ends with beats <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>2</sub></i>, 
and
<i>B<sub>3</sub></i>, in which <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>3</sub></i> are adjacent beats at level 
<i>L<sub>i</sub></i> and 
both <i>B<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>3</sub></i> are also beats at level <i>L<sub>i+1</sub></i>, and<br>
(ii) a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>N</i> that begins with beats <i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, 
<i>B<sub>5</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>6</sub></i>, in which <i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>5</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>6</sub></i> are adjacent beats at 
level <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> and both <i>B<sub>4</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>6</sub></i> are also beats at level <i>L<sub>i+1</sub></i>, <br>
and given that <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> are adjacent metrical structure episodes,</p>
<p>then a well-formed metrical structure episode <i>M&#39;</i> can be formed by inserting 
beat <i>B<sub>x</sub></i> between beats <i>B<sub>3</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, such that <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>x</sub></i>, 
<i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>5</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>6</sub></i> are adjacent beats at level <i>L<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>, 
<i>B<sub>4</sub></i>, and <i>B<sub>6</sub></i> are also beats at level <i>L<sub>i+1</sub></i>.</p>

<p>[4.9] In all four recordings, strong and weak hyperbeats alternate regularly 
at level H<sub>1</sub> in measures 1&ndash;10, and measure 20 has a strong accent, so I will focus on what 
happens in measures 11&ndash;20. The shift occurs earliest in Britten&rsquo;s version through a succession 
of strong accents on the downbeats of both measure 13 and measure 14 (see Example 8c). The accent 
at 13.1 relative to 12.1 is achieved through a hesitation-style AM (in this case, 
an extension of IOI 12.2 by 14.8%) and a DM (an increase in net amplitude by 0.9 
dB and three ranking points at the downbeat-to-downbeat level).<sup><a name="FN73REF" href="#FN73" id="footnote73">(73)</a></sup> But 14.1 is 
stronger still (by nearly 4 dB and two ranking points), and 15.1 sounds softer than 
14.1 despite the increase in orchestration. (The decrease in net amplitude is insignificant 
at 0.1 dB, but, in light of the expanded texture, the absence of an increase in amplitude 
supports a strong-weak hypermetric pattern in measures 14&ndash;15.) A diminuendo added by Britten through measure 15, an abrupt change in orchestration at 16.2, and an absence 
of clear AMs in these measures create some confusion, but the emphasis on even-numbered 
downbeats is confirmed in measures 17&ndash;20. IOI 18.1 has an elongation-style AM (9.2% longer 
than 17.1), and 19.1 is markedly softer than 18.1 as well (by a margin of 1.8 dB). 
To further reinforce the even-measure accents, 20.1 has an elongation-style AM (7.5%) 
and is the loudest beat in the entire excerpt, which seems especially dramatic 
in light of the absence of a crescendo in measure 19. The resulting pattern has adjacent 
strong beats at 13.1 and 14.1, indicative of a metrical truncation, so the passage 
can be thought of as containing two MSEs (measures 1&ndash;13 and 14&ndash;20), and a regular underlying 
pattern can be generated by applying the Metrical Completion rule (<b>Example 10</b>).</p>

<p>[4.10] In contrast to Britten&rsquo;s interpretation, Marriner preserves the odd-measure 
emphasis until the last possible moment, measures 19&ndash;20 (see Example 8d). In measures 10&ndash;20, this 
is projected extremely clearly through elongation-style agogic accents at 11.1, 
13.1, 15.1, and 17.1 (by 20.0%, 10.9%, 9.4%, and 41.7%, respectively, at the downbeat 
level) as well as dynamic accents on these same beats (all of which have higher 
rankings than the even-measure downbeats that surround them). Indeed, 17.1 rather 
than 20.1 is the loudest downbeat in the excerpt. The arrival of even-measure accentuation 
at 20.1 seems to be associated mostly with the surface rhythm&rsquo;s agogic accent, which 
is further enhanced with an elongation-style AM (6.4%). Note also that 19.1 is the 
first weak odd-measure downbeat in the excerpt; it is somewhat quieter than 18.1 
(-1.7 dB) and about equal in length (IOI 19.1 is only 2 ms or 0.4% longer than 
18.1, an imperceptible difference). The adjacent weak beats at 18.1 and 19.1 
constitute a metrical expansion, and the pattern can be regularized through the 
application of the Metrical Contraction rule (<b>Example 11</b>).</p>

<p>[4.11] Walter&rsquo;s hypermetric interpretation is more complex than the preceding 
two, and this is largely because of clever ambiguities in his deployment of PMs 
(see Example 8e). The odd-measure strong beats established in measures 1&ndash;10 continue at least 
through measure 13. 11.1 is both longer (10.2%) and louder than 10.1, and the relation 
of 13.1 to 12.1 is similar (8.7% longer, 1.2 dB louder overall).<sup><a name="FN74REF" href="#FN74" id="footnote74">(74)</a></sup> It is difficult 
to offer a hypermetric interpretation of measures 14&ndash;16, because the PMs play against 
the notated surface meter. Performers sometimes refer to this effect as a &ldquo;negative 
accent&rdquo; or &ldquo;deflection,&rdquo; and it occurs when a downbeat is considerably quieter than 
the listener would expect on the basis of the upbeat. (See the final column of 
<a href="#Appendix3">Appendix 
3c</a>. These are the only downbeats in the entire excerpt that have negative changes 
in intensity at the beat-to-beat level.) Without a clear projection of surface meter, 
it is difficult to assess the location and strength of hypermetric accents. In the 
absence of evidence to the contrary, I would be inclined to hear a continuation 
of the odd-measure accents through to measure 16. It could be argued that the slight, 
though noticeable, acceleration into 15.1 supports this reading by giving that beat 
a special emphasis. (IOI 14.2 is shortened by 11.2%.) Next, two features 
conspire to encourage us hear a continuation of the odd-measure accents at 17.1: 
the sudden increase in dynamics and orchestration at 16.2 and the literal 
repetition of 16.2&ndash;17.1 in 17.2&ndash;18.1. All else being equal, 17.1&ndash;18.1 would most 
likely be heard as a strong-weak echo effect (<b>Example 12a</b>), a reading consistent with MPR 2.<sup><a name="FN75REF" href="#FN75" id="footnote75">(75)</a></sup> Walter neither 
underlines nor contradicts this reading, however. The first three downbeats after 16.2 sound 
equal in loudness (0.4 dB difference), and despite some elongations that enhance 
the syncopation effect on the second beat of each measure, measures 17&ndash;19 sound steady. 
(All three downbeats are within 5% of the average tempo of the entire excerpt.) 
Thus, it could be argued that Walter leaves the hypermetric interpretation undefined 
in measures 17&ndash;19. There is, however, a salient accent at 20.1 (loudest downbeat IOI 
in the excerpt, 1.4 dB louder than 19.1), and in retrospect this might lead us to 
hear the entire cadential extension (measures 16&ndash;20) in the context of an 
even-measure hypermeter (<b>Example 12b</b>). At that point we would realize that our 
hunch that 17.1&ndash;18.1 was a strong-weak echo was incorrect. In that sense, the 
metric and hypermetric ambiguities of measures 14&ndash;19 (especially measures 17&ndash;19) in the 
Walter recording have a rather humorous effect, and one that adds richness to 
the listening experience. The reading shown in Example 12b (and in Example 8e) 
is the final version that emerges once the accent at 20.1 is heard. Walter&rsquo;s 
interpretation includes a metrical expansion, this time in measures 15&ndash;17, so the 
pattern can be regularized through the Metrical Contraction rule (<b>Example 12c</b>). </p>

<p>[4.12] Bernstein&rsquo;s hypermetric interpretation (Example 8f) is nearly identical to Marriner&rsquo;s (Example 8d) at level H<sub>1</sub>. The most important distinction is that in Bernstein&rsquo;s 
recording, there are strongly pronounced PMs at both 19.1 (2.6 dB louder than IOI 
18.1) and 20.1 (20.8% elongation, 1.2 dB increase compared to 19.1). Thus, 19.1 
is a strong hyperbeat, like all the preceding odd-measure downbeats, rather than 
a weak hyperbeat, like 19.1 in Marriner&rsquo;s recording. In the case of Bernstein&rsquo;s 
recording, the pattern can be regularized through the Metrical Completion rule 
(<b>Example 13</b>). At other points in the excerpt, Marriner and Bernstein project the same interpretation 
by quite different means. For instance, Bernstein&rsquo;s accent at 11.1 seems to be communicated 
through timbre rather than loudness and elongation.<sup><a name="FN76REF" href="#FN76" id="footnote76">(76)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.13] So far I have been describing only the first level of hypermeter, that 
is, MS at the level of the double-measure. Lerdahl and Jackendoff suggest that a 
deeper level of hypermeter should include strong accents at 16.1 and 22.1, because 
these are points of harmonic arrival and might therefore be understood as structural 
accents. Stated in the terminology I have developed, this means that measures 16&ndash;21 form 
an MSE containing a three-beat hypermeasure plus a downbeat at level H<sub>2</sub> (<b>Example 14</b>). 
Although Lerdahl and Jackendoff situate this six-bar episode at the &ldquo;4-bar level,&rdquo; 
implying that it is a transformation of two underlying two-bar MSEs, they do not 
clarify this transformation because they rightly consider it futile to attempt such 
a thing in music-notational terms and on the basis of the score alone.<sup><a name="FN77REF" href="#FN77" id="footnote77">(77)</a></sup> Overall, 
Lerdahl and Jackendoff consider level H<sub>2</sub>, aside from this singular MSE, to be 
too ambiguous to explore, and they even go so far as to say, &ldquo;The 4-bar level simply 
does not have much meaning for this passage.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN78REF" href="#FN78" id="footnote78">(78)</a></sup> I would argue that, despite the 
ambiguity of the score, metrical organization across spans of four or even eight 
measures can be conveyed, at least episodically, in the performance of this excerpt. 
Owing to the instability caused by the erosion of regularity at these levels, the 
MS interpretation becomes increasingly dependent on salient PMs. (Here I am again 
invoking Lerdahl&rsquo;s hypothesis that contextual salience becomes crucial to the construction 
of hierarchical structures when stability conditions are compromised. See paragraph 
3.1 above.) Although the structures I am about to describe lie deep within the grey 
area between stability and instability, or between comprehensibility and incomprehensibility, 
I think they deserve some consideration.</p>

<p>[4.14] In Britten&rsquo;s recording, an MSE consisting of an upbeat plus two duple 
hypermeasures can be shown at the level H<sub>2</sub> in measures 1&ndash;10 (<b>Example 15a</b>). This can be 
confirmed by comparing the beats found at the level H<sub>1</sub> within this passage (i.e., 
beats 1.1, 3.1, 5.1, 7.1, and 9.1). Of these, 1.1 is clearly the weakest. (Indeed, 
it is ranked last among the first twenty downbeats.) A strong-weak pattern is then 
established through qualitative differences between 3.1 and 5.1. Whereas the former 
is prepared with a hesitation-style AM (IOI 2.2 is 7.1% longer than 2.1), the latter 
is anticipated slightly (IOI 4.2 is 8.8% shorter than 4.1), and this conveys the 
impression that 3.1 is accented with conviction, while 5.1 occurs almost by accident. 
Similarly, the DM on 5.1 sounds like a &ldquo;jolt&rdquo; in all voices, while 3.1 has a distinct 
melodic accent.<sup><a name="FN79REF" href="#FN79" id="footnote79">(79)</a></sup> Still clearer is the distinction between 7.1 and 9.1. The former 
is both louder and longer than the latter (by a margin of 5.2 dB and 9.2%, respectively), 
and at the measure-to-measure level, 7.1 has a stronger elongation-style AM and 
a stronger DM than 9.1 (20.8% vs. 5.1%, and 5.3 dB vs. 1.5 dB, respectively). A further 
distinction can be shown between the two strong beats at the level H<sub>2</sub>, and this 
produces a third level of hypermeter in this MSE. Beat 7.1 has a greater DM and 
AM than 3.1, and this creates an upbeat-downbeat figure (<b>Example 15b</b>). Beats 3.1 and 
7.1 are preceded by similar degrees of hesitation (7.1% and 6.3%, respectively), 
but 7.1 has an additional elongation-style AM (13.6%) as well as a considerably 
stronger DM than 3.1 (5.3 dB at the downbeat-to-downbeat level, vs. 2.5 dB). Note, 
however, that this interpretation is rather fragile. It includes only a partial 
hypermeasure, and the downbeat&rsquo;s position in the seventh measure of a ten-measure MSE seems unusually late. The latter objection is formalized in GTTM as MPR 2 (Strong 
Beat Early): &ldquo;Weakly prefer a metrical structure in which the strongest beat in 
a group appears relatively early in the group.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN80REF" href="#FN80" id="footnote80">(80)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.15] After the conclusion of the first MSE in Britten&rsquo;s recording, hypermeter 
seems to be attenuated at level H<sub>2</sub> until measure 14. This is because each of the next 
three strong beats at level H<sub>1</sub> (i.e., 11.1, 13.1, and 14.1) has a stronger DM 
than the last (+0.5 dB, +0.6 dB, and +3.8 dB, respectively). A second MSE 
(<b>Example 16a</b>) is weakly suggested, 
however, by PMs in measures 14&ndash;20. The distinctions are again largely 
qualitative. The DM at 20.1 (+2.3 dB compared to IOI 19.1), in combination with 
the changes in texture, harmony, and dynamics that immediately follow it, seems 
more prominent than the elongation-style AM at 18.1 (12.4%). Also, as discussed 
above, the status of 16.1 as a beat at this level is achieved mainly by inference, 
in light of the complications introduced by the change in texture at 16.2. It would 
therefore seem reasonable to regard it as a weaker beat than 14.1, which is very 
strongly stressed (+3.8 dB compared to IOI 13.1) and also considerably stronger 
than 16.1 (by a margin of 6.1 dB). I will not attempt to continue this MSE beyond 
measure 21, because the next potential beat, 22.1, also has an accent (a structural accent, 
in this case), and two strong beats cannot be adjacent in an MSE. Of the four beats 
in this MSE, the first and last are most strongly accented, so measures 14&ndash;19 can be 
considered to form a three-beat hypermeasure at level H<sub>2</sub> (Example 16a). Although it 
is tempting to consider this an expansion of the duple pattern found in the first MSE, this interpretation lacks a sufficient metrical context according to the criteria 
I have established, since the second MSE is not <i>directly</i> preceded by a duple MSE.<sup><a name="FN81REF" href="#FN81" id="footnote81">(81)</a></sup> 
A comparison of the two strong beats at H<sub>2</sub> in this MSE (i.e., 14.1 and 20.1) reveals 
a sufficient distinction to propose a third level of hypermeter here. As in the 
first MSE, the second of these two hyperbeats is stronger than the first on the 
basis of both AM and DM cues, and this yields an upbeat-downbeat figure at H<sub>3</sub>. 
(IOI 20.1 has 8.7% elongation and is ranked first among the even downbeats in measures 
1&ndash;20, while 14.1 has 3.1% elongation and is ranked sixth.)</p>

<p>[4.16] The remaining three recordings evince more stable MSEs than Britten&rsquo;s 
at the second and third hypermetric levels, and two of them (Marriner&rsquo;s and Bernstein&rsquo;s) 
include some tenable hypermetric transformations at the level H<sub>2</sub>. In Marriner&rsquo;s 
recording, the first MSE continues through measure 16 (<b>Example 17a</b>). Up to measure 10, it projects 
the same metrical pattern as Britten&rsquo;s recording (see Example 14), but in Marriner&rsquo;s 
version the alternation of strong and weak hyperbeats continues through 15.1. In 
terms of overall intensity, IOI 11.1 is louder than 9.1 (+7.6 dB) and likewise IOI 
15.1 is louder than 13.1 (+8.1 dB). The long crescendo in measures 12&ndash;15 adds further 
emphasis to 15.1, but it also obscures the relationship of 11.1 and 13.1 somewhat; 
nonetheless, 11.1 has a considerably longer elongation-style AM than 13.1 (35%, 
vs. 13%), so a strong-weak pattern is projected here. In Marriner&rsquo;s recording, the 
first MSE is twice as long as in Britten&rsquo;s recording, so we might expect that the 
third hypermetric level is somewhat more stable. Indeed, the hyperbeats at this 
level (i.e., 3.1, 7.1, 11.1, and 15.1) do evince a weak-strong-weak-strong pattern 
on the basis of their DMs (ranked sixth, fourth, seventh, and third, respectively, 
among odd-measure downbeats in measures 1&ndash;20). The resulting pattern can be interpreted 
as an upbeat, a full hypermeasure, and a downbeat (<b>Example 17b</b>). The first MSE ends 
at measure 16, because 17.1 is a strong beat (indeed, it has the loudest IOI in the excerpt) 
rather than the weak beat that we had come to expect. This strong beat belongs to 
another MSE at this level, which begins with a strong-weak-strong pattern among 
the next three hyperbeats, 17.1, 20.1, and 22.1 (<b>Example 17c</b>). As I mentioned above, 
the loudest downbeat in the passage is 17.1 in Marriner&rsquo;s recording, and 22.1 is 
a strong beat at this level because of the structural accent articulated by the 
return of tonic harmony.<sup><a name="FN82REF" href="#FN82" id="footnote82">(82)</a></sup> Because these metrical accents are caused by two different 
categories of accent cues, phenomenal and structural, it would be arbitrary to identify 
one as being stronger than the other, and furthermore I don&rsquo;t think either alternative 
would have much intuitive appeal. For both these reasons, I think it would be artificial 
to propose a third level of hypermeter for this MSE. It does, however, seem possible 
to combine the two MSEs at the second level into a single MSE, since they are adjacent 
and each contains at least one full duple measure. Because there is a sequence of 
two strong beats at their border (i.e., 15.1 and 17.1), we must use the Metrical 
Completion rule in order to regularize this pattern (<b>Example 17d</b>).</p>

<p>[4.17] Walter&rsquo;s interpretation is arguably the most stable of the six under consideration. 
On first hearing, we might consider the first MSE at H<sub>2</sub> to end in measure 10, as in Britten&rsquo;s recording. A pattern of alternating weak and strong hyperbeats seems to 
be established through DMs in 1.1, 3.1, 5.1, 7.1, and 9.1 (ranked tenth, fifth, 
ninth, third, and eighth among the odd-measure downbeats in measures 1&ndash;20), and this 
pattern seems to be disrupted by the presence of another weak beat at 11.1 (5.4 
dB quieter than IOI 13.1). If we consider 1.1 a strong beat, however, on the basis 
of its early position (see MPR 2), then a triple-meter pattern is established by 
measure 7, and this pattern continues uninterrupted through the entire excerpt (<b>Example 18a</b>). 
According to the latter interpretation, the first MSE of the piece ends at measure 21, 
because the structural accent at 22.1 would otherwise yield two adjacent strong 
beats (i.e., 20.1 and 22.1). The four strong beats in this MSE (1.1, 7.1, 13.1, 
and 20.1) are established as follows: 1.1 is strong because of its relatively early 
position (MPR 2); 7.1, because it is louder than the surrounding hyperbeats (5.1, 
7.1, and 9.1 are ranked ninth, third, and eighth); 13.1, because it is louder than 
the preceding hyperbeat (+5.4 dB) and has a greater elongation-style AM than the 
ensuing one (15.9%, vs. 6.0%); and 20.1, because it is the loudest beat in the entire 
excerpt. On the basis of both DMs and AMs, beats 7.1 and 20.1 are the strongest 
of these four beats (1.1, 7.1, 13.1, and 20.1 rank twentieth, fifth, eighth, and 
first in loudness among the twenty downbeats in the excerpt, and IOI 7.1 has the 
most pronounced AM in the excerpt, an elongation of 30.4% over IOI 6.1.) This creates 
a weak-strong-weak-strong pattern at H<sub>3</sub> (<b>Example 18b</b>). We might tentatively posit 
a fourth level here as well. It is difficult to choose between 7.1 and 20.1 on the 
basis of PMs, because 7.1 has the longest IOI in the excerpt and 20.1 the loudest. 
Nevertheless, the contrasts in texture, dynamics, and harmony that immediately follow 
20.1 make it seem the more salient of the two beats, so an upbeat-downbeat figure 
seems to be the more defensible choice (<b>Example 18c</b>). As we found in both MSEs of Britten&rsquo;s 
recording at level H<sub>3</sub>, the absence of a complete hypermeasure, combined with the 
extremely late position of the strong beat­this time at the downbeat of the twentieth 
measure out of twenty-one!­makes the H<sub>4</sub> interpretation here extremely fragile.</p>

<p>[4.18] As I mentioned previously, Bernstein&rsquo;s interpretation is nearly identical 
to Marriner&rsquo;s at level H<sub>1</sub>; they differ only in the nature of the transformation 
immediately preceding 20.1. As we shall see, however, the two interpretations diverge 
considerably at subsequent levels of MS. In Bernstein&rsquo;s version, the first MSE continues 
only to measure 10, because (as in Britten&rsquo;s recording) weak beats at level H<sub>2</sub> are 
found at both 9.1 and 11.1. The five beats in this MSE (i.e., the odd-measure downbeats 
in measures 1&ndash;10) are differentiated in a way that should by now seem familiar, that 
is, through an alternation of relatively weak and relatively strong DMs (<b>Example 19a</b>). 
(Beats 1.1, 3.1, 5.1, 7.1, and 9.1 are ranked tenth, fifth, seventh, fourth, and 
ninth among the odd-measure downbeats in measures 1&ndash;20.) Of the two strong beats in this MSE, 7.1 is the stronger, for it has a more pronounced AM and DM than 3.1. (IOI 
7.1 has 11.2% elongation at the beat level, vs. 5.9% in IOI 3.1, and the PSL in 
IOI 7.1 is 2.8 dB louder than in IOI 3.1). Thus, the first MSE has an upbeat-downbeat 
figure at H<sub>3</sub>, much like the one found in Britten&rsquo;s recording (<b>Example 19b</b>). The weak 
beat at 11.1 initiates a second MSE (measures 11&ndash;21), which also has an alternation of 
weak and strong hyperbeats (<b>Example 19c</b>). The differentiation of 11.1 and 13.1 is clear 
on the basis of their DMs (ranked fourteenth and eighth among the downbeats in measures 
1&ndash;20), as is the differentiation of 15.1, 17.1, 19.1, and 20.1 (ranked fifth, first, 
third, and second). Also note that, although IOI 13.1 is quieter than 15.1, the 
latter is less strongly delineated at the beat-to-beat level; whereas IOI 13.1 is 
louder than 12.2 (+1.0 dB), 15.1 is somewhat quieter than 14.2 (-0.8 dB). Among 
beats 13.1, 17.1, and 20.1, the three strong beats in the second MSE, the one with 
the loudest IOI is 17.1, so a weak-strong-weak pattern might be inferred at 
level H3 (<b>Example 19d</b>).</p>

<p>[4.19] Both MSEs in Bernstein&rsquo;s recording have duple meter at level H<sub>2</sub>, and 
two weak beats are adjacent at the border between the two. This interpretation can 
therefore be transformed to a regular, well-formed MSE spanning the entire 
excerpt through the Metrical Contraction rule (<b>Example 20a</b>). This transformation also yields 
a well-formed MSE at level H<sub>3</sub>, consisting of an upbeat and two full duple measures 
(<b>Example 20b</b>). Although these two hypermeasures are conceptually equal in length, the 
spans of the musical surface to which they correspond (i.e., measures 7&ndash;16 and 17&ndash;21) 
are radically different in length­they cover ten and five measures, respectively. (Incidentally, 
this progressive shortening is also evident at the level of the hyperbeats in these 
measures, which span six, four, three, and two measures.) This asymmetry might influence 
our choice between 7.1 and 17.1 at level H<sub>4</sub>. Beat 17.1 is clearly the louder of 
the two (by a margin of 13.2 dB), and it also has a salient hesitation-style AM 
(10.5% at the beat-to-beat level), while 7.1 has an elongation-style AM (11.2%). 
Although 17.1 would appear to be the stronger beat on the basis of these PM cues, 
this does not seem to be an intuitively justifiable reading. It seems that the extremely 
wide spacing of these hyperbeats diminishes the force of PM comparisons. Instead, 
7.1 seems like the stronger beat (see <b>Example 20c</b>), and this reading is supported by 
the asymmetry between the portions of the musical surface corresponding to the two hyperbeats (see 
<a href="#Appendix3">Appendix 3</a>, MPR 5a) and also by the tendency to hear the earlier 
of two more-or-less equally accented beats as the strong beat (MPR 2). </p>
<p>[4.20] As we have seen, each of the six interpretations under consideration employs 
a different set of hypermetric transformations and thus conveys a different version 
of the work. Some might find the diversity among these six interpretations unsettling, 
and might consider the absence of criteria for determining which is the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; 
or &ldquo;intended&rdquo; version to be a shortcoming of the procedure I have developed. To 
this objection, I would respond that, like the Gestalt theorists and like Lerdahl 
and Jackendoff, I am interested in understanding structural intuitions without recourse 
to idealism. In focusing on general principles of perception and on conventions 
for the projection of meter, I have attempted to sidestep the problematic metaphysical 
assumption that the work itself is timeless and fully determined prior to any performance 
of it, an assumption that is often implicit in critical discourse on the relative 
merits of different interpretations. Instead of imagining an ideal performance, 
I prefer to use hypothetical, metrically regular abstractions inferred from the 
interaction of score and performance as the framework for comparing interpretations. 
In order to use these comparisons to support an argument about the merit of a recording, 
we would need to postulate specific criteria for critical evaluation. For instance, 
if we decide that symmetry is important, then we might argue that Britten&rsquo;s performance 
is outstanding because of the parallelism between the two MSEs in his version of 
the Mozart excerpt at levels H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>3</sub> (see Examples 15 
and 16). If we value musical 
humor, then we might instead prefer Walter&rsquo;s interpretation, because of the thwarted 
expectancy at level H<sub>1</sub> in his recording (see Example 12). While this approach to criticism 
might be interesting, it is important to realize that the comparisons enabled by 
my adaptations to the Lerdahl-Jackendoff theory are, in themselves, non-judgmental.</p>
<h3>[5] Rethinking the Role of Performance in the Lerdahl-Jackendoff Theory</h3>
<p>[5.1] If Lerdahl and Jackendoff are correct in characterizing the Mozart example 
discussed in Part 4 as &ldquo;a not untypically complex passage&rdquo; with regard to Metrical 
Structure, then it would appear that their &ldquo;balance-tipping&rdquo; analogy, which I quoted 
previously (see paragraph 2.4), is in need of some refinement. The expression &ldquo;tip 
the balance&rdquo; implies that performance-specific features are considered relatively 
late in the analytic process, if at all, after an impasse is reached in the interpretation 
of a score. That is, in conducting an analysis, we first study the score, and in 
doing so we discover something that resembles the faces/vase illusion, so we then 
listen to a recording, and finally decide on a preferred reading. Because the Lerdahl-Jackendoff 
theory is intended first and foremost to depict the <i>listener&rsquo;s</i> intuitions, I believe 
this sequence of events is inappropriate. By beginning with the details of performances 
in an ambiguous passage, I have shown that more than two different interpretations 
can be conveyed, and that these interpretations are not necessarily the ones that 
are the most obvious on the basis of the score. The potential multivalence of a 
musical structure is sometimes more extravagant than a score-reader can anticipate; 
some passages are more like mosaics than faces/vase illusions in the range of meanings 
they can evoke (see Example 1b, j). I therefore suggest that we begin our revision to 
the schematic representation of the &ldquo;balance-tipping&rdquo; model by extending the number 
of possible interpretations indefinitely (<b>Example 21</b>). </p>

<p>[5.2] To me, the score-reader&rsquo;s inability to predict a performer&rsquo;s interpretation 
in no way indicates a lack of musical intuition, but instead reflects elite performers&rsquo; 
uncanny ability to avoid sounding predictable, an ability that involves a combination 
of intuition and conscious thought. <i>GTTM</i> goes a long way toward formalizing 
intuition, but it makes no allowance for the influence a performer&rsquo;s unpredictable, 
conscious decisions can have on an experienced listener&rsquo;s intuitions­indeed, Lerdahl 
and Jackendoff regard the performer&rsquo;s construction of an interpretation as a &ldquo;largely 
unconscious&rdquo; process.<sup><a name="FN83REF" href="#FN83" id="footnote83">(83)</a></sup> An influential study by psychologist Caroline Palmer provides 
a different perspective. In a series of experiments on the performance of works 
with ambiguous phrase structures, Palmer examines correlations between pianists&rsquo; 
score annotations and SYVAR patterns that are conventionally used to communicate 
interpretations of phrase structure.<sup><a name="FN84REF" href="#FN84" id="footnote84">(84)</a></sup> Each pianist&rsquo;s annotations suggest a different 
structural interpretation, and that interpretation corresponds strongly and uniquely 
to SYVARs in that individual&rsquo;s performance. Palmer&rsquo;s experiment suggests a model 
of the relationship between ambiguous notation and the sounding musical surface 
(see <b>Example 22a</b>) that is quite different from, but not incompatible with, the model 
implied by Lerdahl and Jackendoff through their balance-tipping analogy (see 
Example 6b&ndash;c). Palmer&rsquo;s model allows maximum room for the performer&rsquo;s freedom of conscious 
interpretation, and thus it sheds light on exceptions to Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
assumption that performing nuance arises largely from unconscious interpretation. 
Thus, we might further revise our schematic representation of the balance-tipping 
phenomenon by adding conscious interpretation as an intermediate stage between the 
intuitive understanding of hierarchical structures and the application of SYVARs 
(<b>Example 22b</b>). A limited form of conscious thought (i.e., preference between two equally 
legitimate options) was already implicit in Example 4, but Palmer&rsquo;s model allows us 
to expand this considerably to include whatever musical (and even extramusical) 
considerations seem relevant. </p>
<p>[5.3] Throughout this paper, I have attempted to follow Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s 
lead in theorizing aspects of comprehensibility and remaining silent on aesthetic 
issues such as, for instance, the thwarting of expectancies or the representation 
of affect, motion, or aspects of a narrative. Although I would not deny that many 
of the SYVARs that expert performers use are based on aesthetic considerations such 
as these, rather than the straightforward projection of an intuitive, stable structural 
interpretation, I nevertheless see the value in examining aesthetically motivated 
idiosyncrasies in contradistinction to norms associated with intelligibility. In 
the realm of linguistics, Noam Chomsky theorized grammatical norms under the rubric 
of &ldquo;competence&rdquo; and referred to the relationship between actual utterances and these 
norms, including errors and ambiguities, as &ldquo;performance.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN85REF" href="#FN85" id="footnote85">(85)</a></sup> In its inclusion 
of a place for performers&rsquo; diverse conscious interpretative decisions, many of which 
(hopefully) will be motivated by aesthetic considerations rather than purely matters 
of musical syntax, the schematic model I have developed might be useful in the development 
of a theory of musical &ldquo;performance,&rdquo; in Chomsky&rsquo;s sense of the term.<sup><a name="FN86REF" href="#FN86" id="footnote86">(86)</a></sup></p>
<p>[5.4] If <i>GTTM</i> were designed as a reading theory rather than a listening 
theory, or if the Mozart example possessed an exceptionally high degree of metrical 
complexity, then it might be argued that the scheme I am suggesting places too much 
emphasis on seemingly superficial performing nuances at the expense of more powerful 
score-based elements. I would answer this objection by reiterating three crucial 
facts: (1) the theory is clearly intended to capture the experienced listener&rsquo;s 
intuitions, so the aural stimulus rather than the score is the more suitable object 
of inquiry, (2) Lerdahl and Jackendoff suggest that the Mozart example has an unexceptional 
degree of metrical complexity, and (3) elsewhere Lerdahl suggests that salience 
conditions become increasingly important to the listener&rsquo;s construction of hierarchical 
interpretations in cases where stability is compromised, and in my view this should 
include violations to MWFR 4, the rule that insists on evenly spaced beats at the 
tactus and immediately larger metrical levels. I would also point out once again 
that, in simpler metrical situations that adhere to MWFR 4 at the first few levels 
of hypermeter, skilled performers and (other) readers should be expected to agree 
on their interpretations of the score. In the case of an unambiguous structure, 
therefore, the differences among performances become less relevant, and the score 
can adequately serve as an substitute for a conventional performance (see 
Example 6a).</p>
<p>[5.5] I will conclude by mentioning a few ways in which the concepts I have discussed 
might be developed further. Under close examination, recordings of additional hypermetrically 
ambiguous passages would no doubt prompt refinements to the metrical transformation 
rules that I proposed in Part 4. The utility of the metrical transformation rules 
at the level of local meter might also be assessed, using examples from non-Western 
and twentieth-century repertories in which temporal organization lies in the grey 
area between the random and the perfectly regular (e.g., changing meters). It is 
also important to remember that Metrical Structure is one of four interdependent 
parameters of hierarchical organization theorized in <i>GTTM</i>, and it remains 
to be seen whether the metrical transformations I have described would have effects 
on the other parameters.<sup><a name="FN87REF" href="#FN87" id="footnote87">(87)</a></sup> It might also be interesting to explore the effects 
of performing nuance within each of the other parameters of the theory. In particular, 
the projection of phrase-periodic structure and, more recently, the communication 
of patterns of musical tension in performance have been studied extensively by music 
psychologists, and this research would inform an examination of the role of performance 
in the communication of phrase-periodic structure and patterns of tension and relaxation, 
parameters that Lerdahl and Jackendoff cover under the rubric of Grouping Structure 
(GS) and Prolongational Reduction (PR), respectively.<sup><a name="FN88REF" href="#FN88" id="footnote88">(88)</a></sup> The techniques for SYVAR 
analysis that I outline in Part 4 might also help in the development of analytical 
applications for the copious insights on performance that are found in more recent 
texts on meter, such as Jonathan Kramer&rsquo;s <i>The Time of Music</i>, William Rothstein&rsquo;s 
<i>Phrase Rhythm in Tonal Music</i>, and Christopher Hasty&rsquo;s <i>Meter as Rhythm</i>. Indeed, 
any structuralist theory that purports to illuminate the listening experience should 
have room for considering the impact of performing nuance, and performance analysis 
seems especially useful in exploring the inner workings of ambiguous structures.</p>

<h3><a name="Appendix2"></a>[7] Appendix 2. Performance Analysis Techniques</h3>
<p>[7.1] Before I begin explaining some basic techniques for the analysis of duration 
and loudness in recordings, I must once again emphasize that the process should 
begin with close listening unmediated by a computer. This helps us avoid attributing 
importance to distinctions that are too fine for the ear to detect under normal 
listening conditions.</p>
<p>[7.2] When a performer is present as an experimental subject, a computer interface 
with the instrument can allow the researcher to gather data very efficiently, but 
data collection is rather more arduous in the case of a recorded performance. At 
present, there are three basic options for the analysis of recordings: tapping software, 
spectrographic analysis, and audio editing software (sometimes referred to as waveform 
analysis). In the first of these approaches, the listener taps along with the perceived 
beat of the performance, from which the computer calculates rough data on tempo 
fluctuation.<sup><a name="FN91REF" href="#FN91" id="footnote91">(91)</a></sup> This is the most efficient method for gathering data, and the only 
realistic method for analyzing complete large-scale works or movements or for making 
general comparisons of a large number of recordings. However, it is limited to the 
parameter of tempo, and even in this capacity it is considerably less accurate than 
the other forms of analysis. Spectrographic analysis, the second approach, is especially 
useful for gathering information on timbre.<sup><a name="FN92REF" href="#FN92" id="footnote92">(92)</a></sup> This is the preferred method for 
dealing with orchestral instruments and the human voice (in both live and recorded 
performances), but it requires cumbersome (and expensive) hardware and a greater 
knowledge of acoustics and mathematics than many music theorists possess (including 
the present author). This leaves waveform analysis, in which excerpts from an LP 
or a CD are converted to digital sound files (e.g., .au or .wav) and analyzed with 
audio editing software.<sup><a name="FN93REF" href="#FN93" id="footnote93">(93)</a></sup> This method is more accurate than the tapping approach 
and more user-friendly than the spectrographic, and it can provide reliable information 
pertaining to loudness and (especially) duration.</p>
<p>[7.3] Once the excerpt has been converted to a sound file, its waveform can be 
displayed in an audio editing program, and playback can be initiated from any point, 
with a resolution greater than 1 ms (millisecond).<sup><a name="FN94REF" href="#FN94" id="footnote94">(94)</a></sup> (I prefer Syntrillium CoolEdit, 
a Shareware program that I have found to be reliable and user-friendly. WaveLab 
and ProTools are other popular options.) Through a combination of visual and aural 
observation, one can identify the temporal location of the onset (beginning) of 
any event, such as a solid chord or an unaccompanied melody note. By using this 
method, the durations of inter-onset intervals (IOIs) can be calculated at the level 
of the phrase, measure, beat, or (in some cases) individual note. Some precision 
is lost in cases where reverb or chord asynchrony makes it difficult to pinpoint 
the onset, and human error should also be taken into consideration. If pressed, 
I would estimate the reliability to be no worse than ±20 ms. In general, I like 
to gather IOI statistics at the level of the tactus, that is, the metrical level 
that is most salient to the listener (and the performer) and that sometimes provokes 
toe-tapping. These values can easily be converted to M.M. speeds in beats per minute 
(bpm). </p>
<p>[7.4] Amplitude is the main physical correlate of intensity, or perceived loudness. 
The human ear can perceive intensity distinctions across a trillion-fold spectrum, 
so a logarithmic measure, the decibel (dB), is used to facilitate comparisons. Regardless 
of their absolute values, any two sounds at the same pitch level that differ in 
amplitude by 10 dB (e.g., 0 dB and 10 dB, 90 dB and 100 dB) will have intensities 
in a 10:1 ratio. The same is not true of linear measures, such as duration, which 
is one reason why we sometimes use percentages rather than absolute durational values 
when comparing IOIs. Note that the logarithmic function is curved, so the intensity 
ratio is not always equal to the difference in dB values. In fact, it is only so 
in the case of 10 dB differences. However, a useful rule of thumb is that a 3 dB 
difference roughly indicates a doubling in intensity.<sup><a name="FN95REF" href="#FN95" id="footnote95">(95)</a></sup></p>
<p>[7.5] It is important to realize that two different scales are in common use 
among those interested in measuring the loudness of music. One is called &ldquo;Sound Pressure Level&rdquo; 
(SPL), and in this case the baseline (0 dB) represents the normal threshold of hearing 
(i.e., minimum audible intensity) for pitches around 1000 Hz. This scale is used 
for comparing sounds &ldquo;in the air.&rdquo; The other scale, &ldquo;Electronic Signal Level&rdquo; (ESL), 
instead uses the point at which distortion is attenuated as its baseline. The latter 
scale is used for most forms of electronically mediated sound, including audio editing 
software. Those who are accustomed to seeing amplitudes in terms of SPL scales, 
according to which most musical performances fall somewhere between 40 and 90 dB, 
might be surprised by the readings given by audio editing software, which (if distortion 
is successfully avoided) fall entirely below 0 dB. Most CD recordings, for example, 
have ESLs between ­90 dB and 0 dB.</p>
<p>[7.6] It should also be noted that, unlike IOIs, absolute intensity values are 
meaningless in themselves as measures of a performance, because they are dependent 
upon recording and playback levels.<sup><a name="FN96REF" href="#FN96" id="footnote96">(96)</a></sup> In performance analysis, it is best to concentrate 
on relative intensities within any given recording. The most useful approach that 
the current technology enables appears to be the ranking of selected events in terms 
of loudness. In order to maximize the effectiveness of this, the excerpt should 
be edited so that the loudest event is amplified to just under 0 dB<sub>ESL</sub> and all 
other values are amplified proportionally. This process, which can be carried out 
automatically using the audio editor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Normalize&rdquo; function, widens the range of 
amplitudes and thus facilitates comparisons. Even if we restrict ourselves to the 
ranking of relative intensities, caution is required in interpreting amplitude data, 
since the relationship between amplitude and perceived loudness is extremely complex. Intensity rises in proportion to frequency in the case of isolated pitches, and 
also in proportion to textural density,<sup><a name="FN97REF" href="#FN97" id="footnote97">(97)</a></sup> so it would be simplistic to regard 
a quantitative change in intensity <i>as</i> a change in loudness. For this reason, it 
is safest to compare intensity levels in the case of events that are qualitatively 
similar in terms of parameters other than perceived loudness. Fortunately, significant 
changes in orchestration occur only three times in the excerpt used in this study 
(at beats 14.1, 16.2, and 20.2), and the frequency range is relatively small (e.g., 
the melody lies within the span of a tenth), but in music with a greater variety 
of orchestration or pitch, intensity values would be less useful measures of loudness, 
even for the purpose of ranking the dynamic levels of selected beats.</p>
<p>[7.7] Audio editing software can automatically compute the peak sound level (PSL) 
within any portion of an audio file.<sup><a name="FN98REF" href="#FN98" id="footnote98">(98)</a></sup> First, as I have just explained, the entire 
excerpt should be edited using the &ldquo;Normalize&rdquo; function. Next, the PSL data can 
be collected for any span of music. Depending on the objective, it might be appropriate 
to examine each beat (using the onset points located previously as guides), or even 
each note within passages whose dynamics or accents seem to be of particular interest. 
Unfortunately, existing technology does not allow us to analyze each voice in a 
multi-voice texture independently. It is possible to define frequency limits to 
the analysis (e.g., to analyze the amplitudes for frequencies between 40 Hz and 
1000 Hz), but such an approach would discount the contribution of overtones to the 
perceived intensity of each pitch. </p>

<h3>[b] Mozart/Marriner, I, mm. 1-20</h3>
<p>There is an interesting contrapuntal-temporal effect in this performance. In 
mm. 1-11, where the melody has a rest on the second beat of each odd-numbered 
measure, the bass articulates the beat later than expected, but nevertheless the 
ensuing melody note comes in &quot;on time.&quot; Values shown are estimates of the 
virtual melody onset, an approximation based on the onsets of the second and 
fourth quarter-note subdivisions of these measures. The bass onsets for these 
beats are, respectively:&nbsp; 0.564, 2.956, 5.028, 7.283, 9.415, and 11.729 s. 
PSLs here are based on bass onsets, but IOIs are based on the virtual melody 
onsets. </p>

both &ldquo;analyzing the piece,&rdquo; which is vague, and &ldquo;score-based analysis,&rdquo; which 
overemphasizes the visual aspect of the activity. Whether we are dealing with 
words or music, the word &ldquo;reading&rdquo; carries the connotations of aural imagery and 
creative participation in an often silent, private performance of sorts. In a 
subtle way, the word &ldquo;reading&rdquo; emphasizes the analyst&rsquo;s participation in the 
construction of the object of study. As Nicholas Cook once remarked, &ldquo;when 
musicians use the notation for the purposes it is intended for&mdash;when, that is, 
they read it&mdash;they supply a great deal of information which is not actually in

significant differences in performers&rsquo; treatment of alternate metrical renderings 
of a melody. These are summarized in Sloboda, &ldquo;Expressive Skill in Two 
Pianists,&rdquo; 290&ndash;91. Sloboda used a metronome 
in his experiment, which might account for the relatively insignificant appearance 
of AMs in his study. Clarke did not use a metronome, and perhaps consequently, his 
study reveals more convincing results pertaining to AMs. See especially Clarke, 
&ldquo;Generative Principles,&rdquo; 11&ndash;14. It would seem that a further implication of Sloboda&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s studies 
is that Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s omission of time signatures and barlines from their 
analyses of MS is an unnecessary precaution. If the performer uses PM cues that 
lie within the listener&rsquo;s scope of experience, then the performance essentially 
makes the time signatures and barlines audible. The only type of performance that 
corresponds to their unmeasured notation would be a computer-generated mechanically 
regular performance.<br><a href="#FN64REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN65">65.</a> Listeners vary greatly in their ability to decipher

the difference (0.24 dB) lies below the threshold of discrimination. This discrepancy 
can be attributed to the fact that amplitude stats fail to differentiate between 
the contributions of the melody and accompaniment. In this case, the lower strings 
seem to be playing measure 10 more intensely than measure 11, probably because of local harmonic 
tension and resolution. I would argue that the salient DM in the melody is more 
relevant to a discussion of Walter&rsquo;s MS interpretation. The accent at 13.1 also

PMs, no doubt largely because their subjects were pianists and the piano timbre 
cannot normally be controlled independently of dynamic level. Sloboda and 
Clarke also describe substitutions such as these. They identify some SYVARs

are considered weak beats. While my interpretation of Britten&rsquo;s recording is based 
mainly on <i>phenomenal</i> accents, Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s interpretation of the score 
is based on the effect of the <i>structural</i> accents articulated by the arrival of 
dominant and tonic harmonies at measures 16 and 20, respectively. Because of the relative 
obscurity of this hypermetrical level after measure 10, I would speculate that the choice 
between these two possible MSE interpretations for this recording of the piece will 
depend on whether the listener happens to be attending more closely to harmonic 
cues or to PMs. As explained in the passage from <i>GTTM</i> quoted above (paragraph 
3.2), both phenomenal and structural accents can serve as cues for the construction 
of metrical accents. See also <i>GTTM</i>, 30&ndash;35.<br><a href="#FN81REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN82">82.</a> Note that this MSE comes very close to the one mentioned by Lerdahl and Jackendoff.

the &ldquo;competence/performance&rdquo; dichotomy directly to music and to address only competence 
in their theory, it should by now be clear that a sharp distinction between the 
terms of this dichotomy is somewhat unconvinving in the case of music (or, for that 
matter, any performing art). For example, musical competence includes, in addition 
to the factors addressed in <i>GTTM</i>, an understanding of performers&rsquo; SYVARs, 
and conversely musical performance often involves the clarification of ambiguous 
musical structures. A full exploration of this problem, which goes much further

words or music, the word &ldquo;reading&rdquo; carries the connotations of aural imagery and 
creative participation in an often silent, private performance of sorts. In a 
subtle way, the word &ldquo;reading&rdquo; emphasizes the analyst&rsquo;s participation in the 
construction of the object of study. As Nicholas Cook once remarked, &ldquo;when 
musicians use the notation for the purposes it is intended for&mdash;when, that is, 
they read it&mdash;they supply a great deal of information which is not actually in

&ldquo;Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems,&rdquo; in <i>Generative Processes in 
Musi</i>c, 
ed. Sloboda, 231&ndash;59.</div><div id="fndiv53" class="flyoverdiv">More recently, a consensus has emerged that formalism 
can be divorced from idealism by considering the latter to be nothing more than 
a useful fiction. This postmodern ideology has sometimes been referred to as 
&ldquo;provisional autonomy.&rdquo; For a passionate defense of it, see Leo Treitler, &ldquo;The Historiography of Music: 
Issues of Past and Present,&rdquo; in <i>Rethinking Musi</i>c, ed. Nicholas Cook and Mark Everist, 
356&ndash;77 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 358.</div><div id="fndiv54" class="flyoverdiv">I do not mean to imply that Gestalt psychology is free 
of ideological baggage, but merely that it successfully evades the influence of 
neo-Platonic idealism and the aesthetic tradition associated with it. Indeed, 
the view that perceptual experience can be explained independently of 
socio-historical factors is itself the product of a specifically modernist 
socio-historical milieu. See Mitchell G. Ash, &ldquo;The Academic Environment and the 
Establishment of Experimental Psychology,&rdquo; in <i>Gestalt Psychology in German Culture, 1890&ndash;1967: Holism and 
the Quest for Objectivit</i>y, 17&ndash;27 (Cambridge: 
Cambridge University Press, 1995).</div><div id="fndiv55" class="flyoverdiv">In his influential publications in the 1930s, music 
psychologist Carl E. Seashore conceived performance expression as departures 
from a mechanically regular norm. See Seashore, <i>Psychology of Musi</i>c (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1938), 29&ndash;30. This approach 
was later taken up at Uppsala by Ingmar Bengtsson and his colleagues, who coined 
the term SYVAR. See Ingmar Bengtsson and Alf Gabrielsson, &ldquo;Analysis and 
Synthesis of Musical Rhythm,&rdquo; in <i>Studies of Music Performanc</i>e, ed. Johann Sundberg, 27&ndash;59 
(Stockholm: Royal Swedish Academy of Music, 1983).</div><div id="fndiv56" class="flyoverdiv">In this paper, I am adhering to Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s policy of theorizing 
aspects of comprehensibility rather than aesthetics. See <i>GTTM</i>, 7&ndash;8, as well 
as paragraph 5.3, below.</div><div id="fndiv57" class="flyoverdiv">I do not mean to suggest that performances are 
entirely unambiguous in meaning, or that performers never introduce additional 
ambiguities by their ironic handling of structures that seem unequivocal on the 
basis of the score. Intriguing as such phenomena may be, I will instead focus on 
situations in which performing nuances seem to eliminate, or at least mitigate, 
some of the ambiguities found in scores.</div><div id="fndiv58" class="flyoverdiv">Lerdahl, &ldquo;Atonal Prolongational Structure,&rdquo; <i>Contemporary Music Revie</i>w 4 (1989),

&ldquo;Generative Principles.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv64" class="flyoverdiv">Sloboda found six types of cues that accounted for 82% of the statistically 
significant differences in performers&rsquo; treatment of alternate metrical renderings 
of a melody. These are summarized in Sloboda, &ldquo;Expressive Skill in Two 
Pianists,&rdquo; 290&ndash;91. Sloboda used a metronome 
in his experiment, which might account for the relatively insignificant appearance 
of AMs in his study. Clarke did not use a metronome, and perhaps consequently, his 
study reveals more convincing results pertaining to AMs. See especially Clarke, 
&ldquo;Generative Principles,&rdquo; 11&ndash;14. It would seem that a further implication of Sloboda&rsquo;s and Clarke&rsquo;s studies 
is that Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s omission of time signatures and barlines from their 
analyses of MS is an unnecessary precaution. If the performer uses PM cues that 
lie within the listener&rsquo;s scope of experience, then the performance essentially 
makes the time signatures and barlines audible. The only type of performance that 
corresponds to their unmeasured notation would be a computer-generated mechanically 
regular performance.</div><div id="fndiv65" class="flyoverdiv">Listeners vary greatly in their ability to decipher 
performers&rsquo; metrical cues, including DMs and AMs, but these differences appear to be proportionate to the extent 
of listeners&rsquo; musical experience. See Sloboda, &ldquo;The Communication of Musical 
Metre,&rdquo; 393.</div><div id="fndiv66" class="flyoverdiv">Compare nos. 3 and 5 under the &ldquo;General Discussion&rdquo; in Sloboda,

completion given in paragraph 4.8 apply specifically to duple-meter contexts. 
Further transformational rules could readily be constructed to account for 
similar phenomena in the context of a prevailing triple meter. According to Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s MWFR3, duple and triple meter 
are the only allowable well-formed metrical structures in Western tonal music.</div><div id="fndiv72" class="flyoverdiv">See also paragraph 2.7, above. Like the authors of <i>GTTM</i>, I will refrain 
from speculating on the temporality of the cognitive process of metrical transformation. 
For a preliminary exploration of real-time cognitive processing of music, informed 
by research on listeners&rsquo; parsing of language, see Ray Jackendoff, &ldquo;Musical Parsing 
and Musical Affect,&rdquo; <i>Music Perception</i> 9/2 (Winter 1991): 199&ndash;230.</div><div id="fndiv73" class="flyoverdiv">See <a target='_self' href='#Appendix2'>Appendix 2</a> for an explanation of the terms I use in reference to the quantitative performance analyses.</div><div id="fndiv74" class="flyoverdiv">According to the amplitude statistics, IOI 10.1 is louder than 11.1, although 
the difference (0.24 dB) lies below the threshold of discrimination. This discrepancy 
can be attributed to the fact that amplitude stats fail to differentiate between 
the contributions of the melody and accompaniment. In this case, the lower strings 
seem to be playing measure 10 more intensely than measure 11, probably because of local harmonic 
tension and resolution. I would argue that the salient DM in the melody is more 
relevant to a discussion of Walter&rsquo;s MS interpretation. The accent at 13.1 also 
seems to be confounded by this effect.</div><div id="fndiv75" class="flyoverdiv">See also MPR 2 (<i>GTTM</i>, 347), included in my 
<a href='#Appendix1'>Appendix 1</a>.</div><div id="fndiv76" class="flyoverdiv">Actually, 11.1 is a full 2.6 dB quieter than 10.1, but 
this reflects only the net intensity, not the melodic accent. Sloboda and Clarke don&rsquo;t propose timbre-related 
PMs, no doubt largely because their subjects were pianists and the piano timbre 
cannot normally be controlled independently of dynamic level. Sloboda and 
Clarke also describe substitutions such as these. They identify some SYVARs 
in different parameters of performance that project the same aspect of a metrical 
interpretation. See especially Clarke, &ldquo;Generative Principles,&rdquo; 14; Sloboda, 
&ldquo;The Communication of Musical Metre,&rdquo; 394; and Sloboda, &ldquo;Expressive Skill in Two 
Pianists,&rdquo; 292.</div><div id="fndiv77" class="flyoverdiv"><i>GTTM</i>, 25.</div><div id="fndiv78" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid.</div><div id="fndiv79" class="flyoverdiv">Again, the intensity data here can be a bit 
misleading. In all voices combined, 5.1 is louder than 3.1 by a margin of 0.8 
dB, but this measure does not capture melodic accents.</div><div id="fndiv80" class="flyoverdiv"><i>GTTM</i>, 347. See also <a target='_self' href='#Appendix1'>Appendix 1</a>.</div><div id="fndiv81" class="flyoverdiv">Also note that this interpretation conflicts with the 
score-based interpretation offered by Lerdahl and Jackendoff (my Example 14 [<a target='ex_window' href='ex14_djvu.html'>DjVu</a>] [<a target='ex_window' href='ex14.html'>GIF</a>]), in which 20.1 and presumably 14.1 
are considered weak beats. While my interpretation of Britten&rsquo;s recording is based 
mainly on <i>phenomenal</i> accents, Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s interpretation of the score 
is based on the effect of the <i>structural</i> accents articulated by the arrival of 
dominant and tonic harmonies at measures 16 and 20, respectively. Because of the relative 
obscurity of this hypermetrical level after measure 10, I would speculate that the choice 
between these two possible MSE interpretations for this recording of the piece will 
depend on whether the listener happens to be attending more closely to harmonic 
cues or to PMs. As explained in the passage from <i>GTTM</i> quoted above (paragraph 
3.2), both phenomenal and structural accents can serve as cues for the construction 
of metrical accents. See also <i>GTTM</i>, 30&ndash;35.</div><div id="fndiv82" class="flyoverdiv">Note that this MSE comes very close to the one mentioned by Lerdahl and Jackendoff. 
Marriner&rsquo;s first hyperbeat occurs a measure later than the one shown in Example 14 [<a target='ex_window' href='ex14_djvu.html'>DjVu</a>] [<a target='ex_window' href='ex14.html'>GIF</a>], however, and a transformation at level H1 makes the MSE a two-beat rather than a three-beat hypermeasure at level H2.</div><div id="fndiv83" class="flyoverdiv"><i>GTTM</i>, 63.</div><div id="fndiv84" class="flyoverdiv">Palmer, &ldquo;Mapping Musical Thought,&rdquo; refers to the principles summarized in 
Clarke, &ldquo;Generative Principles,&rdquo; but neither adopts nor refutes Clarke&rsquo;s idea of considering <i>GTTM</i> an &ldquo;input&rdquo; to the generation 
of a performance. Note also that Palmer does not explore the pianists&rsquo; hypermetric 
interpretation, so the relationship between her findings and my study is rather 
tangential. Nevertheless, Palmer clearly demonstrates a situation where the performer&rsquo;s 
conscious intentions have a marked effect on the perception of an ambiguous structure.</div><div id="fndiv85" class="flyoverdiv">See Noam Chomsky, <i>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 
1965), 4.</div><div id="fndiv86" class="flyoverdiv">I should also mention that, although Lerdahl and Jackendoff attempt to transpose 
the &ldquo;competence/performance&rdquo; dichotomy directly to music and to address only competence 
in their theory, it should by now be clear that a sharp distinction between the 
terms of this dichotomy is somewhat unconvinving in the case of music (or, for that 
matter, any performing art). For example, musical competence includes, in addition 
to the factors addressed in <i>GTTM</i>, an understanding of performers&rsquo; SYVARs, 
and conversely musical performance often involves the clarification of ambiguous 
musical structures. A full exploration of this problem, which goes much further 
than nomenclature, would, no doubt, require a separate article.</div><div id="fndiv87" class="flyoverdiv"><i>GTTM</i>, 10; Lerdahl and Jackendoff, &ldquo;Reply to 
Peel and Slawson,&rdquo; 147.</div><div id="fndiv88" class="flyoverdiv">See especially Palmer, &ldquo;Mapping Musical Thought&rdquo;; William E. Frederickson 
and Christopher M. Johnson, &ldquo;The Effect of Performer Use of Rubato on Listener 
Perception of Tension in Mozart,&rdquo; <i>Psychomusicology</i> 15 (1996): 78&ndash;86. Lerdahl&rsquo;s more recent work on pitch 
space, which is closely related to Prolongational Reduction, is widely discussed 
in <i>Music Perception</i> 13/3 (Spring 1996), a special issue on musical tension that 
includes much fodder for further performance-related research.</div><div id="fndiv89" class="flyoverdiv">This appendix includes all the rules pertaining to MS 
in the Rules Index of
<i>GTTM</i>. See <i>GTTM</i>, 347&ndash;48. Also included are the new preference rules 
and transformational rules that I am proposing, with paragraph references.</div><div id="fndiv90" class="flyoverdiv">Lerdahl and Jackendoff claim that all their MS rules except MWFR3 and MWFR4 
apply to all musical traditions. Note that I have made no such claims with regard 
to the performance-related rules, all of which I consider to be specific to the 
Western art-music tradition.</div><div id="fndiv91" class="flyoverdiv">For example, Jos&eacute; A. Bowen, &ldquo;A Computer-Aided Study of 
Conducting,&rdquo; <i>Computing in Musicology</i>
