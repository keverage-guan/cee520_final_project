<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Just a little bit of theory can create a good deal of anxiety. Throughout its modern disciplinary history, American music theory has maintained a predilection for meta-theoretical critique, often shrouded in any number of assorted anxieties. Unity, prolongation, organicism, and symmetry have each garnered their share of attention in music-theoretical meta-discourse, even as these very concepts continue to make up the heart of analytical methods still employed (sometimes uncritically) in contemporary scholarship. The recent debate in <i>Music Theory Online</i> over the nature and efficacy of Klumpenhouwer Networks (hereafter, K-nets) in the analysis of post-tonal music is representative of and, indeed, instructive in its engagement with methodological anxiety.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2] In four short meditations, I will engage implicit ideological frameworks 
articulated by various positions in the K-net debate, problematizing their 
assumptions and qualifying their proposals for further research. The recent 
dialogue on K-nets has left some properties of the analytical system unexplored 
and some aspects of the analytical process undertheorized. It is my contention 
that both sides in the K-net debate make recourse to a &#8220;musical surface&#8221; that has received insufficient critical attention. Directly engaging this concept, I will suggest ways in which future work on K-nets might proceed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>I. On Promiscuity</p></b>

<p>[3] Michael Buchler&#8217;s recent <i>Music Theory Online</i> article, &#8220;Reconsidering Klumpenhouwer Networks,&#8221; challenges the analytical technique developed by Henry Klumpenhower and David Lewin on two basic counts. Buchler asserts that K-nets have the potential to &#8220;open a Pandora&#8217;s Box of relational permissiveness;&#8221;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> this aspect of Buchler&#8217;s K-net critique is concerned with the ability of K-nets to act as a cipher, particularly for trichords. This first aspect is related to a second, which sees the K-net model&#8217;s design as an affordance for its relational permissivity. Both critiques, however, are to be understood as a corrective to the theory&#8217;s purported abstractness. Buchler is most concerned with &#8220;try[ing] to have our networks reflect the musical surface to the greatest degree possible.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4] Bucher claims that of the 78 possible pairs of trichords, 78.8% can form 
isographic K-nets with one another. Two lines of inquiry follow from Buchler&#8217;s assertion: 1) the truth content and nature of Buchler&#8217;s claim itself and 2) the implications for a &#8220;promiscuous&#8221; or flexible analytical relationship. In his response to Buchler, Shaugn O&#8217;Donnell notes that it is only the three-note <i>set classes</i> that relate to one another 78.8% of the time. Three-note <i>pitch-class sets</i>, by contrast, relate to one another only 10.5% of the time, even with the use of O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s <i>double emploi</i>.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Yet the facts surrounding the relational permissivity of trichordal K-nets seem less than important to the other participants in the debate, who fail to comment on this potential error on 
Buchler&#8217;s part and focus instead on the issue of analytical relationships in general. This may be because there is a fair amount of anxiety concerning the 
claims of the analytical method at hand, or any analytical method at all. If it 
is true that K-nets are able show relationships (almost) wherever we would like 
them to, then analysts must decide if this is to the method&#8217;s credit or 
detriment.</p>

<p>[5] Phil Stoecker and Gretchen Foley address idiosyncratic scenarios in order to provide a foil for Buchler&#8217;s broadly written critique. Stoecker, in a 
dialectical turn, explores the unique properties of moments in which it is not 
possible to show a trichordal K-net relationship. Foley importantly points out 
particular situations in Perlean theory where K-nets show relationships that 
other analytical tools miss.</p>

<p>[6] O&#8217;Donnell, having already demonstrated that K-nets do in fact show significant relationships, nonetheless &#8220;embraces&#8221; their relational promiscuity, asserting that &#8220;music analysis is like storytelling,&#8221; and that &#8220;the relational abundance generated by K-nets further emphasizes that musicality, whatever that means in a given context, is in the hands and ears of the analyst rather than the theoretical apparatus itself.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> It is important to note here that in embracing the (potential) relational abundance of trichordal K-nets, O&#8217;Donnell has shifted 
the burden of proof from what he calls the &#8220;theoretical apparatus&#8221; to 
&#8220;musicality, whatever that means in a given context.&#8221; O&#8217;Donnell therefore implicitly asserts that theory is distinct from musicality. </p>

<p>[7] Klumpenhouwer clarifies the nature of Buchler&#8217;s complaint, pointing out that it is the top-down hierarchy&#8212;generated by the search for multiple levels of K-net relationships&#8212;that most bothers Buchler. Klumpenhouwer then proceeds to relate K-net analysis to Schachter&#8217;s theory of Schenkerian levels, claiming that both systems operate dialectically:</p>

<blockquote>
The various levels of structure are to be conceived heuristically as a single 
system, so that levels emerge simultaneously, rather than one and then the 
other.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Importantly, Klumpenhouwer notes that Buchler&#8217;s aversion to the top-down 
&#8220;theory-driven&#8221; approach in favor of a hypothetical bottom-up approach seems to reference a misguided interaction with empiricism, which seems to have &#8220;strayed into the picture.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Indeed, elsewhere Klumpenhouwer has written rigorously against such analytical ideologies.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> However, his own defense of K-net analysis 
as a dialectical procedure seems to skirt the real issue, which recurs in every 
author&#8217;s critique or defense: the musical surface. The advocacy of a dialectical approach still leaves the &#8220;bottom&#8221; undertheorized, especially considering the attention it has received in the commentary. Even through O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s, Stoecker&#8217;s, and Foley&#8217;s defenses of K-net analysis there remains an urgent concern for &#8220;a <i>true</i> reflection of the musical surface.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>II. On Hierarchies and Graph Theories</p></b>

<p>[8] The nature of the K-net itself and its relationship to networks of K-nets, or recursive network structures, is another significant aspect of Buchler&#8217;s 
critique. Buchler attempts to show that the structure of the K-net is both 
arbitrary (it can be re-drawn in a number of ways) and unnecessarily 
complicated. In addition, Buchler criticizes recursive network structures for 
their abstract quality: rather than expressing relationships about pitch-class 
sets, they instead express relationships about relationships (K-nets). As a 
possible solution to the arbitrariness and complexity of K-nets, Buchler proposes 
doing the analytical work of K-nets with O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s dual transformations. However, Buchler does not propose an alternative way of conceptualizing the recursive network structures&#8212;in his criticism these are perhaps the most objectionable aspect of K-net analyses.</p>

<p>[9] In their responses to Buchler, Klumpenhouwer and Nolan both demonstrate the ontological difference between the K-net and the dual transformation. Dual 
transformations are not substitutable for K-nets, nor are they a simplification, 
since they show fundamentally different relational structures. However, the 
insightful responses of Klumpenhouwer and Nolan fail to address Buchler on his 
own terms. If Buchler claims ontological equivalence between the dual 
transformation and the K-net, it is only implicitly and in the service of <i>using</i> the dual transformation to do the work heretofore done by the K-net. In this regard, O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s response to Buchler is the most appropriate. O&#8217;Donnell shows that the internal I<sub><i>n</i></sub> arrows of the K-net are not necessary to recognize isography or calculate hyper transformations, but &#8220;are still necessary for the unity of the musical sonorities participating in these transformations.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Following O&#8217;Donnell, then, dual transformations cannot do the work of K-nets, as Buchler would suggest. However, a separate question arises concerning the very unity of the musical sonorities participating in the transformations. O&#8217;Donnell assumes that we do, in fact, hear the unity of such sonorities, but quickly amends:</p>

<blockquote>
Even when we hear the independent paths of two subsets in a dual transformation, 
we very often hear the supersets as single, unified musical &#8220;objects,&#8221; particularly in homorhythmic contexts. A good example would be Catherine Nolan&#8217;s analysis of Webern&#8217;s <i>Das Augenlicht</i> that Buchler champions as a successful use of K-nets.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Two aspects of O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s astute answer to Buchler (on the latter&#8217;s own terms) slightly weaken its impact. Firstly, although O&#8217;Donnell asserts that we indeed do hear the supersets modeled by K-nets as unified objects, he scare-quotes the term &#8220;objects.&#8221; Secondly, he scales the extent of his claim back to &#8220;particularly in homorhythmic contexts.&#8221;</p>

<p>[10] It is significant that Catherine Nolan&#8217;s analysis of the chorale passage from Webern&#8217;s <i>Das Augenlicht </i>has received so much positive attention in the K-net debate.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> This analysis has served as a paragon for a successful modeling of the musical surface using K-nets. Praised almost unanimously for its reflection of register and rhythm, Nolan&#8217;s analysis appears to be very much the exception rather than the rule. But why is it that Nolan&#8217;s application of K-nets seems more &#8220;musical&#8221; than others? I argue that it is only by making recourse to the organization of other parameters (apart from pitch-class) that Nolan&#8217;s analysis is able to quell musical-surface anxieties. Since the progression of the non-hierarchical K-nets in her analysis follows a normative parametric organization that we have already been trained to hear (after all, it is an analysis of a <i>chorale</i> passage), it does not incur the abstraction citation.</p>

<p>[11] The anxiety surrounding abstraction on all sides of the debate is at its 
paramount in Buchler&#8217;s dismissal of recursive network structures. Catherine 
Losada&#8217;s commentary adds support to Buchler&#8217;s argument, asserting that relationships between inversional subscripts in network recursion are 
&#8220;completely spurious.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> Scott Murphy&#8217;s response complicates the critiques, however, showing that Buchler&#8217;s various complaints regarding recursion are not universally applicable to all types of network recursion.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> But Buchler&#8217;s criticism of levels is only one portion of his critique of recursive network structures, the core of which was originally articulated by Joe Straus:</p>

<blockquote>
[Recursive network structures are] a problem when our desire for [them] leads us 
to emphasize musical features that might otherwise be of relatively little 
interest.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Once again, the core of analytical anxiety rests with the problem of modeling 
musicality (perhaps even locating the &#8220;context&#8221; in O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s phrase &#8220;whatever that means in a given context&#8221;), and always returns to the musical surface.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>III. The Musical Surface?</p></b>

<p>[12] We might generally understand that references to the musical surface for those involved in the K-net debate point to some natural, pre-theoretical approach to the score that is sensitive to the concerns of the musician. The process in which theory is undercut by reference to musicality is part of a general anxiety surrounding the theoretical apparatus. Both critics and defenders of the K-net theory are quick to assure their readers that their real concerns lie with music and musicianship. The problem with this position is that it assumes a vantage point somehow outside of any theoretical lens; it assumes that notions of musicality are themselves untouched by theoretical discourse, pedagogy, or enculturation. This position seems to eschew theory for something more &#8220;real&#8221; which is found only a step away in musicality.</p>

<p>[13] In his book on the future of Theory, Jean-Michel Rabat&eacute; explains the relationship between Theory and Lacan&#8217;s notion of the hysteric. Both Theory and hysteria are &#8220;never satisfied with a neat answer, [they] always ask for more in the name of a certain notion of truth.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Rabat&eacute; brings Theory together with hysteria in order to show that detractors of Theory deploy a hysterical mode of discourse that is similar to the very practice of Theory itself. In this way, the critique of Theory returns itself back to Theory:</p>

<blockquote>
The discourse of the Hysteric will want to put the subject in the first place, 
but in order to insist upon subjective division in the quest for the master-signifier. Often one single signifier <nobr>. . .</nobr> will orient the quest and be taken for the whole truth, perhaps in the hope of proving that all theoreticians are essentially wrong or lacking <nobr>somewhere . . .</nobr>
</br></br>
If Theory reproduces this pattern, it is because it has anticipated it, by what 
could be described either as a hermeneutical circle or a hysterical ellipsis. 
Theory will indeed aim at questioning all types of knowledge and discourses <nobr>. . .</nobr> In doing so, it will generate some kind of knowledge and will aim, no doubt, at a truth.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>[14] As Rabat&eacute; points out, a &#8220;single signifier&#8221; often guides the mission to prove Theory inadequate. In the case of the K-net debate, musicality and the musical surface seem to have assumed this role. Nonetheless, these notions return themselves to theory in Rabat&eacute;&#8217;s &#8220;hermeneutical circle or hysterical ellipsis,&#8221; as they themselves are also constructed through a theoretical lens of some kind.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>

<p>[15]Hysterical or not, I assert that the cry for musicality on both sides of the K-net debate is truly a cry for <i>more</i> theory rather than less. If K-nets cast too broadly, drawing relationships where they will, then perhaps what they want is the company of other theories. If rhythm and register frame a passage readily for K-net analysis&#8212;as is the case in Catherine Nolan&#8217;s analysis of <i>Das Augenlicht</i>&#8212;then perhaps what we need are theories of rhythm and register to accompany K-nets in the analytical endeavor. Attempting to clarify what is meant by the various references to the musical surface or musicality in the K-net debate, I wish to explore the potential for K-nets to work in tandem with other theories.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>IV. More Theory</p></b>

<p>[16] The recent outpouring of meta-literature on K-nets points up several of their interesting relational properties. However, as we might imagine, there are additional properties of K-nets yet unexplored. In this meditation, I will examine a particular property of the negative isography relationship, showing its invariant connection to a particular dodecaphonic configuration. Rather than employing this observation in a critique of K-nets as a cipher for the &#8220;musical surface,&#8221; we might imagine situations where this property of K-nets becomes more interesting in the company of additional theory.</p>

<p>[17]
<b>Figure 1</b> shows the negative isography relationship between two box-style 
four-node K-nets. The negative isography relationship allows us to see inverse 
relationships between the T-transforms in these K-nets. Because its analytical 
insight centers on inverse relationships, negative isography is a relative of 
the inversional pairings between Prime (P) and Inversional (I) row-form pairs in 
dodecaphonic organization. This also holds for the inversional pairings between 
Retrograde (R) and Retrograde-Inversional (RI) row-form pairs. Both sets of 
relationships&#8212;negative isography and P&amp;I/R&amp;RI row-form pairs&#8212;show inverse 
relationships between transforms of successive PCs: in the box-style four-node 
K-nets of Figure 1, this inverse relationship occurs between the pairs of 
transformations on either side of the two K-net boxes. In row-form pairs, the 
inverse relationship occurs between any set of successive PCs in prime or 
retrograde row forms, as related to their corresponding set of successive PCs in 
inversion or retrograde-inversion row-forms respectively. <b>Figure 2</b> shows this 
relationship between row-form pairs.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>



<p>[18]
<b>Figure 3</b> below shows how their shared tie to the inverse relationship affords an 
invariant interaction between K-nets and a particular row-form configuration. It 
follows from the observations above that a negatively isographic K-net will 
model any relationship between successive PCs from a P/R row-form pair to an 
I/RI row-form pair, as pictured in Figure 3. The inversional relationships 
between the P and I, R and RI row forms themselves is responsible for the 
invariant ability to draw this relationship. </p>

It would seem, then, that we might add this particular interaction between 
negatively isographic K-nets and row forms to the litany of K-net relational 
permissivities. After all, any row-form pairing like that shown in Figure 3 will 
render negatively isographic K-net relationships wherever one might wish to show 
them, fully allowing for an analysis that would &#8220;emphasize musical features that 
might otherwise be of relatively little interest.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> I will argue again, however, 
that such relationally permissive associations become interesting in the company 
of more theory. In order to illustrate this point, I will turn to an example 
from Webern&#8217;s <i>Das Augenlicht.</i> Apart from its fame in the K-net debate, 
<i>Das Augenlicht </i>is particularly pertinent in the present context because of Webern&#8217;s 
negotiation of row forms through the piece.</p>

<p>[20]
The voice parts in Webern&#8217;s <i>Das Augenlicht</i> enter in a pair of duets, beginning 
with the soprano and tenor voices in measure 8, as shown in <b>Example 1</b>. While the 
soprano line in measures 6&#8211;11 comprises the P<sub>8</sub> row-form, its partner the tenor 
line comprises the R<sub>8</sub> row form in those same measures. The lower voices answer 
with their own duet in the measures that follow; the alto line completes the I<sub>8</sub> 
row-form in measures 14&#8211;19, while the bass line completes the RI<sub>8</sub> row-form in 
measures 14&#8211;18. Hence, a P/R row-form pair in measures 6&#8211;11 is answered by an 
I/RI row-form pair in measures 14&#8211;19.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"></font></p>
<p>[21]
A number of interesting relationships hold between these paired duets. The 
melodic unfolding is somewhat similar in all voices, as are the harmonic 
relationships between the two duets. In order to examine the correspondences 
closely, a theory of melody will relate the diachronic unfolding of each row 
form, while K-nets show relationships between melodic segments.</p>

<p>[22]
<b>Example 2</b> shows melodic relationships between the paired duets. I chose Eugene 
Narmour&#8217;s Implication-Realization model for melody to relate the different 
melodic characters of the four row-forms in this excerpt. Narmour&#8217;s I-R theory 
not only gives us a lexicon to relate melodic qualities (outside of a tonal 
context), but also offers a theory of segmentation rooted in the basic gestalt 
notions of similarity and difference. Like Christopher Hasty&#8217;s approach in his 
1981 &#8220;Segmentation and Process in Post-Tonal Music,&#8221; (also quite celebrated in 
post-tonal analytical literature), Narmour&#8217;s I-R theory is sensitive to degree 
of change and degree of consistency. Narmour&#8217;s theory also allows for 
modification based on style (intra-opus as well as extra-opus), and can be 
applied and related to other parameters such as duration or even harmony.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup>
<p>[23] The I-R model is grounded on two basic theoretical propositions: (1) similarity 
engenders the expectation of more similarity, or A + A implies A; and (2) 
differentiation engenders the expectation of more differentiation, or A + B 
implies C. These theoretical propositions correspond to the two primary 
archetypes that govern Narmour&#8217;s model: Process (P) and Reversal (R). Where 
registral direction is constant over the course of two successive intervals 
(three pitches), the analytical symbol applied is P, where registral direction 
changes, R. Additional symbols +, &#8211;, 
&#0126;, and &#0186; reflect degree of intervallic 
change, ranging from exact intervallic repetition (&#0186;), basic similarity (&#0126;), a 
great decrease in intervallic size (&#8211;), to a great increase in intervallic size 
(+). Sufficient parametric difference (in duration, accentuation, register, or 
harmony in a tonal context) renders a break in grouping structure. If a group 
consists of two pitches, the symbol applied simply shows the interval size 
between them. </p>
<p>[24] As Example 2 illustrates, several melodic grouping structures are common to 
voices in the same duet, while some melodic structures echo across between the 
two duets. The I-R grouping structures point out the rhythmic canon in each 
duet, and the labels for these grouping structures also allow us to see which 
melodic segments in the duets are the most closely related. Both duets open with 
a dyad in each voice: the soprano line in measure 6 and bass line in measure 14 
rise while the alto line in measure 6 and tenor line in measure 14 fall. While 
Narmour&#8217;s theory accounts for the functional similarity of these openings in 
terms of the grouping structure for their respective melodies, a K-net describes 
how they relate to one another harmonically. The box-style 4-node K-net pictured 
in <b>Example 3</b> is in keeping with both register and Narmour&#8217;s grouping structure 
for the melodic unfolding of these sonorities. The harmonic relationship between 
the opening of the first and second duets can be described through the use of 
the negative isography label &lt;I<sub>8</sub>&gt;, as shown in <b>Example 4</b>.</p>

<p>[25]
While the melodies in the first duet continue directly to retrospective 
reversals after the opening dyad, the melodies of the second duet have a more 
fragmented opening. The next correspondence in grouping structure between the 
two duets is the sonority formed by the fourth and fifth pitches of each line. 
Again, a box-style 4-note K-net models the harmonic relationship between the two 
melodic dyads, which consistently is described by the negative isography label 
&lt;I<sub>8</sub>&gt;. </p>
<p>[26]
A melodic grouping structure consisting of the sixth through eighth pitches in 
each line proves the most melodically consistent between the two duets. The 
soprano and alto voices both contain two large intervallic leaps in one 
registral direction: melodic retrospective P&#8211; structures. The tenor and bass, in 
their respective duets, also exhibit large intervallic leaps, but in alternating 
registral directions: melodic R&#8211; structures. The &lt;I<sub>8</sub>&gt;, box-style 6-note K-net 
models the harmonic relationship between these corresponding melodic segments.</p>
<p>[27]
As explicated above, any string of corresponding successive pitches will form 
the negative isography &lt;I<sub>8</sub>&gt; between the two duets. For this reason, the melodic 
grouping structures towards the end of the duets are less interesting. Neither 
grouping nor melodic symbology correspond, and so the K-net relationships that 
are possible to draw here would model melodic correlates that are 
non-correspondent in Narmour&#8217;s model. </p>
<p>[28]
Rather than make recourse to a hazily defined &#8220;musical surface,&#8221; or argue that 
these correspondences are &#8220;otherwise of relatively little interest,&#8221; K-nets can 
keep company with more theory in order to show multifaceted relationships. Not 
only does the K-net theory benefit from the melodic integration with Narmour&#8217;s 
I-R, but I-R can also gain post-tonal harmonic insight in this cooperative 
effort. In tandem, both theories make reference outside their own systems, but 
they do so with reference to very specific parameters. As individuals with 
predilections for precision, I imagine that this aspect of theory-coupling may 
appeal to those interested in refining K-net theory. </p>

&#8220;tacit&#8221; forms of knowledge, which, one might argue, aptly characterize 
musicality. If it is true that for many of us musicality is knowledge of the 
&#8220;tacit&#8221; sort, it is also true that we acquire this knowledge in a particular 
tradition of pedagogy, one that is not entirely non-discursive or, as Polanyi 
has it, &#8220;ineffable.&#8221; In any case, this tension (or aura?) surrounding the 
pedagogical tradition of musicality is quite interesting in its own right and 
certainly merits the space of a separate theoretical study. See Michael Polanyi, 
<i>Personal Knowledge</i> (London: Routledge, 1958), particularly pp. 87&#8211;97.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> For notational convenience, this figure and those following represent the

readers pause. The claims of Narmour&#8217;s system are explicitly cognitive, while 
the relationship of K-net theory to hearing is, as the recent debate 
demonstrates, at least suspect. Narmour&#8217;s claims notwithstanding, his I-R theory 
carries its own merit as an analytical tool. It is useful to me here in carving 
basic melodic structures and relationships through the use of his parametric 
scales, which&#8212;even if one might challenge their claims to cognitive innateness&#8212;serve to differentiate types of musical relationships from one another in a 
systematic way. See Eugene Narmour, <i>The Analysis and Cognition of Basic Melodic 
Structures</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), and idem., <i>The Analysis
