<p>[1] In his recent review of my article, &ldquo;Atonality, Analysis, and
the Intentional Fallacy,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Edward Latham seriously
misrepresents or distorts my positions, and misreads (or simply
misunderstands) my arguments.  Since a detailed response to all
of his criticisms would take an inordinate amount of space, I
must limit my remarks to the most serious.
<p>

[2] Although he concedes that my &ldquo;critique of Forte&rsquo;s
segmentational decisions is perceptive and valid&rdquo; (par. 7) Latham
proceeds to suggest that my argument is fatally flawed because I
did not take Forte&rsquo;s recent work into consideration.  Latham goes
on to state that Forte&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Pitch-Class Set Analysis Today&rdquo;
(which was discussed at length in my critique) &ldquo;is actually
Forte&rsquo;s own attempt to signal the <i>end</i> of an initial phase in
the evolution of pitch-class set theory and the beginning of a
new phase in which a more sophisticated analytical method might
be developed&rdquo; (par. 11).  Latham asserts that Forte has
&ldquo;presented a general outline of such a method in &lsquo;New Approaches
to Linear Analysis&rsquo;&rdquo; (par. 11) and has expanded upon this idea in
subsequent writings.  This leads Latham to chide me for not
discussing a recent article by Forte on Schoenberg&rsquo;s Op. 15: &ldquo;it
seems rather surprising (and unfortunate) that he chooses to
ignore this particular article&rdquo; (par. 13).  
<p>

[3] The clear implication of this line of argument is that my
critique of Forte&rsquo;s methods of pitch-class set analysis is
invalid (or at least moot) because Forte&rsquo;s own work has long ago
satisfactorily addressed the problems I discussed.  In Latham&rsquo;s
view, pitch-class set analysis of Schoenberg&rsquo;s music remains a
viable approach because Forte has developed a more sophisticated
method for its application&mdash;linear analysis&mdash;a method that
(presumably) is free from the problems raised in my article.  If
so, then the real problem seems to be my ignorance of (or willful
disinterest in) the recent theoretical literature, not any
problems with Forte&rsquo;s (recent) writings.  
<p>

[4] I beg to differ.  In no way do the articles Latham cites
satisfactorily address any of the problems that were raised in my
article.
<p>

[5] Latham is correct that Forte has developed a new approach
(linear analysis) for the application of pitch-class set
analysis.  In recent years, Forte has applied this new idea to a
wide variety of compositions from the end of the nineteenth and
beginning of the twentieth centuries.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>  However, there is
nothing in any of these more recent articles to indicate that
pitch-class set analysis, as preached and practiced in his
earlier essays, has been replaced by this new method.  Rather, it
seems abundantly clear that this newer method is being offered as
a supplement to, not a complete replacement for, the earlier
idea.  This is particularly evident in that these later articles
cite the earlier work as authority, not as items that need
correction.  Normally, when a scholar wishes to correct or
improve upon his or her earlier scholarship, he or she does so by
explicitly acknowledging the deficiencies or problems in his or
her earlier writings.  If Forte had wished to make it clear to
the scholarly world that the segmentations in his earlier
applications of pitch-class set analysis were arbitrary and
inconsistent then he needed to have stated so explicitly.  If
linear analysis was meant to correct the flaws in earlier methods
of pitch-class set analysis, Forte should have admitted, for
example, that Perle and Taruskin were right in their critiques,
and that what Latham calls the &ldquo;undaunted&rdquo; application of pitch-class set analysis to Schoenberg&rsquo;s music (among others) has, in
fact, led to serious problems.  Forte then could have gone on to
state that he had developed a new method of pitch-class analysis
that successfully addresses those problems&mdash;linear analysis.  To
my knowledge, Forte has never done this.  In the absence of such
an acknowledgment, it must be assumed that he stands by his
earlier work.
<p>

[6] But it is not just the absence of such a clear acknowledgment
that shows that Forte stands by his earlier work.  There are
explicit citations that confirm this to be the case.  For
example, Latham criticizes me for failing to consider Forte&rsquo;s
article &ldquo;Pitch-Class Set Genera and the Origin of Modern Harmonic
Species&rdquo; (1988).  Latham states that this was &ldquo;intended to
supercede [sic] the K and Kh relations as a means of describing
the relationships among the different sets employed (or
discovered, pace Haimo) in a composition, the system of genera is
clearly a further refinement of pitch-class set theory, and as
such it, too, needs to be included in any evaluation of the
theory and its analytical application&rdquo; (par. 14).  If the reader
had read only Latham&rsquo;s review and did not look up the article
cited, the reader would undoubtedly conclude that there were some
important and substantive refinements of pitch-class set theory
in that article that addressed the problems I identified and
thereby invalidated my critique.  The reader might also assume
that Forte&rsquo;s post-genera thinking might very well have led Forte&mdash;
as Latham suggests&mdash;to revise his analysis of Op. 11, No. 1 and
include the &ldquo;tonal&rdquo; sets he had studiously omitted in the
analysis I had critiqued.
<p>

[7] That is simply not the case.  And the reader can garner just
how misplaced Latham&rsquo;s criticism is by opening the article in
question to the page where Forte discusses Schoenberg&rsquo;s Op. 11,
No. 1 (page 238).  If there are important refinements here that I
needed to have taken into consideration, then why does Forte
simply assert about Op. 11, No. 1 that its &ldquo;pitch-class set
vocabulary <nobr>. . .</nobr> consists of exactly six hexachords, six
pentachords, two tetrachords, and two trichords&rdquo;?<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  And what
does Forte give as the source for this assertion?  None other
than the very article that was the centerpiece of my critique,
&ldquo;The Magical Kaleidoscope&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>  From this one instance (and this
is merely a representative example) it is clear that Forte stands
by his previous work and is building new ideas on that
foundation.
<p>

[8] That was, of course, the reason why I chose to concentrate my
critique on the foundation.  Since Forte&rsquo;s subsequent work (as
well as that of numerous other scholars) is dependent on that
foundation, a critique of pitch-class set analysis needs to
concentrate on determining how solid that foundation is.  That,
in turn, dictated why I concentrated so much attention on
relatively old articles like &ldquo;Sets and Nonsets&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  When I
examined Forte&rsquo;s analysis of Op. 11, No. 1, it was just not clear
to me what his rationale was for choosing some pitch-class sets
and excluding others.  There seemed to be no rational reason for
his choices.  This prompted me to track down this idea and
determine what were the bases for his selection.  As it happens,
the only place that this was clearly stated was in &ldquo;Sets and
Nonsets&rdquo;.
<p>

[9] But what of Latham&rsquo;s implication that Forte&rsquo;s most recent
writings deal successfully with the problems raised in my
article?  Latham finds it &ldquo;surprising (and unfortunate)&rdquo; that I
chose &ldquo;to ignore&rdquo; (par. 13) Forte&rsquo;s recent analysis of
Schoenberg&rsquo;s Op. 15.  Again, the implication seems to be that
whatever problems might have existed before, they have been fixed
in the recent writing.  If this is so, Latham would be absolutely
right to criticize my article.
<p>

[10] Sadly, this is not the case.  It would be well beyond the
scope of a response to a review to go into the kind of detail
necessary to make a thorough argument in support of this
assertion, so I trust the reader will understand if I merely limn
the outlines of what my argument would be.
<p>

[11] My critique of Forte&rsquo;s analysis of Op. 11, No. 1 rested on
the easily verifiable assertion that Forte&rsquo;s method fails his own
criterion of testability (i.e., using pitch-class set analysis,
different analysts will not produce analyses that intersect in
significant ways).  Instead, an objective pitch-class set
analysis (which is a type two analysis) of Schoenberg&rsquo;s music
simply yields an unwieldy, random, almost unlimited, mass of
sets.  The only way that Forte can produce a specific, limited,
list of sets upon which he claims the work to be based, is by a
biographical hypothesis (a type one assertion)&mdash;i.e., that
Schoenberg consciously and intentionally chose a specific number
of hexachords (six) and pentachords (also six) for numerological
reasons and that some of the specific sets chosen had clear
autobiographical or stylistic motivations (e.g., EsCHBEG and
others).  The documentary record proves this biographical
hypothesis to be false (because of what is actually in the
documentary record, not because any and all documents are&mdash;as
Latham falsely imputes to my &ldquo;seeming naivete&rdquo;&mdash;automatic &ldquo;get
out of jail free cards&rdquo;).  Therefore, the analysis fails as
either a type one or a type two statement.
<p>

[12] Precisely the same problems surface in Forte&rsquo;s analysis of
Op. 15.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>  Forte&rsquo;s choice of tetrachords in general, and
specific tetrachords in particular, as the basic motives of Op.
15, plainly fails the criterion of testability and thus cannot
work as a pure type two analysis.  (That is, independent
analysts, given the same material and using the same method,
would not come up tetrachords, only tetrachords, and only these
tetrachords.)  It is hardly coincidental then, that Forte makes
recourse to various type one assertions to shore up his argument,
precisely as in the analysis discussed in my article.  Thus,
Forte sees Schoenberg as slipping musical equivalents of his own,
of Mathilde Schoenberg&rsquo;s, and of Richard Gerstl&rsquo;s names into the
music.  In other words, he has tried to justify what should have
been a pure type two analysis with type one rationalizations. 
That would be bad enough, but the biographical claims he advances
are not viable:  occasional letters completely buried in a
complicated fabric are not ciphers placed there by the composer,
they are fictions imposed by the analyst on the music.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><p>

[13] Therefore, for precisely the reasons outlined in my article,
this recent analysis fails both as either a type one or a type
two assertion.  It does not (cannot) work on its own;  similarly,
the biographical hypotheses advanced are patently false. 
Contrary to Latham&rsquo;s insinuations, nothing in Forte&rsquo;s subsequent
writings has satisfactorily addressed the problems I raised in my
discussion of his analysis of Op. 11, No. 1.
<p>

[14] Unfortunately, this type of criticism&mdash;criticism by
insinuation&mdash;is endemic in the review.  Throughout his review,
Latham stoops to sarcasm and scorn, but, tellingly (as detailed
in the case discussed in paragraphs 9&ndash;13, above), he fails to
back up his criticisms with relevant facts.  Thus he states that
I present &ldquo;a tidy, if not entirely objective, encapsulation&rdquo;,
without identifying what lacked objectivity in my encapsulation. 
He sarcastically dismisses the facsimiles I included in my
article by stating that I produce &ldquo;several handsome plates of
very official-looking sketch materials,&rdquo; (par. 2) but does not
address the extraordinarily revealing contents of those sketches
(my Plate 3 proves that Schoenberg was blissfully unaware of
anything resembling pitch-class sets until as late as 1926). 
Moreover, he hints that there is something terribly wrong in my
using the analysis of Op. 11 No. 1 from &ldquo;The Magical
Kaleidoscope&rdquo; and not the later version from &ldquo;Pitch Class Set
Analysis Today&rdquo; (par. 7).  Indeed, I am alleged to have admitted
that the later version contains much more information.  Of
course, he does not offer a single, substantive reason why this&mdash;
even if true&mdash;would make any difference in the argument I
presented.  And he couldn&rsquo;t, since the version I used <i>was</i> the
more detailed version.  (Need I add that Forte himself cites the
&ldquo;The Magical Kaleidoscope&rdquo; version and not the &ldquo;Pitch Class Set
Analysis Today&rdquo; version in &ldquo;Pitch-Class Set Genera&rdquo;?)  
<p>

[15] If Latham disagrees with my argument, he should stick to the
issues and should not demean himself and the cause he supports by
resorting to groundless insinuations, misplaced sarcasm, unseemly
ridicule, and unsubstantiated accusations.  That he felt obliged
to do so suggests that he has a very weak case and knows it.</p>
