<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Will there ever come a time when the Beatles <i>stop</i> 
exerting a hold on our collective musical consciousness? I doubt it, judging by 
the sheer quantity of records they continue to sell, the research they continue 
to spawn, and, as this volume of conference proceedings attests to, the 
continuing joy and fascination that their music generates. It should come as no 
surprise that the music of the Beatles appears fully legitimized within the 
canon of Western art music: their recording outtakes compare favorably as 
musical artifacts with Beethoven&rsquo;s sketchbooks; Cambridge University Press 
includes a monograph devoted to <i>Sgt. Pepper&rsquo;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> 
alongside Bizet&rsquo;s <i>Carmen,</i> Berg&rsquo;s <i>Lulu,</i> and so on; and theorists 
think nothing of using Schenkerian analysis and other comparable techniques to 
elucidate structural and expressive elements of their music. For those of us who 
came of age in the Sixties, undoubtedly we can point to such milestones as the 
release of <i>I Want To Hold Your Hand,</i> the Beatles&rsquo; first appearance on the 
Ed Sullivan Show, and our first hearing of <i>Sgt. Pepper,</i> as formative 
events for an entire generation, as much as landing on the moon and the war in 
Vietnam.<p>[2] This volume of proceedings from the Beatles 2000 Conference at 
the University of Jyv&auml;skyl&auml; in Finland consists of 25 essays, minimally edited, 
presented by an international array of musicians and scholars. They are divided 
into six groups: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Keynote addresses</li>
	<li>Culture, history, cultural history</li>
	<li>Music theory, psychology, education</li>
	<li>Roots and heritage</li>
	<li>Musical style and its change</li>
	<li>Making music</li>
</ul>
<p>The last and longest of the three keynote addresses, Walter Everett&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 
Future of Beatles Research,&rdquo; provides a useful point of departure for examining 
the objectives and agendas of the volume as a whole. </p>
<p>[3] Everett begins by proposing a number of topics warranting future 
investigation. It is worth quoting the essay&rsquo;s opening as his fundamental (and 
implicit) assumptions are revealing:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>All who study the music itself have benefited from great strides in the 
	explication of its place in twentieth-century culture.<nobr> . . . </nobr>My purpose in 
	this essay is to propose six interrelated topics of future investigation, 
	all suggested by the usual methods and aims of the musicologist but rarely 
	applied in the rock medium, that would likely yield important and 
	interesting results. The six topics include (1) a thorough history of the 
	Beatles&rsquo; performance practices, (2) a more complete study of the Beatles&rsquo; 
	compositional style, (3) a closer study of the stylistic forebears of the 
	Beatles, (4) the need for a definitive <i>Urtext</i> of the Beatles canon, 
	(5) a start at Beatles sketch study, and (6) the need for widely available 
	comprehensive indexing, reposition, and/or distribution of both source 
	materials and scholarly work. (25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two key phrases here with respect to studies in popular music are &ldquo;the music 
itself&rdquo; and &ldquo;the usual methods and aims of the musicologist.&rdquo; Many musicologists 
of course take issue with the notion of the music itself and further would argue 
that popular music, even more than traditional Western art music, necessitates a 
broader-based approach. Their &ldquo;usual aims and methods&rdquo; raises the question of 
&ldquo;whose musicology?&rdquo; I am certainly not questioning the validity of applying 
rigorous structural methodologies for popular music; one need only look to 
Everett&rsquo;s two definitive books on the Beatles and many other articles and talks 
for exemplars in sensitive analysis and interpretation. Rather, it is to make 
explicit the disciplinary boundaries Everett assumes in mapping the terrain of 
future research. This becomes significant in light of how the remaining 
twenty-two essays (not including the other keynotes) instantiate his categories. 
Respectively, there are four essays relating to performance practice (category 
1), five on compositional style (2), two on stylistic forebears (3), one each on
<i>Urtext</i> (here I stretched a little to accommodate Jouni Koskim&auml;ki&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Variation as the Key Principle in the Vocal Parts of &lsquo;Cry Baby Cry&rsquo;&rdquo; as he 
addresses problems of transcription), sketch study and distribution (4, 5 and 
6). Significantly, six essays do not fall readily into one of Everett&rsquo;s six 
topics, and two more are broadly interdisciplinary, combining harmonic style 
analysis with social and cognitive models. </p>
<p>[4] As it happens, some of these non-conformist essays are among the most 
interesting and provocative in the book. Janne M&auml;kel&auml;&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Greatest Story of 
Pop Music? Challenges of Writing The Beatles History&rdquo; provides a 
historiographical perspective, viewing &ldquo;Beatles histories,&rdquo; as he calls them, in 
four successive phases: contemporary histories, written during the time they 
were still extant as a performing/recording group; transitional histories (to 
Lennon&rsquo;s death in 1980); remembrance histories; and an ongoing &ldquo;cultural 
re-evaluation&rdquo;. His conclusion eloquently sums up our continuing involvement 
with their music: &ldquo;The Beatles&mdash;whether understood as an actual pop group 
operating in the 1960s or a part of the continuing history&mdash;was and still is 
constantly constructed and reconstructed, both by the members of the group and 
people commenting on them, as a cultural phenomenon. The Beatles is a cultural 
icon of which image is everywhere and of which meaning is multidimensional, 
unfathomable, and continuing.&rdquo; (53)</p>
<p>[5] Two essays that got me thinking about the deep and mysterious connections 
between music, words and our status as social beings were Ger Tillekens&rsquo;s &ldquo;Words 
and Chords: The Semantic Shifts of the Beatles&rsquo; Chords&rdquo; and his student Juul 
Mulder&rsquo;s complementary &ldquo;Semantic Shifts in Beatles&rsquo; Chord Progressions: On the 
Perception of Shifts in Song Contexts Induced by Chords.&rdquo; Tillekens attempts to 
relate the Beatles&rsquo;s penchant for choosing unusual chord progressions to a model 
of peer group conversation and interaction, first proposed by Rom Harr&eacute; in 1983. 
As is often the case with ambitious interdisciplinary efforts, the essay falls 
prey to over-reductionism and over-generalization; e.g., &ldquo;The idiom of popular 
music mainly is conversational and therefore the harmonic context of popular 
songs can be equated to the context of conversation between peers.&rdquo; (104) That 
said, it is at least plausible that the singular use of a mode-mixture chord, 
the unexpected mode shift of a previously-stated chord, or the patterned use of 
major chords and their relatives in sequence (&ldquo;I Want To Hold Your Hand&rdquo;: I &ndash; V 
&ndash; vi &ndash; iii), may be related along the dimensions of conversation/speech action 
that the author proposes in analyzing the semantic underpinnings of the lyrics 
(public vs. private spaces, open declaration vs. interior monologue, etc.). 
Mulder&rsquo;s work, based on her teacher&rsquo;s, investigates whether listeners actually 
<i>perceive</i> semantic shifts along the lines predicted by the theory. After a whole 
lot of data analysis, the upshot is that the theory is <i>at best </i>about 33% 
accurate with respect to any of the proposed semantic categories of chord 
changes. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that these studies are onto something 
real, deep and subtle&mdash;as assuredly as mode mixture and chromatic mediants 
represent signifiers and markers in Romantic <i>Lieder. </i>The question is describing 
precisely how they work. </p>
<p>[6] Other cultural and comparative studies range widely in quality. Bruce 
Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Beatles in Australia&rdquo; at first appears to be of merely local 
interest, but then gathers force in its tracking of profound changes in the 
cultural and social landscape in Australia in the lead-up to and during the 
Aussie tour by the Beatles in 1964. By comparison, Hannu Tolvanen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do You Want 
To Know A Secret: The Music of the Beatles and the Finnish Cover Versions in the 
1960&rsquo;s&rdquo; and Derek Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;(What&rsquo;s the Copy?) The Beatles and Oasis&rdquo; suffer 
respectively from purely local focus and a surfeit of examples with too little 
analysis of their meaning. A similar problem attends Pandel Collaros&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 
Music of the Beatles in Undergraduate Music Theory Instruction.&rdquo; The essay 
provides a long list of common harmony topics with representative songs 
exemplifying them; the problem is that the unmediated large-scale incorporation 
of the Beatles&rsquo; music as basic harmony fodder runs the danger of trivializing 
the music. Nonetheless, Collaros does highlight its potential usefulness in the 
classroom.</p>
<p>[7] For music theorists and teachers of theory and analysis, the most 
informative essays are those concerning performance practice and style. Of these 
Naphtali Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tonal Oscillation in the Beatles&rsquo; Songs&rdquo; stands out for its 
clarity and sensitivity. He begins by describing its temporal and aesthetic 
effect: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Oscillation between two well-defined tonal centers is a simple solution to a 
fundamental compositional problem: how to &lsquo;stop time&rsquo; without paralyzing 
movement. Back-and-forth motion between two alternative tonics neutralizes the 
forward march of notes and thereby stops the hands of the musical clock; the 
music moves and stands in place simultaneously. The hypnotic movement of the 
tonal pendulum may give listeners a sense of meditative rest or put them in an 
ecstatic mood, depending on the conditions of the oscillation (tempo, rhythm, 
and intensity). (88)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His analytical approach adapts Schenkerian theory to the analysis of &ldquo;bifocal 
tonality.&rdquo; For each song he provides succinct motivation in the lyrics for using 
tonal oscillation, not surprisingly involving a duality of some kind (boy-girl, 
man-another man, illusion-reality, etc). While most of the songs he cites 
involve oscillation between relative or parallel keys, some oscillate between 
keys a <i>major 2nd</i> apart (e.g., &ldquo;Good Day Sunshine&rdquo; and &ldquo;For the Benefit of Mr. 
Kite&rdquo;). </p>
<p>[8] Alert readers will have noticed that, thus far, I have cited essays solely 
by male commentators; only four of the twenty-five essays are authored by women. 
Is this merely chance? Does this represent the normal state of affairs in our 
field? Is there a pervasive sexist streak in popular music scholarship typified 
by this volume? Two essays take on gender-related issues directly. The first, 
the keynote by Sheila Whitely, &ldquo;No Fixed Agenda: The Position of the Beatles 
Within Popular/Rock Music,&rdquo; focuses on <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> as a defining moment in the 
Western pop-music canon, in particular on &ldquo;Lucy in the Sky&rdquo; and how the LSD 
experience becomes encoded into its music. Further, Whitely points to the song 
as representative of an illusory, idealized femininity within which &ldquo;beauty or 
sexuality is desirable to the extent that it is idealised and unattainable.&rdquo; (page 
9) She shows strong evidence for the (conscious or unconscious) degrading of 
women through such idealization&mdash;in marked contrast to what she terms overtly 
sexist bands like the Rolling Stones (e.g., &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want you part of my world / 
Just you be my back-street girrl&rdquo;)&mdash;with deep roots in the male chauvinism of the 
counter-culture movement. The second essay, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Going to Lose that Girl: The 
Beatles and the Girl Groups&rdquo; by Jacqueline Warwick, takes a critical stance 
toward Beatles studies focusing exclusively on harmonic innovation and on their 
&ldquo;mature&rdquo; style (implicitly <i>Rubber Soul</i> and beyond). She also implicitly 
criticizes male-centric perspectives that focus exclusively on the contributions 
to their early style by Buddy Holly, Little Richard and the Everly Brothers. As 
a partial corrective, she focuses on the influence of &ldquo;girl groupisms&rdquo; in their 
early music. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>covering girl group songs</li>
<li>copying girl group vocal textures and arrangements (e.g., comparing the 
Beatles&rsquo; &ldquo;Please Mister Postman&rdquo; and the Marvelettes original)</li>
<li>incorporating stylistic and generic girl group themes in their original songs 
(e.g., the &ldquo;advice song&rdquo; perspective in &ldquo;She Loves You&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Gonna Lose 
That Girl&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Her most eloquent cautionary notes come at the end: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><nobr> . . . </nobr>often the most interesting things in a pop song have little to do with the 
chord progressions. Indeed, the use of very conventional, predictable musical 
language is often a deliberate strategy, a choice made in order to appeal to 
listeners who don&rsquo;t see themselves primarily as rebels.<nobr> . . . </nobr>When we reserve 
our highest praise and respect for the innovations and inventiveness of the 
Beatles&rsquo;s late recordings, we come dangerously close to trivialising the early, 
mainstream records, the girls who bought them, and the girl music that 
influenced them. What&rsquo;s more, focussing so much on what the Beatles learned from 
Chuck Berry and Little Richard in terms of songwriting and instrumental 
techniques that we ignore what they learned from Girl Groups in terms of vocal 
harmonies and subject positions means that we don&rsquo;t fully understand what the 
Beatles were about. (166)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matthew Bannister in &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen &mdash;The Beatelles! The Influence of 
Sixties Girl Groups On The Beatles&rdquo; further supports this point: &ldquo;It seems 
likely that girl groups had a special appeal for women and the Beatles in some 
way reproduced and developed their performance modes and subject positioning to 
secure a wider audience. Their &lsquo;cuddly androgyny&rsquo; was a result, at least partly, 
of girl group influence.&rdquo; (178)</p>
<p>[9] Style and performance practice topics come together in a number of essays. 
The studies by Len McCarthy, &ldquo;Slow Down! How the Beatles Changed the Rhythmic 
Paradigm of Pop Rock,&rdquo; and Michael Hannan, &ldquo;Melodicism in Paul McCartney&rsquo;s Bass 
Playing,&rdquo; both highlight what an ethnomusicological perspective can bring to 
popular music research. In the first, using a sample size of hundreds of songs, 
McCarthy focuses on the relationship between tempo, measured in beats per 
minute, and &ldquo;feel,&rdquo; described as the rhythm&rsquo;s kinetic energy as a product of the 
subdivision of the beat and its accentuation. The clearest demonstration of this 
is his Table 1, in which he takes five songs with approximately the same tempo, 
but in which the feel progressively increases through a spectrum of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>slow - &ldquo;Golden Slumbers&rdquo;</li>
<li>medium slow - &ldquo;Rocky Raccoon&rdquo;</li>
	<li>medium fast - &ldquo;Come Together&rdquo;</li>
<li>fast - &ldquo;She came in Through the Bathroom Window&rdquo;</li>
<li>very fast - &ldquo;Polythene Pam&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>He demonstrates that the tempo and feel change markedly through the Beatles&rsquo; 
three periods, wherein Period 1 (1961&ndash;4) emphasizes fast tempi with a fast feel; 
Period 2 (1965&ndash;6) is transitional; and Period 3 (1967&ndash;70) features slower tempi 
with a fast feel. Equally significant is the Beatles&rsquo; influence on other 
artists, who by 1971 markedly shift to the groove preferences shown by the 
Beatles in their late period. In the second essay, Hannan explores McCartney&rsquo;s 
virtual explosion in melodic bass playing from around 1966 on. The author cites 
three factors contributing to his innovative playing, of which the primary one 
appears stunningly simple: beginning with <i>Rubber Soul,</i> he overdubbed his bass 
part. This resulted in his being able to &ldquo;try out different, often more 
flamboyant approaches to a particular bass part and he often recorded these basslines when the other Beatles were not present.<nobr> . . . </nobr>This represents a good 
example of a creative or performance practice changing as a result of changes in 
the technology and techniques of recording.&rdquo; (234&ndash;5) The other factors cited are 
the change from the famous Hofner to the Rickenbacker bass, which had a more 
fluid action and more cutting tone, and his tendency toward more ornate bass 
lines on songs for which he was not the primary writer, the theory being he was 
more willing to take risks for those tunes he did not compose himself.</p>
<p>[10] One final essay studies the crucial influence of studio technique on style 
and performance practice. In &ldquo;John Lennon&rsquo;s and Paul McCartney&rsquo;s Different Ways 
of Recording in the Studio (Exemplified by &lsquo;Strawberry Fields Forever&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Penny Lane&rsquo;),&rdquo; Rolf Berger clarifies an important element in the balance of 
opposing forces of the individual Beatles as a group. For &ldquo;Penny Lane,&rdquo; 
McCartney worked all night alone in the studio recording the piano tracks, and 
he was in control of virtually every detail of the song, exemplifying his 
precise and craftsmanlike studio approach. Regarding &ldquo;Strawberry Fields,&rdquo; the 
song significantly changes in character and style from beginning through some 
twenty-six takes until the final product; this characterizes Lennon&rsquo;s 
predilections for imagination, spontaneity, and, sometimes, frustrating 
vagueness and the consequent reliance on producer George Martin to realize his 
artistic vision in practical musical terms.</p>
<p>[11] Given the Beatles&rsquo; deserved place in the history of popular music and, more 
broadly, twentieth-century music and culture, it may well be killjoying on my 
part to complain about hagiography. And yet, their iconic status itself can 
prevent one from taking an appropriately critical perspective. In Tim Riley&rsquo;s 
keynote &ldquo;Drive My Car: 60s Soulsters Embrace Lennon-McCartney,&rdquo; the author 
essentially holds up the Beatles&rsquo; performances of their own songs as a 
touchstone and unattainable benchmark, to which any cover versions (he cites 
Wilson Pickett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hey Jude,&rdquo; Todd Rundgren&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strawberry Fields,&rdquo; and 
Earth Wind and Fire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Got to Get You Into My Life&rdquo;) inevitably come up short. 
While Riley&rsquo;s general erudition and his readings of covers in both 
directions&mdash;early Beatles covering other artists, and contemporary and subsequent 
artists covering the Beatles&mdash;are illuminating, his &ldquo;boosterism&rdquo; seems at times a 
little overdone.</p>
<p>[12] This does not detract from the overall interest and quality in the 
collection. While this volume may prove difficult to locate (I was not able to 
locate <i>Beatlestudies</i> 1 or 2), it would be worthwhile for anyone teaching a 
course on the Beatles, the history of popular music, or its intersection with 
popular culture, social change, sexual identity construction, and the many other 
topics explored here. More personally, the Beatles have provided a soundtrack 
for many events and stages in my life, and I suspect the same is true for others 
as well. Long live the Beatles&mdash;may they continue to inspire us to listen to, 
play, and think about their music.</p>
