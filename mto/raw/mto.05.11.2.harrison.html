<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The transformation of Hugo Riemann from obsolete pedant to 
influential thinker has been one of the most remarkable developments in North 
American music theory within the past twenty years. Those who have been 
intellectually and musically formed by Schenkerian ideas have likely not 
welcomed this development, since the views of Schenker on Riemann&mdash;the great <i>
Un-Ohr</i>&mdash;were strong and unambiguous. Indeed, the relegation of Riemann&rsquo;s 
theoretical ideas to risible futility was a kind of recreational activity among 
ardent Schenkerians. Oswald Jonas, for example, after arguing for the 
uselessness of function theory and noting that &ldquo;such harmonic hearing and 
interpretation can even surpass a manner of composing&mdash;although the two are 
obviously interdependent,&rdquo; cites a passage from a string quartet by Max Reger&mdash;the 
great <i>Gegenbeispieler</i>&mdash;analyzed in the Riemannian way. &ldquo;Need anything 
further be added?,&rdquo; he sarcases in the following, one-sentence paragraph.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p>
[2] 
The ascendancy of Schenkerian theory in America in the 1960s did not displace a 
previous Riemannian episteme, for Riemann&rsquo;s ideas had already lost whatever 
purchase they had on American theory long before, the decisive event likely 
being the First World War. Before that calamity, Americans seeking advanced training 
in composition (and, therefore, theory) generally sought it in Germany (e.g., MacDowell, Chadwick) and brought back German methods of instruction. As 
Riemannian ideas began to be widely adopted in Germany in the years before the 
war, they started to show up on these shores (e.g., Dirk Haagman&rsquo;s <i>Tonal 
Function: Harmony, Scales, and Intervals,</i> the first volume of which was 
published in 1916).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> But the war exposed North Americans to powerful 
anti-German propaganda of a then unprecedented force: not only was sauerkraut 
restyled as &ldquo;liberty cabbage&rdquo; and the city of Berlin, Ontario, renamed Kitchener 
over the objections of its inhabitants, but all things German were subject to 
patriotic disapproval, leading even to the public abuse of German-speaking 
immigrants and their descendents. After such a dose of cultural vitriol, it is 
hardly surprising that the second volume of Haagman&rsquo;s book never appeared, that 
Copland, Piston, and other post-war composers journeyed to France instead of 
Germany, and that Riemann&rsquo;s ideas gained no new advocates on this side of the 
Atlantic.</p>
<p>[3] The rehabilitation and neo-logizing of Riemann occurred thanks to David 
Lewin&rsquo;s admirable ability to adopt (or at least try out) a <i>modus audiendi</i> from 
historical music theory. His 1982 article &ldquo;A Formal Theory of Generalized Tonal 
Functions&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> took the fun out of Riemann jokes, and subsequent important work 
by Lewin, his students, and other interested scholars succeeded in making them 
politically incorrect. The culmination of the first phase of revisionist 
activity was Richard Cohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;survey and historical perspective&rdquo; that prefaced an 
issue of the <i>Journal of Music Theory </i>devoted to neo-Riemannian topics,<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> which 
artfully connected current theoretical projects to historical precedents&mdash;an 
activity at which Riemann himself was particularly adept. Now, Alexander Rehding&rsquo;s
<i>Hugo Riemann and the Birth of Modern Musical Thought </i>completes the 
process with a richly detailed backstory that prepares us for new stages of 
inquiry. It also restores some of the better punchlines.</p>
<p>[4] Hugo Riemann is an excellent subject for an intellectual history: he was a 
<i>Vielschreiber, </i>cranking out all manner of publications from treatises to essays 
for give-away calendars; he was rooted in the philosophical thought of his time 
and bore fruit predictably characteristic of the <i>terroir</i>; and he was both 
tendentious and stubborn, which prompted him frequently to maintain questionable 
positions past the point of plausibility, exposing thereby a complete range of 
strengths and weaknesses for critics to inspect. Rehding&rsquo;s book does for Riemann 
very much what Thomas Christensen&rsquo;s did for Rameau, providing intellectual 
context and even re-animation for a figure whose achievements have long since 
been sorted and absorbed by the discipline. Moreover, not only is context 
provided, but also a sense of the flawed human being within the context, a more 
sympathetic and intriguing figure than that of the impersonal agent of 
Intellectual History. Both Riemann and Rameau, in their respective authors&rsquo; 
hands, are captured in informal poses&mdash;their theories unbuttoned and ideas 
uncombed. These pictures are skillfully extracted as the underpainting of the 
formal self-portraits offered in these thinkers&rsquo; many writings. 
Nineteenth-century standards of living and work having endowed Riemann with a 
larger canvas, his self-presentation to history has, if less color than 
Rameau&rsquo;s, then more detail&mdash;and more flaws. As a result of this difference in 
scale, Rehding maintains a constant focus on his subject, yet he also populates 
his narrative with an ensemble cast of figures who can assist the reader in 
understanding the sources and influences of Riemann&rsquo;s ideas. In this way is he 
able to make fascinating the ideas, writings, and circumstances of a German 
academic of the last century, whose chief accomplishments resulted from strongly 
held yet questionable opinions and an industriousness that we would today call workaholism.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> So engaging is this narrative, clearly written and graced with 
belle-lettristic touches, that a movie version ought to be optioned.</p>
<p>[5] Consider, for example, this opening scene as scripted by Rehding: &ldquo;During a 
silent night in 1875, the young musicologist Hugo Riemann struck a key on his 
grand piano. He was listening for undertones, which he believed to exist in the 
sound wave&rdquo; (15). What he heard that night is a mystery. He claimed to have 
heard &ldquo;something very distinct.&rdquo; Were they undertones? Couldn&rsquo;t be. But whatever 
he did hear, or claimed he did hear, was proffered as undertones. That others 
could not replicate his experimental results was unfortunate&mdash;for them; maybe 
they needed a better kind of piano. With such an attitude, Riemann appears to be 
the stereotypical Mad Scientist tinkering away in his private laboratory. Rehding writes: &ldquo;The image of Riemann hearing undertones has become a derisory 
emblem of theoretical hermeticism, coupled with a level of wrong-headedness that 
is so much beyond our comprehension that ridiculing the approach seems to be the 
only way to cope with the sheer absurdity&rdquo; (17). Perhaps Gene Wilder is 
available to play Dr. Riemann.</p>

<p>[6] What was at stake with undertones? As is well known, Riemann wished to found 
the minor triad on the same acoustical principles as the major; whereas only the 
latter could be extracted as a subset from the overtone series, the former must 
needs for Riemann be a subset of the undertone series, which he then endeavored 
to hear on that fateful night. Thus, from a fundamental C<sub>4</sub> emerges both the 
major triad C&ndash;E&ndash;G in the 6th octave and the minor triad C&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;F in the 0th, like 
so: (see <b>Example 1</b>). Both triads being derived from the same fundamental, both should benefit 
equally, Riemann believed, from the usual synecdochic naming practice. That is, 
both ought to be recognized and named as types of C triads. The major, 
over-chord, Riemann labeled c+, and the minor, under-chord, he labeled -c. And 
from this principle of <i>harmonic dualism </i>he famously constructed a new 
language&mdash;alphabet and vocabulary&mdash;for his beloved Janus-monster. Rehding&rsquo;s 
central theme is to show how important this creature was for Riemann&rsquo;s entire 
project, and he succeeds in providing this much-needed corrective to the 
embarrassed impulse to isolate, hide, or otherwise dismiss dualism as just one 
of many Riemannian constructions, botched though it is. </p>
<p>[7] One of the few faults of Rehding&rsquo;s book is its Riemannian persistence in 
stuffing into a single bag any musical object prefixed with the adjective 
&ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;minor.&rdquo; Triads, keys, scales, systems, and sometimes compositions 
are all lumped together according to their modal adjective. To be sure, such 
adjectives do indicate a relation among these things, but Riemann, Rehding, and 
others frequently fail to differentiate among them, so that all things major (or 
all things minor) end up being fundamentally the same, and as a result nouns are 
interchanged freely in discussion. When Rehding writes that &ldquo;harmonic dualism is 
the postulate of theoretical equivalence between major and minor systems&rdquo; (28), 
is not the correct noun, in light of Dr. Riemann&rsquo;s nighttime experiments, 
&ldquo;triads&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;systems&rdquo;? A few pages later, terms have shifted again: 
&ldquo;harmonic dualism is the attempt to declare the major and minor modes as 
natural,&rdquo; and, further down the page, it is a kind of outlook that &ldquo;seeks to 
present the minor system as equivalent to the major system&rdquo; (31).</p>
<p>[8] Contrast this looseness with the careful wording in the following quotation 
from Helmholtz, which Rehding cites as one of the motivating sources for 
Riemann&rsquo;s dualism:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>This assertion that the minor system is much less consistent than the major will 
be combated by many modern musicians, just as they have contested the assertion 
already made by me, and by other physicists before me, that minor triads are 
generally inferior in harmoniousness to major triads. (21; Helmholtz, 301)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[9] The minor system is less &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; than major, while the minor triad is 
less &ldquo;harmonious.&rdquo; Undoubtedly, the inferior harmoniousness of the minor triad 
contributes to the inconsistencies of the minor system, but the precise nature 
of this contribution is too frequently not spelled out, leaving questions of 
dependence and priority up in the air: is the minor system, for example, 
synthesized from pre-existing parts, or is it presented through compositions and 
analyzed into parts that depend on their systemic membership for existence?</p>
<p>[10] The question may be thought pedantic; if only Riemann himself were so 
careful about the differences! Rehding is surely right in pointing to Riemann&rsquo;s 
fundamental interest supporting the compositional equality&mdash;or rather, the equal 
<i>availability</i> for composition&mdash;of major and minor keys and their systems. And he 
is also right to emphasize Helmholtz&rsquo;s findings about the unequal 
&ldquo;consistencies&rdquo; of the respective systems as the cause for the mad striking of 
piano strings in the dead of night. But was Riemann really constrained to 
address this inequality through triads? All of his various dualistic hypotheses 
focus their anxiety upon these structures, as if showing their &ldquo;equality&rdquo; would 
vouchsafe the aesthetic equality of keys and the compositions in these keys.</p>
<p>[11] Clearly, Riemann believed&mdash;along with Hauptmann, Oettingen, and 
others&mdash;that the whole system is essentially the sum of its parts, that the 
major key, for example, is built from the union of the major primary triads, 
such as (for C major): F&ndash;a&ndash;C&ndash;e&ndash;G&ndash;b&ndash;D. Triads first, then key (through union), 
and then scale (through reordering). But Hemholtz, for one, offered a different 
way, essentially similar to F&eacute;tis&rsquo;s culturally sensitive reading of tonality: 
scale, a synthetic entity derived from compositions, precedes key, which 
precedes triad. What is more, &ldquo;the system of scales, modes, and harmonic tissues 
does not rest solely upon inalterable natural laws, but is also, at least 
partly, the result of esthetical principles, which have already changed, and 
will still further change, with the progressive development of humanity.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Rehding 
devotes many well-researched pages explaining that Riemann could not be at all 
comfortable with this statement, but he does not critique why his answer to it 
had to take the particular form that it did.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[12] The confusion of terms becomes problematic in Rehding&rsquo;s further 
interpretation of Helmholtz&rsquo;s positions. He quotes a lengthy passage from 
Helmholtz, which he describes as &ldquo;added&rdquo; to Helmholtz&rsquo;s account of modal 
differences (though actually integral to it) as well as &ldquo;sound[ing] somewhat 
like a consolation prize&rdquo; (though it is of great aesthetic import):</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>But I am by no means of [the] opinion that this character [i.e., the 
	lesser consistency of minor compared to major] depreciates the minor system. 
	The major mode is well suited for all frames of mind which are completely 
	formed and clearly understood, for strong resolve, and for soft and gentle 
	or even for sorrowing feelings, when the sorrow has passed into the 
	condition of dreamy and yielding regret. But it is quite unsuited for 
	indistinct, obscure, unformed frames of mind, or for the expression of the 
	dismal, the dreary, the enigmatic, the mysterious, the rude, and whatever 
	offends against artistic beauty;&mdash;and it is precisely for these that we 
	require the minor mode, with its veiled harmoniousness, its changeable 
	scale, its ready modulation, and less intelligible basis of construction. 
	The major mode would be an unsuitable form for such purposes, and hence the 
	minor mode has its own proper artistic justification as a separate system. 
	(Helmholtz, 302).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[13] Rehding&rsquo;s commentary on the passage:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>But a justification as a separate system is precisely what the minor mode did 
not obtain from Helmholtz. Just as the acoustical inferiority of the minor triad 
was explained&mdash;with a barrage of feminising adjectives&mdash;by its dependency on the 
acoustical <i>Klang</i> (sonority), which corresponds to the major triad, so the 
aesthetic effects of the minor mode, too, depend on what the major mode is 
capable of signifying. The minor mode is only of aesthetic use for that which is 
excluded by the major mode. Both acoustically and aesthetically, the minor 
system remains fundamentally no more than a failed major mode (21).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[14] Is this reasoning Riemann&rsquo;s or Rehding&rsquo;s? Certainly, the last sentence has 
the sound of a Riemann panic-attack, found elsewhere in his writings, in which 
modal anxieties heat up and bubble over. Note that Helmholtz nowhere mentions 
anything about the &ldquo;failure&rdquo; of minor, but on the contrary firmly fails to 
&ldquo;depreciate&rdquo; it. And there is also the curious matter of the &ldquo;feminising 
adjectives&rdquo; (presumably &ldquo;indistinct, obscure, unformed&rdquo;) predicated to the minor 
<i>triad</i>&mdash;when it is clear that Helmholtz is writing about the minor <i>mode.</i> Again, 
we witness Riemann&rsquo;s <i>Klang</i>-obsessed modal myopia, but has Rehding, through long 
and loving contact with his subject, also been similarly affected? (I almost 
wrote &ldquo;infected&rdquo;!)</p>
<p>[15] Helmholtz also loses credit at the end of Rehding&rsquo;s dualism story. Noting 
that &ldquo;hardly any living theorist would consider harmonic dualism a viable 
solution&rdquo; to problems of modal ontology, Rehding writes:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>While the clashes between overtones and beatings of summation tones are still 
the same as in Helmholtz&rsquo;s day, we have taken the other avenue, and tend to 
disregard acoustical science altogether when talking about major and minor 
harmonies. With this music-theoretical paradigm shift, however, harmonic dualism 
became redundant; it became an attempt to answer a question that no longer 
interests us. (32)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[16] But this is because the question is settled&mdash;and Helmholtz got it right. It 
is not the case that dualism is no longer a fashionable music-theory ideology 
because we have &ldquo;moved on&rdquo;; it was wrong from the beginning, based on sloppy 
reading, faulty reasoning, and irreproducible science. That it got as far as it 
did is largely due to Riemann&rsquo;s industry and, to be fair, his gradually more 
sophisticated understanding of modal issues over time. But it hardly survived 
Riemann himself, and savvy function theorists were able to strip it out even 
before his passing.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Moreover, as Rehding points out (18), dualism was hardly 
without vigorous critics in Riemann&rsquo;s own day,<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> and even Rehding&rsquo;s own 
detailed look at Riemann&rsquo;s work-project does not shrink from showing the very 
tenuous if not plain bad thinking that went into tying all its parts together. 
It is not that the question was ultimately uninteresting, but that Riemann&rsquo;s 
answer was unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>[17] Ironically, the most productive arguments about minor that Helmholtz 
advanced go unmentioned by Rehding and, to my knowledge, by Riemann as well: 
that a well-defined minor mode comes late in the history of music; that it had 
difficulty being accommodated in poly- rather than monophonic styles;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> that 
there is a marked preference in both popular and art repertories (especially 
Viennese Classicism) for the major as the principal key of a work; and that the 
device of Picardy third (read by Helmholtz as &ldquo;avoidance of minor close&rdquo;) 
indicates a structural preference for major over minor.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
About this last phenomenon, Helmholtz writes that &ldquo;it was not until composers 
ventured to put a minor chord at the close of compositions written in the minor 
mode [in the middle of the 18th century], that the musical feeling of European 
musicians and hearers can be admitted to have become perfectly and surely 
habituated to the new system&rdquo; (Helmholtz, 365). This sophisticated argument, 
both empirical and historical, was the final outcome of Helmholtz&rsquo;s modal 
investigations; having determined that minor was less consistent a system than 
major, he then ventured some observations about the artistic consequences. These 
he would admit as being tentative: &ldquo;I must request the reader to regard this 
section [on the history of music] as a mere compilation from secondary sources; 
I have neither time nor preliminary knowledge sufficient for original studies in 
this difficult field&rdquo; (Helmholtz, vii). Such recognition of his limitations 
prevented him from wondering in print whether the increased use of the minor 
system might correlate to an increased interest in expressing &ldquo;the dismal, the 
dreary, the enigmatic, the mysterious, the rude, and whatever offends against 
artistic beauty.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[18] Riemann, too, was interested in history, but in what seems like a 
self-serving way:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>But I think that the actual purpose of historical research is to make 
recognisable that which is a primordial law in all ages, governing all 
perception and artistic creation. There is still enough left to characterise 
specifically the age from which the works stem. (91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this attitude that caused him to locate the origins of polyphony in 
England (Wales, actually), to read Zarlino as a dualist, and to elevate a minor 
18th-century thoroughbassist, J. F. Daube, to a major figure in the history of 
harmony. Rehding analyzes Riemann&rsquo;s positions as a historian with splendid 
critical sympathy, and he moreover connects these positions across the entire 
range of Riemann&rsquo;s interests, so that no one area can be said to be fundamental.</p>
<p>[19] The only fundamentals, then, are the &ldquo;primordial laws,&rdquo; and Rehding 
rightly stresses Riemann&rsquo;s complex relationship to them. These laws are not 
specifically musical laws, but rather laws of perception (physiology, 
psychology) and of cognition (psychology, epistemology). They are laws 
pertaining to the human condition, and Riemann thus positions himself to carry 
out the polymathic work of uncovering, elucidating, and even enforcing these 
laws in the jurisdiction of music.</p>
<p>[20] Heinrich Schenker comes immediately to mind as another theorist who claimed 
this kind of insight, and comparing notes on their respective ideologies is an 
interesting dialectical exercise. While Schenker identified himself as an 
Artist, Riemann&mdash;despite having composed and published over 60 opus numbers 
during his lifetime<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>&mdash;was clearly on the side of Science. For Schenker, the 
law of music resided in the tones themselves, and master composers were those 
who were successful mystic mediums, who brought forth art in their act of 
obedience. Riemann, too, esteemed the master composers as law-abiding paragons, 
yet they were as susceptible to error as any human being, especially so when it 
came to the notation of their works. For notation was essentially transcription, 
a second-order representation that could only imperfectly represent the 
first-order idea, which resided in the psyche of a listening composer. On this 
point, the contrast between Schenker and Riemann can be made even more vivid, 
for both produced editions of Beethoven piano sonatas founded on their 
respective positions. Schenker&rsquo;s edition inaugurated what we today regard as 
exemplary editorial practices, as Carl Schachter explains:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>[Schenker] was the first consciously to reproduce, as far as it is possible in 
print, the visual impression of the autograph. In other words he tried to be 
faithful not only to the contents of the work but also to the form in which the 
autograph presents them to the eye of the viewer. Very often Beethoven writes in 
a manner contrary to standard notational practice. Most editors before Schenker 
simply &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; these irregularities without realizing that they were 
possibly blocking access to an understanding of the composition. (Preface to 
Dover edition, vol. I, page vi.)</p>
</blockquote>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="harrison_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="harrison_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>Riemann, from his vantage point, would not only deny that such notational 
idiosyncrasies were access points, but also would maintain that even 
conventional notation blocked access to the contents, which in any case were not 
to be found in the autograph, but in the mind of the listener (with the composer 
being the original listener). His mission, when editing works, was to represent 
the proper relation of the published work to the actual, law-abiding original. 
His editorial interventions were thus analytic acts, designed to show the 
conformity of the artwork to the laws of phrasing and dynamics. The treatment of 
the second theme of op. 14, no. 1, first movement perfectly illustrates his 
methodology (see <b>Example 2</b>). The top staves are Riemann&rsquo;s, and the bottom are Schenker&rsquo;s. Skipping tedious detail about the analytic meaning of Riemann&rsquo;s various 
articulation signs, I focus instead on what happens in final two bars. In a 
footnote, Riemann acknowledges that Beethoven&rsquo;s original is as Schenker has it, 
but that the situation involves phrase-motivic overlap&mdash;hence, the crossed 
slurs. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr><sup>5</sup> is at once the end of a motive (because it resolves F 
double-sharp), and the 
anacrustic beginning of another (the thesis point being the octave below, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr><sup>4</sup>). 
This analytic truth, which the ear knows at once, is given a notational 
existence by means of a &ldquo;doubled&rdquo; <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr><sup>5</sup>. Why edit this way? Riemann writes:</p>
<blockquote>This new method of notation is a running commentary, a detailed thematic 
analysis of the works. It prevents a defective or faulty conception of the same 
and indicates instead proper expression, doing away with the need for 
reflection. It eases the work of the teacher in an unprecedented way and makes 
possible for one without a teacher to progress without making serious errors. 
In this way the author offers the beginner an indispensable relief in working 
out phrasing, while offering the advanced player new technical problems to 
solve.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>[21] Beneath the somewhat shocking hope that performers might dispense with 
&ldquo;reflection&rdquo; is the fact that Riemann&rsquo;s edition is essentially Beethoven 
rendered in analytic notation&mdash;obviously not &ldquo;reductive&rdquo; like Schenkerian 
analysis, but nonetheless no different in its use of noteheads and symbols to 
convey structural truth about the music. In later and more well-known work with 
Beethoven sonatas, which involved detailed harmonic and phrase-motivic analysis, 
Riemann would even rebar passages in order to bring out other such truths.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
Rehding does not shrink from claiming, rightly, that Riemann &ldquo;tampered with the 
notation in order to <i>preserve</i> the integrity of the music&rdquo; (163). </p>
<p>[22] Finally, like Schenker, Riemann was anxious about the continuing integrity 
of the primordial laws. Schenker, who imagined himself standing before a 
&ldquo;Herculaneum and Pompeii of Music,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> believed that knowledge of the law had 
passed away (with Brahms), and that composers of his day were either frauds or 
hopeless wannabes from whom God had permanently turned his face. Riemann, 
writing a generation earlier, felt the rumbles of the volcano and, in a 
Riemannian image that Rehding uses imaginatively, foresaw a expulsion from an &ldquo;Edenic 
garden&rdquo; that an eventual explosion would cause (or, rather, the explosion would 
be brought about by the willful departure from the garden). The tragedy in this 
was that the garden offered an inexhaustible number of paths and byways: 
&ldquo;everybody may then find new side paths for himself leading to ever new 
perspectives on regions never entered before&rdquo; (105).<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> There was no point in 
leaving&mdash;unless one was ignorant or had a kind of criminal intent. As to the 
former condition, Riemann saw the remedy in proper pedagogy, and the whole of 
his text- and handbook output can be seen in this light as cultural prophylaxis. 
Indeed, in Max Reger Riemann initially believed that he had the model of a 
properly educated and responsible artist who could show the world how to play 
happily in the garden. The relationship was so important that Reger even boarded 
at Riemann&rsquo;s home until an argument with Frau Riemann necessitated his own 
expulsion. Even so, as Rehding recounts, Riemann continued to believe in Reger 
until the erstwhile pupil, a troubled and unstable soul, proved unable to bear 
his teacher&rsquo;s hopes and turned on him in print by declaring his allegiance with 
the &ldquo;degenerates.&rdquo; A criminal act of betrayal! Not a paragon of prelapsarian 
joy, but, as Schenker pegged him for very much the same reasons, a <i>Gegenbeispieler.</i> In the matter of Music 
<i>v. </i>Reger, the two great if 
self-appointed judges, who agreed on almost nothing else, condemned the accused.</p>
<p>[23] Riemann was gentler with musical cultures which did not know any better. 
Although the primordial laws were true in all times and places (like those of 
other sciences), the progress of musical art in Europe was characterized by 
productive change with a few unfortunate wrong turns&mdash;the bass-upwards 
conception of chord structure, exemplified in Roman-numeral systems, being chief 
among them. Non-European cultures, not having made the correct turn into full 
harmonic understanding (marked by recognition of the importance of the major 
third), were left with more or less unproductive musical systems. Towards the 
end of his career, as he attained a less pedantic intellectual outlook, he could 
examine some of these in <i>Folkloristische Tonalit&auml;tsstudien </i>with something 
approaching critical sympathy. Rehding devotes some pages to this previously 
obscure area of Riemannian thought, and it is a welcome broadening of Riemann&rsquo;s 
intellectual biography. (It also is a object lesson for modern-day scholars: 
despite his well-documented limitations, Hugo Riemann was an industrial-strength 
research machine who worked until death wherever the primordial laws needed him. 
His record of production will likely never be broken.)</p>
<p>[24] A better known consequence of the late intellectual outlook is the theory 
of <i>Tonvorstellungen</i>&mdash;variously translated in the literature; Rehding&rsquo;s somewhat 
reluctant choice of &ldquo;Tone Imagination&rdquo; is a good one. Stimulated by study of 
late Beethoven and very likely, as biographer Michael Arntz has discovered,<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
Riemann&rsquo;s own increasing hearing loss, this turn epitomized the psychologizing 
tendency in Riemann&rsquo;s work, and made absolutely clear that music &ldquo;signified for 
Riemann not merely the sounding phenomenon, but rather the whole process of 
transplanting the musical thought of the composer into the musical mind of the 
listener. Sounding music was merely the intermediary stage&mdash;the beginning and 
end of the process were tone imaginations&rdquo; (166). Thus, tone imagination was, as 
Riemann himself put it, the &ldquo;Alpha and Omega of musical artistry.&rdquo; Although Rehding revisits this well-known site and does not dig up anything 
extraordinarily new, he does map the paths leading to it from other parts of the 
Riemannian terrain, and in so doing gives us a better appreciation of its 
origins and purposes.</p>
<p>[25] In fact, almost everything that Rehding does in this book increases 
appreciation for Riemann, despite his unsparing criticism of many aspects of his 
subject&rsquo;s thought. He refuses, for example, simply to dismiss harmonic dualism 
with harsh words, but rather examines it deeply and in good faith before letting 
its own contradictions lead to the proper conclusions. He even goes so far as to 
enlist Hans Vaihinger and his philosophy of the &ldquo;As-if&rdquo; to help out with the 
undertone series, which is tried out as a &ldquo;productive fiction,&rdquo; something unreal 
but nonetheless a &ldquo;useful basis for science <i>as if</i> the fiction were real&rdquo; because 
it enabled continued investigation into a matter of interest (86). Such is the 
scope and sympathy of Rehding&rsquo;s project that in his hands Hugo Riemann is fully 
rehabilitated as an interesting musical thinker.</p>
<p>[26] But is he a modern musical thinker? There is something puzzling about 
Rehding&rsquo;s title, for the coupling of Riemann with &ldquo;modern musical thought&rdquo; (or 
at least its birth) is an uncomfortable one. Such a reading would not allow us 
to assess as modern, for example, 
Riemann&rsquo;s mildly politicized musicology pitting Anglo-Saxony against Latiny and 
Germany against Austria. Much of this went the way of the <i>Pickelhaube</i> and now 
seems just as antique.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> Rehding&rsquo;s summary justification for his title (182&ndash;5) 
does, however, seem to place Riemann within the purview of current, modern 
concerns. Consider: Riemann&rsquo;s &ldquo;conceit that tonality constitutes a timeless 
structure supplanted Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph F&eacute;tis&rsquo;s earlier, historically contingent, 
definition of the term, and tonality is still commonly understood in this ahistorical sense in the academy&rdquo; (183). While true that tonality has undergone 
a certain reification in a vaguely Riemannian direction (i.e., &ldquo;functional 
harmony&rdquo;), and while true that few if any subscribe to F&eacute;tis&rsquo;s 
original construction, the concept (procedure? cultural construct? theoretical 
fiction?) is not at all out of play, and more-or-less silly academic fights 
about its nature erupt even today.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>
<p>[27] Rehding also positions Riemann as the Great Institutionalizer of musicology 
and theory, a figure who solidified the structures upon which disciplinary 
discourses (such as this review) could take place. There is something to this 
point, but its demonstration lies outside the scope of the book, which is 
concerned more with Riemann&rsquo;s thought than with an academized &ldquo;Riemann thought&rdquo; 
that grew up somewhat afterwards. Some of this is covered in Arntz&rsquo;s excellent 
biography, some in Chapter 8 of <i>Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music,</i> and some 
in Renate Imig&rsquo;s still valuable 1971 survey of post-Riemann function-symbol 
systems.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> But the full story is yet to be told, and the extent to which 
Riemann created or merely rode the wave of an institutionalized music study in 
Germany is still an open question.<br><br>[28] In the end, Rehding&rsquo;s book allows us finally to retire William C. 
Mickelsen&rsquo;s 1977 study (although his translation of the final part of Riemann&rsquo;s 
<i>Geschichte der Musiktheorie</i> may still be consulted in cases where the original 
is unavailable).<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> It also fills in my own lightly sketched isagoge that is 
Chapter 7 of <i>Harmonic Function in Chromatic Music</i> and rounds out material 
presented in Chapter 4 of David Kopp&rsquo;s <i>Chromatic Transformations in 
Nineteenth-Century Music.</i><sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Along with Arntz&rsquo;s biography, Rehding&rsquo;s book 
completes a detailed Riemann album sufficient, I suspect, not only for any 
present but also for any currently imaginable future purposes.</p>

<p align='left'>Before leaving the subject of Riemann and his predecessors, I should correct 
an apparent misreading of Moritz Hauptmann&rsquo;s minor-triad structures and 
explanations, which Robert Wason caught and pointed out to me. While not a 
full-gospel dualist, Hauptmann consistently thought about musical structures in 
dualistic, oppositional ways. The inversional relationship between major and 
minor triads was thus of great interest to him. In adapting his dialectical 
system (succinctly described by Rehding on page 24) to the minor triad, his first 
impulse was to invert the representation, so that the starting point, I, was 
reckoned from the upper note of the fifth, like so:</p>

	<table border='1' id='table4' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' bordercolor='#000000' width='200'>
		<tr>
			<td colspan='3' align='center' bordercolor='#000000'>

			<td align='center' width='66'><b>III</b></td>
			<td align='center' width='66'><b>&mdash;I</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<p align='left'>This analysis of the minor triad, shortened to <b>II&ndash;III&ndash;I</b>, is used throughout the 
rest of his book and seems to be entirely satisfactory. However, through some 
unexplained calculus, Hauptmann claims that the above structure &ldquo;is the same as&rdquo; 
the following analysis:</p>

	<table border='1' id='table5' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0' bordercolor='#000000' width='200'>

			<td align='center' width='66'><b>&mdash;III</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

<p align='left'>I will avoid a detour into Hauptmann&rsquo;s opposition of &ldquo;determine&rdquo; and &ldquo;is 
determined,&rdquo; which seems to be the way of balancing the equation of first and 
second figures, and instead point out that the two figures claim very different 
things. The second, in fact, is consonant with a &ldquo;co-generation&rdquo; theory of 
minor, in which the chord appears to have two &ldquo;roots&rdquo;: in this case, F and <?php flat(A)?>. 
Curiously, it is this figure that appears first in Rehding&rsquo;s discussion of the &ldquo;dialectial&rdquo; minor triad&mdash;as an inverted major. <br>
<br>
The following figure then appears in Rehding&rsquo;s book as an illustration of 
Hauptmann&rsquo;s &ldquo;alternative explanation of the minor triad, bottom-up but no longer 
dialectical&rdquo; (25):</p>

<p align='left'>This representation is found nowhere in Hauptmann, and is even at odds with 
Hauptmann&rsquo;s basic claims of interval intelligibility (that is, there is no 
intelligible relationship in the minor third F&ndash;<?php flat(A)?>.) Something has gone wrong 
here, and I suspect a kind of typographical error involving Rehding&rsquo;s examples, 
since the text commentary suits the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; versions of the examples much 
better. Since more readers of Rehding&rsquo;s book may be consulting this review than 
combing library stacks for a dusty copy of Hauptmann, I submit that discussing

dualistic systems besides the triad.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Rehding&rsquo;s extract leaves out the positive attributes of 
the major mode, quite understandable given the direction of his argument at that 
point. His redaction of the second and third sentences is: &ldquo;The major mode is 
quite unsuited&rdquo; etc. Also, in connection with Rehding&rsquo;s description of the 
passage as &ldquo;added,&rdquo; it is appropriate to note that the passage was in the first 
German edition (1863) of Helmholtz&rsquo;s treatise (page 463) and was not an addition

meantone temperament may have played a significant role here. The minor third of 
the tonic triad was quite sharp and hence &ldquo;much rougher&rdquo; than just, whereas the 
major third was just or nearly so. Helmholtz, 301.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">See Helmholtz, pages 301&ndash;2, 365, and vii.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">A Riemannian rebuttal of Helmholtz&rsquo;s arguments would, 
I am quite sure, involve evidence of composers treating the two modes in some 
equal fashion, and exhibit A would be the <i>Well-Tempered Clavier.</i> Here, the place
