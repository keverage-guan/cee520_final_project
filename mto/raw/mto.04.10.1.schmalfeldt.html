<a name="Introduction"></a>Introductory Remarks </h3>
<p>[1] It was an honor and a great pleasure to deliver a keynote address to the 
Society for Music Theory at its annual meeting in November of 2003. I&rsquo;m also 
grateful for the invitation to publish the address pretty much <i>as was</i> in <i>
Music Theory Online</i>. So that readers will know the extent to which &ldquo;live&rdquo; 
performance played a role in my presentation, MTO Editor Timothy Koozin 
has even encouraged me to preserve my indications as to when and what would be 
performed. Let me take this opportunity again to thank just-retired SMT 
President Betsy West Marvin for performing three songs with me; her 
contributions were exquisite.</p>
<p>
[2] A few SMT members who kindly offered words of critique to me after my 
presentation will be pleased, I hope, to note that I&rsquo;ve made some small but 
significant revisions in response. My reference to TV&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Mickey Mouse Club&rdquo; 
has been changed to a nod to Chicago White Sox games; my brother is right to 
point out that, when I was 16 and he was 12, he would certainly not still have 
been watching &ldquo;Mickey Mouse.&rdquo; Finally, I shall hope that this piece invites new 
responses and comments, and I&rsquo;ll very much look forward to these. </p><hr><br>
<h3>
<a name="keynote"></a>&ldquo;Coming Home&rdquo; </h3>
<p>
[3] It was a clever idea for the 2003 SMT Program Committee to choose a keynoter 
who would be virtually &ldquo;coming home&rdquo; to Wisconsin to give her address. As you 
can see, my topic today shamelessly takes its cue from that committee. I am 
indeed &ldquo;coming home&rdquo; this afternoon&mdash;not to my alma mater, but at least to the 
school whose Summer Music Clinic, for high schoolers, gave me my first break as 
a pianist. Of course I&rsquo;ve also been coming home, to a small town about ninety 
miles east of here, for family visits over many, many years. More to the point, 
my work in recent years represents another kind of homecoming: when, not so long 
ago, I turned to matters involving the European repertoire of the early 
nineteenth century, I was <i>re</i>turning in no small measure to some of the 
music with which I had grown up, especially at the keyboard. My effort at the 
SMT conference last year to examine formal processes in Schubert&rsquo;s music that 
enact a kind of &ldquo;turning inward&rdquo; was motivated as much as anything by the 
private question, Why have I always felt so very much &ldquo;at home&rdquo; with Schubert? A 
similar question lies at the heart of today&rsquo;s essay: this afternoon I seek 
musical answers for why the closing moments in many of Robert Schumann&rsquo;s 
compositions would seem for me to evoke the idea of yearning to &ldquo;come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
[4] Of course there is an obvious way in which most tonal pieces end by &ldquo;coming 
home&rdquo;: they tend to end in their &ldquo;home key.&rdquo; Just why that expression has become 
such a commonplace is a topic in its own right, and one that many of you have 
undoubtedly pondered. Who would deny that the metaphor of the tonic as &ldquo;home 
key&rdquo; <i>must</i> have something to do with a sentiment shared by so many 
cultures over so many centuries that it seems&mdash;dare I say&mdash;universal. &ldquo;Home&rdquo; is 
not just the place where we now live; it&rsquo;s also the place where we <i>first</i> 
lived, and thus it&rsquo;s the source of everything that our childhood meant to us. 
Needless to say, individuals whose childhoods were ravaged by abuse or deprived 
of love are not likely to want to return home. But if we were lucky, childhood 
was our garden of Eden before the Fall&mdash;the time when we trusted that our parents 
loved us unconditionally, when we believed that we would always be safe in their 
care. Time and place tend to merge here. For this small-town Midwesterner, 
childhood was the place where an out-of-tune Chickering piano shared the living 
room with an early version of the TV, where we kids played baseball after school 
in the open field next door, where, to this day, a solitary close-position triad 
in the middle register can make me remember the warning of the freight train 
that would come through town in the middle of the night. But &ldquo;home&rdquo; needn&rsquo;t be a 
particular place; for nomadic cultures, perhaps home is simply the comfort of 
food, family, and sleep at the end of the day. Nor must home be necessarily 
associated with a particular time; for those who have never left home, it&rsquo;s 
timeless. No wonder that the stability and sense of completeness tonic closure 
can convey has become associated with one of the most potent and consoling words 
in any language.</p>
<p>
[5] And yet, here&rsquo;s the thing. <i>Leaving</i> home, rather than staying home, has long 
been the norm for young adults in American society, and there&rsquo;s nothing 
essentially modern, or American, about this. If the Trojan War really did occur, 
then Homer&rsquo;s legendary Ulysses may have left home in the twelfth century B.C. 
The history of so-called civilization is the tale of one migration, voyage, 
crusade, expedition, exodus, emigration, expulsion, and deportation after 
another. In our last century alone&mdash;a century worn down by civil wars, military 
coups, totalitarian regimes, homelessness, two World Wars, and threats of a 
third&mdash;the plight of individuals as exiles or emigrants has yielded a powerful 
genre of its own in all the arts. To name just a few of the contributors, I 
think of Vladimir Nabokov&rsquo;s poignant <i>Speak, Memory</i>, of various poems and essays 
by Joseph Brodsky, of the writings of Theodor Adorno, Edward Said, Milan Kundera, 
and W.G. Sebald;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> and obviously I&rsquo;m only scratching the surface here. Whether or 
not the work of composers, performers, and music theorists reflects their status 
as &eacute;migr&eacute;s, I think of Rachmaninov, Stravinsky, Horowitz, Schoenberg, Bart&oacute;k, 
Krenek, Hindemith, Kurt Weill, Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, and the 
Schenkerians Felix Salzer, Ernst Oster, and Oswald Jonas. Consider the 
photographic series called &ldquo;Exiles&rdquo; by the Czechoslovakian Josef Koudelka, or 
the photos of global and national migrations by the Brazilian Sebasti&atilde;o Salgado.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
Perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen the recent film <i>Rabbit-Proof Fence</i>, in which three small 
&ldquo;half-caste&rdquo; Aborigine girls, abducted in the 1930s for the &ldquo;betterment&rdquo; of 
Australian society, escape and walk some 1,500 miles along the fence, to find 
their way home.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> If there is one thing that studies of dispossession would seem 
to share, it is the disturbing message that home is never the same once we leave 
it, especially if we never manage to return.</p>
<p>
[6]
But I&rsquo;m particularly concerned today with what &ldquo;home&rdquo; might have meant to 
Austrians and Germans in the early decades of the nineteenth century. By 1815 
the Congress of Vienna had marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and established 
a German Confederation under Austrian control. But now, as Nicholas Marston puts 
it, &ldquo;the repressiveness of [Prince] Metternich&rsquo;s police state created a 
heightened sense of separation between public and private spheres of action and 
expression.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> In his memoir of 1872, Schubert&rsquo;s friend Eduard von Bauernfeld 
looks back on life in Vienna in the 1820s and says: &ldquo;The police in general and 
censorship in particular weighed on us all like a monkey we could not get off 
our back.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Within this corrupt urban environment, where overcrowding and disease 
were everywhere and death was a daily event, where your neighbor might turn out 
to be a spy, home became sacred; it was the one place of refuge, comfort, and 
privacy, the safe haven where secrets could be shared, and where the upright 
pianoforte could accommodate performances of the most intimate of genres&mdash; the 
lyrical piano piece, the Lied, the sonata, and the piano duet. The bourgeois 
homemaker was of course the woman of the house, who usually stayed at home, and 
to whom the <i>pater familias</i> could retreat from public life at the end of 
the day; for men, &ldquo;family and home became the symbol of peace, tranquility, 
privacy, and male authority.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> </p>
<p>
[7]
In this light, it is especially touching to note that, of the many lodgings 
Franz Schubert shared with friends, none lasted long enough to be called his 
home. This detail is one of the many pointing to the likelihood that Schubert 
himself identified with the protagonist who sings &ldquo;Ich bin ein Fremdling &uuml;berall&rdquo; 
(I am a stranger everywhere) in the song &ldquo;Der Wanderer&rdquo; (D. 489), from 1816&mdash;the 
year of Schubert&rsquo;s first departure from his father&rsquo;s home.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> As the composer of 
song cycles, and as one who tremendously admired Conradin Kreutzer&rsquo;s setting 
(1818) of Ludwig Uhland&rsquo;s <i>Wanderlieder</i> poems (1813), Schubert might easily have 
jumped onto the Uhland type of <i>Wanderlieder</i> bandwagon. In the grand 
<i>Bildungsgeschichte</i> tradition of, for example, Goethe, Tieck, Novalis, and 
Eichendorff, Uhland&rsquo;s wanderer undertakes the quintessential German Romantic 
quest for self-awareness; his journey away from home both mirrors and enables 
the psychological process of coming to grips with absence, self-division, and 
alienation. The last song of the Uhland/Kreutzer cycle is called &ldquo;Heimkehr&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;homecoming&rdquo;; through the act of coming home, Uhland&rsquo;s wanderer 
achieves resolution and attains a higher level of appreciation for the beloved 
he had left behind.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> By contrast, Wilhelm M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s young man in <i>Die sch&ouml;ne 
M&uuml;llerin</i>, having left his home, apparently ends his own life when his beloved 
becomes unattainable; and M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s wanderer in <i>Die Winterreise</i>, far from going 
home, ends by identifying with a homeless street musician, the hurdy-gurdy 
player. <i>These</i> are the poetic cycles that occupied Schubert. Indeed, it may well 
be that Schubert&rsquo;s only meaningful homecoming happened to him in a dream. In a 
document that he entitled &ldquo;Mein Traum,&rdquo; discovered and published after his death 
by none other than Robert Schumann, Schubert tells in first person a story in 
which his father twice banishes him from home when he fails to partake of a 
feast. His second exile, which finds him wandering and singing for long, long 
years in a distant land, comes to a miraculous end when he finds himself 
transported back to what seems like home, to a father who is now loving and 
weeping, and to the sensation of eternal bliss.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> But remember: it was only a 
dream.</p>
<p>
[8]
Like Schubert, Robert Schumann was not encouraged by his family to pursue a 
musical career. His decision in 1830 to abandon the study of law in favor of 
music alienated him from his entire family and gave his mother a &ldquo;broken 
heart&rdquo;&mdash;these words from the woman to whom he was the most intensely attached.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
When, at age eighteen, Schumann departed from his childhood home in Zwickau to 
enter law school in the big city of Leipzig, his first letter to his mother 
expresses what certainly sounds like a touch of homesickness: &ldquo;I long with all 
my heart to return to my quiet home where I was born and have spent happy days 
in nature. Nature, where can I find it here? Everything is so artificial: there 
are no hills, no valleys, no woods <nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Although Schumann returned home often 
enough over the years to come, there are three occasions on which his absence 
from home must surely have seemed strange, and maybe these hark back to the 
death of his older sister, by suicide, and the death of his father, within just 
ten months when Robert was fifteen: perhaps because home had become painfully, 
even obsessively, associated with death for him, he could not bring himself to 
attend the funeral either of his brother Julius in 1833 or of his mother in 
1836, and he arrived home too late for his brother Eduard&rsquo;s funeral in 1839. On 
that return, he recorded the impression that his hometown &ldquo;was now completely 
extinct.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> When death comes to our childhood home, what was once idyllic can 
become the primal site of loss and greatest sadness. </p>
<p>
[9]
It is well known that the year 1840 became Schumann&rsquo;s <i>Liederjahr</i>, his &ldquo;Year of 
Song.&rdquo; This was the year that would eventually bring a successful outcome to the 
lawsuit against Clara Wieck&rsquo;s father that Robert and Clara had initiated for 
legal permission to marry. A hiatus in the formal proceedings against Wieck, and 
one during which Clara would be on tour in northern Germany, found Robert 
suddenly producing song after song in rapid succession&mdash;nearly 125 songs by the 
end of the year; John Daverio asserts that many of these, though by no means 
all, may be viewed as &ldquo;musical missives to the distant beloved, much like the 
piano music of the middle and later 1830s.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In fact it was Clara herself who 
selected the twelve poems from Joseph von Eichendorff&rsquo;s collected edition that 
would become the basis for the song cycle Robert regarded as his &ldquo;most 
profoundly romantic&rdquo;&mdash;the Eichendorff <i>Liederkreis</i>, Op. 39.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> At a time when Clara 
was away from home, and estranged from the father who ruled there, while Robert 
longed for the home he hoped soon to create with Clara, it may be no coincidence 
that the song eventually to become the first of the cycle speaks of 
homelessness, and that the cycle&rsquo;s most celebrated song enacts a transcendental 
flight &ldquo;nach Haus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
[10]
I refer of course to the first of two songs (Nos. 1 and 8) entitled &ldquo;In der Fremde&rdquo; 
and to Song No. 5, the ravishingly beautiful &ldquo;Mondnacht,&rdquo; in the key of 
E major. If you know Patrick McCreless&rsquo;s essay on the Eichendorff <i>Liederkreis</i> 
or David Ferris&rsquo;s very fine recent book on the same, or if you&rsquo;ve studied 
Charles Burkhart&rsquo;s superb analysis of &ldquo;Mondnacht,&rdquo; in the 1990 volume of <i>Schenker 
Studies</i>, you may wonder why I would dare to revisit this song today.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Luckily for 
me, none of those authors asks the question I&rsquo;d like to raise: From the striking 
manner in which Schumann sets Eichendorff&rsquo;s final words, &ldquo;nach Haus,&rdquo; what might 
we imagine that these words meant for Schumann? In other words, to what extent 
might the closing moments of Schumann&rsquo;s song hold the key to his reading of the 
poem as a whole?</p>

<p>
[11] To remind you about &ldquo;Mondnacht,&rdquo; I provide Eichendorff&rsquo;s poem and Schumann&rsquo;s 
setting in my handout at <b>Example 1</b>; the translation is by David Ferris.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> As 
you&rsquo;ll see, both in the score and at 
<b>Figure 1</b>, Schumann responds to Eichendorff&rsquo;s three-stanza poem by choosing the so-called 
<i>bar form</i>&mdash;the venerable 
<b>A-A'-B</b> scheme, whereby, in this case, an introduction and then a single 
eight-bar phrase, repeated (and labeled little <b>a</b>), provide the material for both 
of the <b>A</b>-sections and the final phrase of <b>B</b>. Why the bar form? Schumann&rsquo;s 
rationale is no less elegant for being obvious. In Eichendorff&rsquo;s first two 
stanzas, we have nothing more, or less, than a hushed, shimmering, moonlit 
Caspar David Friedrich landscape, in which, as if, once upon a time (<i>es war 
als</i>), heaven and earth converge in a kiss and the gentlest of breezes provides 
the only motion. By contrast, the third stanza mobilizes the poem&mdash;it carries us 
first inward, then outward and upward into the starry night: as if present all 
along, a first person emerges, and now that soul gains wings, like the soul in 
Plato&rsquo;s <i>Phaedrus</i>; expanding its wings, the soul &ldquo;flies through the quiet land, 
<i>as if</i> it were flying home.&rdquo; If ever the third stanza of a three-part poem were 
to beg in its musical setting for change and a new direction, here it is.</p>
<p>
[12]
Like the sixth and seventh songs of this <i>Liederkreis</i>, &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; makes a 
drastic departure &ldquo;from the norm of compositional practice,&rdquo; to quote Charles 
Burkhart. Its harmonic foundation &ldquo;lacks the normal initial tonic&rdquo;; instead, the 
complete song is &ldquo;based on the incomplete progression V-I,&rdquo; and thus the song 
exemplifies in its entirety what Heinrich Schenker called an &ldquo;auxiliary 
cadence.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> For Burkhart, the one-and-only structural home-tonic resolution comes 
&ldquo;precisely on the last word, &lsquo;Haus&rsquo; [home]&rdquo;; in short, says Burkhart, &ldquo;the poem 
seems almost to have been written for the very purpose of being recomposed in 
terms of an auxiliary cadence!&rdquo; Burkhart&rsquo;s exquisite series of voice-leading 
graphs explores this point on multiple levels of structure; with his permission, 
I reproduce two of his graphs&mdash;the one showing &ldquo;early levels&rdquo; and the one 
representing &ldquo;foreground&rdquo;&mdash;at my <b>Example 2</b>, a &amp; b. The Roman numerals in 
handwriting beneath the bass staff in Burkhart&rsquo;s graph at Example 2b have been added 
by me. </p>
<p>
[13] In Example 2b as well as in the score starting at measure 7, you&rsquo;ll note that, on the <i>most</i> foreground level, a descending-fifths sequence&mdash;<b>[<nobr>V<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>]-ii; <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>-I</b>&mdash;composes 
out Burkhart&rsquo;s more middleground <b>ii-V</b> progression (shown with my large Roman 
numerals). This in turn serves to prolong the background dominant over the span 
of the first vocal phase, and then again through each of its repetitions. 
Burkhart observes that in fact the <b>ii-V</b> progression already appears over the 
dominant pedal in the pianist&rsquo;s introduction; and this is just one of several 
astonishing ways in which the introduction anticipates the essential motivic 
components of the song proper. To the three motives that Burkhart identifies, 
I&rsquo;ve applied the following labels: <b>x</b>, for the neighbor motion <b><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-to-B</b> that 
establishes the primary tone <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b>; <b>y</b>, for the descending-3rd motion 
<b><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-E-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr></b>, which 
recurs in the pseudo-bass (lowest) voice at measures 8&ndash;9; and <b>z</b>, for the implied 
descending 4th <b>B-A-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr></b>, which returns as the primary descent <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>4</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> 
beneath the vocal line, as a &ldquo;cover-tone voice,&rdquo; over the span of measures 5&ndash;13.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Most 
astonishing, at least for me, is the manner in which the pianist&rsquo;s introduction 
portrays the forthcoming metaphor of the first stanza. Watch my two hands&mdash;as 
they begin far apart, within the extremes of bass and soprano register, but then 
<i>converge</i> in the middle register and then descend together (<b>PLAY: measures 1&ndash;5</b>). The 
image of the masculine &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Der Himmel</i>, or, rather, the rays of the moon 
itself&mdash;descending as if in wedded bliss to kiss the feminine &ldquo;earth&rdquo;, <i>Die Erde</i>, 
and to set her all aglow with dreams, must have been particularly moving to 
Robert and Clara, as they awaited the verdict that would determine the direction 
of their lives together. In a letter from Robert to Clara in April 1838, we even 
learn that Robert regarded the word &ldquo;Ehe&rdquo;&mdash;the German word for &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;&mdash;to be a 
&ldquo;musical word&rdquo;; its pitch equivalent is <b>E-B-E</b>, as heard in measures 10&ndash;11 in the bass 
and as <b>B-E-B</b> at the word &ldquo;die Erde.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[14] Clearly the momentous effect of section <b>B</b>, which begins at measure 45, has 
everything to do with the static quality of the dominant prolongation throughout 
sections <b>A</b> and <b>A'</b>. After 46 measures of hovering on dominant 
harmony, the motion to <b><nobr>V<sup>7</sup></nobr></b> of <b>IV</b> at measure 47 comes on the word &ldquo;spannte&rdquo; as if to expand the entire tonal 
universe; and here the radiant return of the introductory gesture, now in its 
highest register, miraculously creates the illusion of &ldquo;stretching&rdquo; the phrase 
over the great vocal divide between &ldquo;spannte&rdquo; and &ldquo;weit&rdquo; that ignores Eichendorff&rsquo;s poetic enjambment. When the subdominant at measure 51 moves to the 
motivically crucial supertonic, the <b>ii-chord</b> at measure 53, our opening vocal phrase 
now begins for the first and only time directly on that chord, and this time it 
behaves like the consequent phrase that we&rsquo;ve been expecting all along: via hemiola at measures 57&ndash;59, the singer now takes the descent 
&ldquo;home&rdquo; to scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> 
that has been avoided until the end.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> But, please, what about the pianist? </p>
<p>
[15] Let me now ask Betsy Marvin to join me in a performance of &ldquo;Mondnacht.&rdquo; In 
agreeing to do this, Betsy helps me perpetuate a plot in which I manage to 
arrange for past SMT Presidents to perform together (at last year&rsquo;s conference 
Thomas Christensen helped me present moments from Schubert&rsquo;s Piano Duet in A 
Minor, the &ldquo;<i>Lebensst&uuml;rme</i>&rdquo;). As Betsy and I approach the end of the song, I ask 
you please to consider carefully the manner in which Schumann achieves tonal 
closure and the effect that this creates. (We <b>PERFORM</b> the song.)</p>
<p>
[16] To say the obvious, the word &ldquo;Haus&rdquo; coincides for the pianist <i>not</i> 
with the cadential tonic, but rather with an inverted form of the secondary 
dominant that seemed to send the soul into orbit at measure 47&mdash;the <b><nobr>V<sup>7</sup></nobr></b> of <b>
IV</b>. In technical terms, let&rsquo;s say that an <i>evaded cadence</i> (<b>EC</b>) 
occurs at measure 59, and that this is followed by the <i>plagal</i> progression <b>
IV-I (PLAY)</b>. Burkhart&rsquo;s foreground graph at my Example 2b clearly displays this 
delayed arrival on root tonic at measure 61; but Example 2a suggests that, on the 
background level, he understands the delay to be the composing-out of a 
cadential tonic already fundamentally in effect at the word &ldquo;Haus&rdquo; in measure 59; and surely Schenker would have concurred. By contrast, David 
Ferris hears the passage at hand as a &ldquo;weakening of the harmonic progression&rdquo;; 
and this, in coordination with the &ldquo;disjunction between vocal melody and 
accompaniment&rdquo; at measure 59, creates an &ldquo;open ending&rdquo; for him.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Both authors address 
what Burkhart describes as the &ldquo;typically Eichendorffian idea of Man&rsquo;s yearning 
to be at one with Nature&rdquo;&mdash;a benign Nature, within which the protagonist &ldquo;moves 
toward a new state of being or a deepening of experience.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> But Ferris sees 
Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;open ending&rdquo; as capturing something of Eichendorff&rsquo;s intimation that 
the epiphanic flight of the soul can only be elusive, unreal, and transitory. 
For Ferris, Eichendorff&rsquo;s &ldquo;allusion to the soul&rsquo;s return home makes it clear 
that, within his earthly life, the narrator cannot achieve the convergence for 
which he yearns&rdquo;; this will happen only in death.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> In other words, and unless 
I&rsquo;ve misunderstood, &ldquo;nach Haus&rdquo; conveys a certain resignation, if not 
disappointment, in Ferris&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>
[17]
For me, Schumann&rsquo;s treatment of those highly charged words&mdash;&ldquo;nach Haus&rdquo;&mdash;has 
always conveyed something quite different: there&rsquo;s something about shooting 
<i>beyond</i> the goal of the home tonic&mdash;only then to settle upon it&mdash;that seems to make 
this arrival all the more powerful, satisfying, and transcendental. Schumann&rsquo;s 
coda then unquestionably confirms that, even if it&rsquo;s just a dream, the soul has 
arrived at the very place towards which it strove; fragments of the introductory 
gesture in the middle and low registers, and then a final liquidation of these, 
now all transposed into the realm of the home key, would seem to suggest that 
the wings of the soul now fold inward and come to rest. Here for me is a &ldquo;nach Haus&rdquo; that is 
<i>even better</i> than the childhood Garden of Eden we left behind, 
regardless of whether we can ever reclaim it, or recreate it, on this earth. In 
another letter from 1838, Robert writes to Clara: &ldquo;If I could only be as truly 
devoted as I was in childhood&mdash;I was really a happy child then, assembling chords 
at the piano, or picking flowers outside <nobr>. . .</nobr> But one grows older. Now I want to 
play with you, the way angels do together, from eternity to eternity.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Perhaps 
for Robert in the spring of 1840, still struggling to gain Clara&rsquo;s hand, Eichendorff&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;nach Haus&rdquo; meant being at home for a blissful eternity with 
Clara.</p>

Friedrich Wieck managed to sustain the legal battle against his daughter and 
Robert for an entire fourteen months; but by August of 1840 Wieck&rsquo;s <i>de facto</i> 
admission of defeat was made official, and now the wedding plans could get 
underway. Already by April of that year, Robert had completed a collection of 
songs to be presented to Clara as a wedding present; on September 7th, five days 
before the wedding, Robert paid for a &ldquo;lavishly bound copy&rdquo; of that collection; 
its title is <i>Myrthen</i> (myrtles&mdash;after the flower traditionally associated with 
German weddings), and it is dedicated: &ldquo;To my beloved bride.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> Appropriately, the 
first song of the group sets a poem by Friedrich R&uuml;ckert entitled &ldquo;Widmung&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Dedication&rdquo;; please find that song and a translation of its text at 
my <b>Example 3</b>. </p>
<p>
[19]
There is hardly any mystery about the &ldquo;du&rdquo; to whom Robert Schumann 
addresses R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s wonderful outpouring&mdash;&ldquo;Du meine Seele, du mein Herz, du meine 
Wonn&rsquo;, o du mein Schmerz,&rdquo; etc. Nor is it surprising that Schumann&rsquo;s music 
transforms R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s non-stanzaic, one-part poetic form into a musical small 
ternary <b>(A-B-A')</b>. R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s change of tone&mdash;or dynamic, as it were&mdash;at &ldquo;Du bist 
die Ruh&rsquo;, du bist der Frieden&rdquo; so beautifully invites Schumann&rsquo;s shift into the 
serene dream-world of <b>flat-VI</b> at the beginning of his <b>B</b>-section in 
<b>measure 14</b> 
(enharmonic E major, relative to the home tonic of A-flat); and his reprise of R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s opening four lines then inspires him to close the 
<b>A'</b>-section by 
jumping to the last, and most moving, line of the poem, &ldquo;Mein guter Geist, mein 
bessres Ich!&rdquo; (my good spirit, my better self). But like &ldquo;Mondnacht,&rdquo; &ldquo;Widmung&rdquo; 
takes an especially remarkable turn at its very end, and here there might be 
some mystery. </p>
<p>
[20] As Betsy and I now perform &ldquo;Widmung,&rdquo; perhaps I could ask you to give some 
attention to my analytic overlay in the score. You&rsquo;ll see that I make a claim 
for scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b>&mdash;the C-natural on the first &ldquo;Du&rdquo;&mdash;as primary tone (maybe C for 
Clara?). Natural scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> moves by implication to flat-<b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b>, the enharmonic 
B-natural, at the beginning of the <b>B</b>-section. And then, in one of Schumann&rsquo;s 
most breathtaking retransitions, the neighbor-tone <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> over the A-major chord in 
measure 25 becomes the <b>D-flat</b> of measure 26, while an unexpected descent via augmented-4th 
in the bass carries the harmony from the Neapolitan to the home dominant-7th. 
Within the four-bar &ldquo;standing-on-the-dominant-pedal&rdquo; phrase that follows, that 
stunning suspended grace-note in measure 27 seems to suggest that the pianist&rsquo;s voice 
nearly falters as she anticipates the singer&rsquo;s &ldquo;mein guter Geist.&rdquo; At the 
cadential close of the reprise in measures 38&ndash;39, you&rsquo;ll note that I have trouble 
finding a fundamental Urlinie descent on the musical surface! Finally, please 
ask yourself, Just what does the pianist&rsquo;s coda have to do with this song? And 
don&rsquo;t look ahead to my <b>Example 4</b>, because that will give everything away! (We 
<b>PERFORM</b> the song.)</p>

[21]
Well, you probably did look at Example 4, but if not, now&rsquo;s the time. Though 
I&rsquo;ve seen nothing in print about this, I know I&rsquo;m not the only person who hears 
Schumann alluding in his coda to the opening of Schubert&rsquo;s well-known &ldquo;Ave 
Maria.&rdquo; (<b>PLAY</b>). Why does Schumann do this?! The obvious first answer&mdash;Clara as 
virgin saint, the holy mother of God&mdash;may be the least interesting. Two 
additional ideas come to mind. First, it happens that, as a concert pianist in 
Berlin during the winter of 1839&ndash;1840, Clara frequently performed Franz Liszt&rsquo;s 
1838 transcription of Schubert&rsquo;s song, often on demand; we know this in 
particular from her letters to Robert.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Like the many other messages in music 
that Robert was in the habit of sending to Clara, his allusion to &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; 
might thus have been an especially private and professionally complimentary one. 
Second, there may have been another dedicat&eacute;e lurking behind the tones of 
Schumann&rsquo;s coda, and that would be Schubert himself&mdash;the composer whom Schumann 
loved the most, and to whom he may have been the most indebted. Don&rsquo;t forget 
that even at the end of Schumann&rsquo;s short life, just before his suicide attempt 
and his demand to be committed to an asylum, what brought him one glorious 
moment of happiness was the delusion that Schubert himself had appeared to him 
and given him a magnificent melody, for a set of variations.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[22]
As for the structural role of Schumann&rsquo;s coda, we might note that the 
twice-heard &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; melody, though technically just a turn around 
scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> (the A-flat), itself alludes to the middleground <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> 
descent at the end of the <b>A</b>-section in measures 12&ndash;13 (<b>PLAY</b>). We&rsquo;d have good reason 
to expect that a similar descent would provide the fundamental melodic closure 
of the song proper, but it&rsquo;s missing from the vocal line at measure 38, having been 
transferred to the pianist&rsquo;s tenor voice. Thus, whether or not Schumann&rsquo;s coda &ldquo;comes home&rdquo; to both Clara and Schubert, it does indeed subtly accomplish a 
melodic &ldquo;homecoming&rdquo;&mdash;one that, with much declamatory verve, the vocal line 
withholds. And yet, when we compare Schumann&rsquo;s harmonization of &ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; with 
Schubert&rsquo;s, we discover much greater dissonance with Schumann: note that the 
almost completely chromatic &ldquo;lament&rdquo;-like descent in the bass provides the 
opportunity for a new inversion of the half-diminished <b><nobr>ii<sup>7</sup></nobr></b>-chord heard at the 
word &ldquo;Schmerz&rdquo; in measures 5 and 33. R&uuml;ckert reminds us that there can be great pain 
in love; one senses that Schumann, just now on the verge of creating a home with 
Clara, had the prescience and wisdom to anticipate something of both the joy and 
the sorrow they would share.</p>
<p>
[23]
Here, then, is another closing moment in Schumann that retrospectively seems to 
encapsulate the expressive core of the piece, but it does this <i>as if</i> by standing 
outside the piece, for the purpose of reflecting upon it. We can come closer to 
capturing what happens here if we compare such closings with some of those great 
heroic struggles to victory, those progressive trajectories, those willful 
end-oriented works, often cyclic, that so many nineteenth-century composers 
(including Schumann) explored in the aftermath of Beethoven. By contrast, the 
closings and codas that I examine today are quiet, rather than climactic, 
affairs; the quietness is not atypical of codas in general, but not a 
requirement of these. The coda in &ldquo;Widmung&rdquo; is not set up to serve as the goal 
to which everything is directed, but it nevertheless seems to bring the song 
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; by virtue of both its structure and its deeply reflective, allusive 
character. </p>

[24]
A counter-example will be useful here, and I choose one more song&mdash;this one in 
the same key, A-flat major, but this one by Clara herself. Let&rsquo;s consider the 
ingenious but <i>entirely different</i> ending and overall shape that emerges in 
Clara&rsquo;s setting of Emanuel Geibel&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Die stille Lotosblume,&rdquo; shown with a 
text translation at <b>Example 5</b>. Upon Robert&rsquo;s encouragement, and now in the role 
of Clara Schumann, rather than Clara Wieck, she composed this song in 1842 and 
published it the following year, as the last of her Six Songs, Op. 13.</p>
<p>
[25]
One of Robert&rsquo;s own songs in his <i>Myrthen</i> collection is his setting of a poem by 
Heinrich Heine called, simply, &ldquo;Die Lotosblume&rdquo; (Op. 25, No. 7). From Heine as 
well as Geibel, we learn that the exotic, feminine-gendered lotus blossom 
prefers the moonlight to the morning sun; only at night does she rise up from 
the lake. Her delicate snow-white &ldquo;chalice&rdquo; suggests virginity, but the 
masculine-gendered moon knows how to make love to her. In Geibel&rsquo;s poem a third 
party enters the scene&mdash;a swan who yearns to rival the moon as suitor; it would 
appear that the swan knows how to communicate only through song. We don&rsquo;t know 
who raises the question at the end of Geibel&rsquo;s last stanza&mdash;&ldquo;Oh flower <nobr>. . .</nobr> can you 
understand the song?&rdquo;; does the swan finally speak here, or is this more likely 
a narrator? Either way, the lotus blossom emits no answer, and so the swan&rsquo;s 
song was probably in vain. To underscore the ambiguity, Clara reverses the <b>
V-to-I</b> harmonic path that Robert took in his &ldquo;Mondnacht,&rdquo; and the outcome is 
even bolder: Clara&rsquo;s song ends on the dominant-7th. </p>
<p>
[26]
To be more precise, Clara&rsquo;s ending is her beginning: you&rsquo;ll see that what 
returns in her final two bars is her initial 2-bar introduction, with its 
elegant appoggiatura-chord embellishment of the dominant-7th (<b>PLAY</b>). To be sure, 
the introduction serves as the upbeat to a genuine, unequivocal structural tonic 
in measure 3. But then both the antecedent phrase in measures 3&ndash;6 and the continuation in 
measures 7&ndash;10 lead to half cadences, and the second of these even specifically brings 
back the introductory progression. From this point forward, that progression 
will emerge as a kind of matrix, or referential source. Geibel&rsquo;s second stanza 
takes a repetition of the music for his first, such that a varied strophic form 
seems underway; but now the pianist&rsquo;s interlude at measures 18&ndash;21 extends the 
dominant-7th as goal, while introducing a new, double-neighbor figure that 
allows for pitch-specific returns of the introductory progression in diminution. 
The original antecedent phrase returns yet again at measures 22&ndash;25, but then a new 
model-sequence phrase (measures 26&ndash;29) carries us via descending step into the 
distant, inward realm of <b>flat-III</b> (C-flat major), the key for the swan&rsquo;s 
song. At this point the strophic form opens into something more comparable to 
the bar form&mdash;<b>A-A-B</b>, as in &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;: although an entire fourth stanza awaits its 
setting, you will hear, I think, that Geibel&rsquo;s third and fourth stanzas merge, 
for good textural reasons, to create just one expansive third part. While Betsy 
and I perform this one last song together, I invite you especially to note how 
pervasive the material of the pianist&rsquo;s interlude at measures 18ff now becomes from 
measure 30 onward. (We <b>PERFORM</b> the song.)</p>
<p>
[27]
To say the obvious, nothing could be more diametrically opposed to the notion of 
&ldquo;coming home&rdquo; in music than a piece that refuses to achieve tonal closure; but 
nothing could have been more appropriate in the context of Geibel&rsquo;s poem. Like 
the swan who circles round and round the flower, singing for all his life but 
getting nowhere, Clara&rsquo;s song ends by coming full circle, by floating back to 
where it began; there can be no homecoming here, no resolution, because the poem 
itself ends midstream: we&rsquo;ll never know whether the lotus blossom succumbs to 
the swan or remains indifferent to him. It&rsquo;s tempting to propose that Clara 
Schumann&rsquo;s ending is even more daring than her husband&rsquo;s at the end of the first 
song of his cycle <i>Dichterliebe</i>: whereas Robert&rsquo;s dominant-7th in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> minor is 
given a momentary, albeit false, sense of resolution at the beginning of his 
second song, in A major, Clara&rsquo;s &ldquo;Die stille Lotosblume&rdquo; is the very last of a 
group of six. But there is no indication that Clara thought of her Op. 13 
collection as a &ldquo;cycle&rdquo;&mdash;to be performed complete, with Song 6 as the last; 
moreover, historians have stressed that even those opuses by Robert which we&rsquo;ve 
come to think of as song cycles, or piano cycles, were hardly ever performed as 
such during his lifetime.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> On the other hand, unless a performance of &ldquo;Die stille 
Lotosblume&rdquo; were to be followed by <i>something</i>, preferably in A-flat major, its 
ending is unsettling.</p>
<p>
[28]
Clara&rsquo;s song demonstrates one of various ways in which the closing of a movement 
can avoid creating the effect of a homecoming. But let me remind you that in no 
way do I equate mere home-tonic cadential closure&mdash;a staple of the tonal 
repertoire&mdash;with &ldquo;coming home.&rdquo; On the contrary, for example, Robert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ave 
Maria&rdquo; moment serves as a postscript to his song&rsquo;s definitive cadence. Nor do &ldquo;homecomings&rdquo; require the formal setting of a coda. The arrival 
&ldquo;nach Haus&rdquo; in 
&ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; coincides with the act of closing, rather than with the coda that 
follows. On the matter of &ldquo;homecoming&rdquo; as closure or post-closure, the next 
piece I consider might be a genuine borderline case.</p>

<p>
[29]
I turn here to the very first piece by Robert Schumann that I studied as a young 
pianist&mdash;his <i>Arabeske</i> in C Major, Op. 18, from 1839. In fact my brother, who is 
here today, might just remember this piece as one of the many that often 
competed with Chicago White Sox games on the TV in our childhood living room. 
The closing passage of the <i>Arabeske</i> might also very well be the original source 
of my fascination over all these years with closings in Schumann that would seem 
to evoke longings to &ldquo;come home.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll find the passage in question at the end 
of <b>Example 6</b>; please note that Schumann marks this not as a &ldquo;Coda,&rdquo; but rather 
&ldquo;Zum Schluss.&rdquo; In his marvelous &ldquo;performer&rsquo;s analysis&rdquo; of the <i>Arabeske</i>, from 
1996, my friend Charles Fisk astutely reminds us that in translation &ldquo;Zum 
Schluss&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In Closing&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;suggests the idea of cadential articulation much more 
strongly than does the term &lsquo;coda&rsquo;&mdash;tail&rdquo;; in other words, &ldquo;Zum Schluss&rdquo; implies 
the process of moving towards closure, rather than reflecting upon a closure 
already achieved. Like me, Fisk hears this passage as one that brings 
resolution, particularly in the realm of register; he also holds that the 
passage &ldquo;still searches for something,&rdquo; that it even &ldquo;pleads&rdquo; to &ldquo;keep the music 
open.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> Let me amplify Fisk&rsquo;s views, while introducing a few of my own.</p>
<p>
[30]
First to the matter of register, as this relates to formal design. The <i>Arabeske</i> 
takes the form of a modest, five-part rondo&mdash;<b>A-B-A-C-A</b>; it is thus most likely 
the &ldquo;<i>Rondolette</i>&rdquo; Robert tells Clara he has composed, in a letter from Vienna 
during his six-month stay there in 1838&ndash;39.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> As shown in the score at the 
beginning of Example 6, the rondo refrain itself&mdash;the <b>A</b>-section&mdash;is cast as a 
small ternary. I&rsquo;ll propose that the refrain opens with a presentation-type 
phrase whose model-sequence design allows the theme to strive upward to the high 
G-natural at measure 8. As scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b>, this tone <i>in that register</i> becomes for me 
the primary tone of the movement; but you&rsquo;ll note that there is no Urlinie-like 
descent from it in the passage that follows. We might want to tease out a 
descent in the <i>lower</i> register over the span of the cadential phrase (measures 9&ndash;12) 
and its varied repetition (measures 13&ndash;16); but the retention of scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> at 
the cadence suggests that fundamental closure has not been achieved. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 
1&ndash;16).</p>
<p>
[31]
At measures 17&ndash;24, a short, wistful, contrasting-middle phrase twice explores the 
mediant, E minor (iii), but then twice moves with a ritardando to the tonicized 
dominant (<b>PLAY</b>). After this, the entire first part of the rondo refrain returns. 
And that is <i>exactly</i> what will happen with each subsequent appearance of the 
refrain&mdash;the complete passage at measures 1&ndash;40 will return unchanged. Word has it that 
Schumann often sat dreamily at the keyboard and played favorite passages of his 
music over and over again; it seems that he invites us to do precisely the same 
with his rondo theme. </p>
<p>
[32]
As Fisk observes, the first episode, the <b>Minore I</b> that begins at measure 41, opens by 
transforming the E-minor idea at measure 17 and then repeating it twice, &ldquo;each time 
more intensely, as if the music cannot get away from it.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> (<b>PLAY</b>) Let me add that 
the first part of <b>Minore I</b> quickly regains the primary tone G-natural, now as 
<b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> 
within E minor, and then provides a stepwise descent from it, in tenths with the 
bass; but the descent passes through <b>F</b>-<i>natural</i> rather than <b><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr></b>, and the goal of 
the descent is nothing more than the implied <b><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> </b>at the Phrygian half cadence in 
measure 48. Pretending to be a refrain within a smaller rondo-within-the-rondo, the 
opening phrase of <b>Minore I</b> returns twice; in fact the episode ends with that 
phrase, again arriving at the half cadence in E minor at measure 88. If the <b>Minore I</b> 
has introduced a &ldquo;conflicting stratum of experience&rdquo; relative to the more serene 
rondo refrain, then the <b>retransition</b> that follows attempts a reconciliation.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> But 
the effort seems arduous, and maybe even unsuccessful: everything about this 
passage&mdash;its constant fluctuations in tempo, its loose model-sequence design, its 
utterly unstable tonal plan, its unresolved dominant-7ths and <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chords&mdash;all 
this points precariously, at least for me, to a kind of futile groping towards 
an unclear goal. Indeed, as the ultimate harmonic link back to the rondo 
refrain, the Neapolitan at measures 102 appears <i>pianissimo</i> out of the blue; it is 
approached via tritone in the bass. When the refrain finally gets underway again 
at measure 105, there&rsquo;s the sense that a very dark cloud has lifted. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 
81&ndash;106.)</p>
<p>
[33]
Fisk hears a synthesis of rondo theme, first episode, and retransition within 
the <b>Minore II</b>, which begins at measure 144.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> Begging his pardon, I instead sense even 
greater conflict here. Now we have the first unaccompanied <i>forte</i> version of the 
rondo theme&rsquo;s initial upbeat gesture&mdash;the arabesque-like flourish of neighbor 
motive with grace-note. Its dotted rhythm now pervades this episode&rsquo;s 
accompaniment; what results is a gruff, defiant character, until here quite 
foreign to the movement. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 145&ndash;52). As you&rsquo;ve just heard, the first 
part of this episode begins and ends in the submediant, A minor, and then it 
takes a repetition. The second part (measures 153&ndash;160), also repeated, forcefully 
works its way through an ascending-5ths sequence to close in E minor (iii). The 
final part (measures 161&ndash;68) acts as a &ldquo;pseudo-reprise&rdquo;: it recapitulates the opening 
of the episode, but does so in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; key&mdash;E minor, rather than A minor. One 
advantage of the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; key is that it permits the primary tone G-natural to be 
regained at measure 163, after which a supported <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b> descent in E minor brings 
us to the authentic cadence in measure 167, with <b>E</b>-natural in the soprano. And then 
the rondo theme returns for the last time. But for the <i>first</i> time, the E-natural 
at the end of <b>Minore II</b> supplies the hitherto unstated tone that leads to the 
theme&rsquo;s F-natural in its fourth bar. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 161&ndash;72.) </p>
<p>
[34]
Finally, let&rsquo;s turn to &ldquo;Zum Schluss.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll immediately recognize that the 
slower-moving half-note rhythm of its soprano melody, reverberating in 
syncopation an octave below, refers back to that troubled retransition (at measures 
89&ndash;104). But here the tonal tension of that earlier passage is being resolved: 
like a typical coda, the &ldquo;Zum Schluss&rdquo; passage follows upon a final cadence in 
the home key, and there will be no further departures from that key. Remember, 
however, that the refrain&rsquo;s final cadence does not sufficiently complete an 
Urlinie descent from the high G-natural. In particular, a supported E-natural, 
scale-degree <b><span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span></b>, is nowhere to be heard, except by implication, and in the wrong 
register, at measure 208. Surely that factor explains in part what makes the 
appoggiatura motion <b>E-D</b> at the beginning of the &ldquo;Zum Schluss&rdquo; seem so &ldquo;right&rdquo; 
and yet so poignant. Perhaps <i>now</i> an Urlinie descent will be completed from the 
<b>E</b>; and thus maybe this passage, like the coda in the first movement of 
Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Waldstein&rdquo; Sonata, will be the type of coda that doesn&rsquo;t really 
stand outside the fundamental structure of the movement as a whole; in other 
words, maybe that&rsquo;s what &ldquo;Zum Schluss&rdquo; means here. </p>
<p>
[35]
Could it be that the <b>E-D</b> gesture, thrice repeated and each time expanded, with 
each of its tones taking dissonant support, pleads <i>not</i> to &ldquo;keep the music open,&rdquo; 
but rather to achieve a close&mdash;that is, to &ldquo;bring the music home&rdquo;? Listen 
especially to the extraordinary effect of release, and relief, when, finally&mdash;at 
measures 215&ndash;16&mdash;the <b>E-D</b> motive&mdash;augmented, no less&mdash;at least attains a half cadence! In 
the final phrase, the music does indeed find a C-natural at measure 219; but the 
submediant harmony here denies this tone a structural role, and instead, the 
melody moves back into the lower register. One last, heart-rending appoggiatura 
chord at measure 221 underscores a remarkable augmentation in the soprano of the 
rondo refrain&rsquo;s upbeat neighbor-note motive&mdash;<b>G-A-G</b>; and then the original motive 
itself returns to lift the soprano right back to its starting point, the 
E-natural. So much, then, for an Urlinie closure; here is a closing that remains 
melodically open. In his commentary about the plight of the main character in 
Ludwig Tieck&rsquo;s novel <i>Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen</i>, the literary critic Marshall 
Brown says: &ldquo;There <i>is</i> no return home in this world, there is only moving 
forward. And moving forward means moving away from home and childhood, away from 
idyllic, self-centered ease, and out into the complexities of the world.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> The 
&ldquo;Zum Schluss&rdquo; passage of the <i>Arabeske</i> seems to know this; it yearns to close, 
but in the end it finds the courage to point away from home and into the future. 
(<b>PLAY</b>: Zum Schluss.)</p>

[36]
An irony here is that the <i>Arabeske</i> has been regarded by some as verging in the 
direction of <i>Hausmusik</i>&mdash;music for performance in the home, rather than in the 
concert hall or the salon; one of the reasons I was playing the <i>Arabeske</i> at an 
early age is because it&rsquo;s not at all technically difficult. By 1839 Clara, ever 
shrewd (even at age 20) about what audiences wanted to hear her play, found 
herself begging Robert to write simpler, more accessible piano music&mdash;&ldquo;easily 
understandable, and something without titles <nobr>. . .</nobr> not too long and not too short.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> 
Anthony Newcomb has argued that around this time Robert himself came to 
recognize the need to change direction: the intensely subjective, often 
&ldquo;eccentric,&rdquo; technically demanding, sometimes harmonically &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; and 
rhythmically experimental piano works of his youthful 1830s just weren&rsquo;t 
selling, nor would even Clara risk trying to present them to an unprepared 
public.<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> It happens, however, that, among the works by Schumann that I list at 
<b>Figure 2</b>
as candidates for further investigation into closings that suggest &ldquo;coming home,&rdquo; two of these&mdash;the 
<i>Fantasie</i> in C Major, Op. 17, and the slightly 
later <i>Davidsb&uuml;ndlert&auml;nze</i>, Op. 6&mdash;exemplify the undeniably romantic style Robert 
eventually felt obliged to modify. In particular, there is no other piece by 
Robert Schumann that more consummately proceeds in a trajectory towards &ldquo;home&rdquo; 
than his <i>Fantasie</i>, Op. 17. Moreover, and as Berthold Hoeckner&rsquo;s claims, the 
<i>Fantasie</i> has &ldquo;enjoyed perhaps the richest reception of any romantic piano work, 
having become, in a sense, a monument to Romanticism. Interpretations of the 
first movement, especially, have drawn upon quintessential categories of 
romantic aesthetics: fragment, <i>Witz</i>, and arabesque.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> One of the many 
contributions Hoeckner&rsquo;s recent work on the <i>Fantasie</i> makes is his critical 
engagement with the views of an illustrious list of writers since the late 1980s 
who have addressed (or readdressed) this piece; these include John Daverio, 
Linda Roesner, Charles Rosen, Anthony Newcomb, and Nicholas Marston, whose 
Cambridge Music Handbook on the <i>Fantasie</i>, from 1992, is impressive. I think I 
can assume that most of you are fairly well acquainted both with Schumann&rsquo;s 
<i>Fantasie</i> and with the work of some one or more of those writers. But no other 
work by Schumann could serve so well today as a culminating, and final, example 
of my topic, and so I ask you to bear with me.</p>

As you probably know, Robert composed the first version of this work as a 
&ldquo;Sonata for Beethoven,&rdquo; in the hope that money from its sales could be 
contributed towards the monument of Beethoven that was to be erected in Bonn. 
But the inception of the work, in 1836, also coincided with the period of 
greatest estrangement between Robert and Clara; her father had insisted that she 
return all of Robert&rsquo;s letters and never see him again. Two years later, and now 
referring to the work as a &ldquo;fantasy,&rdquo; Robert tells Clara that its first 
movement, originally titled &ldquo;Ruins,&rdquo; is &ldquo;probably the most passionate thing I 
have ever written&mdash;a deep lament for you.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> Though there remain a few doubting 
Thomases,<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> most connoisseurs of the <i>Fantasie</i> have long agreed that the first 
movement is based upon a reference to the beginning of the last song from 
Beethoven&rsquo;s cycle <i>An die ferne Geliebte</i>, shown at <b>Example 7</b>. The text given here 
will remind you that this is the cycle in which the poet strives to surmount the 
spatial and temporal distance between himself and his beloved by singing songs 
of love and then asking her to sing them back to him; accordingly, the last song 
not only begins with a variant of the first song but then also cyclically 
recapitulates the first song, at the very point where the poet hopes that his 
beloved has begun to sing. Schumann&rsquo;s allusion to Beethoven&rsquo;s cycle creates the 
perfect union of professional goal and private aspiration: he pays tribute to 
Beethoven by quoting him, but at the same time he has Beethoven&rsquo;s distant 
beloved secretly refer to Clara, to whom he sends all his love and sorrow 
through his music.<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup></p>

Hoeckner goes further than anyone to date in tracing fragments of both the first 
and the last of Beethoven&rsquo;s songs within Schumann&rsquo;s first movement. Under the 
constraints of time today, I&rsquo;ll focus <i>only</i> on the two most well-known ideas that 
Schumann appropriates, the ones labeled <b>a</b> and<b> b</b> in the score at Example 7. 
You&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;ve reversed <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> here, because that&rsquo;s what Schumann will 
do. In <b>a</b>, note especially the motion through the interval of a 5th to and from

The large-scale form of the <i>Fantasie</i>&rsquo;s first movement has been endlessly 
debated; but I think we might agree that a sonata-like Transition begins at measure 
29 and leads to the first stage of a two-part, modulating secondary theme (<b>ST</b>), 
whose initial key&mdash;D minor&mdash;perhaps refers back to that gorgeous <b>ii</b>-chord over 
dominant pedal at the movement&rsquo;s opening. Certainly the key of D minor helps to 
sustain focus upon the A-natural with which the main theme (<b>MT</b>) began, now even 
giving it consonant support. Please note the transformed return of both the <b>a</b>- 
and the <b>b</b>-idea; then the entire <b>ST</b> takes a restatement in, of all the 
&ldquo;nonclassical&rdquo; ST-keys, the subdominant, F major, beginning at measure 61. First 
comes a newly interpreted version of <b>a</b>, then <b>b</b>, as follows. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 60&ndash;81 ) </p>
<p>
[40]
By far the most remote, even disguised, version of the <b>b</b>-idea interrupts the 
narrative of the famous <i>Im Legendenton</i> passage, not shown here&mdash;the central 
passage that has thwarted sonata-form interpretations of the movement. After 
that passage, a recapitulation of sorts begins with the Transition materials 
from the exposition, and now the two-fold <b>ST</b> returns transposed <i>down a step</i>: 
that is, it begins in the home tonic minor and then moves into E-flat 
major&mdash;Beethoven&rsquo;s original home key in <i>An die ferne Geliebte</i>. For those on the 
inside track, the fundamental direction of the movement now begins to emerge. 
Everything is leading inexorably to a revelation at the very end: the Adagio at 
<b>measure 295</b> quotes the <b>b</b>-idea in its clearest, most Beethoven-like form, and in doing 
this, it closes the movement with the first and <i>only</i> authentic cadence in C 
major. Charles Rosen puts it best: Schumann doesn&rsquo;t just allude to Beethoven&rsquo;s 
ideas, he <i>absorbs</i> these, to the point where it sounds as if he had composed them 
himself. The allusion to Beethoven within the Adagio &ldquo;appears not as a 
reminiscence of another composer, but as at once the source and the solution of 
everything in the music&mdash;up to that final page <nobr>. . .</nobr> the entire movement <nobr>. . .</nobr> is a 
preparation for, and development of, the concluding phrase,&rdquo; &ldquo;which serves as 
the point of rest and the center of gravity.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> In short, here is Schumann&rsquo;s most 
complex, most elaborate &ldquo;homecoming,&rdquo; second <i>only</i> to the one he will achieve at 
the end of his <i>Fantasie</i> as a whole. (<b>PLAY</b>: measures 274&ndash;309.)</p>

Schumann originally planned to recapitulate the end of his first movement at the 
end of his last movement, but he changed his mind. Rosen insists on the 
effectiveness of Schumann&rsquo;s original plan and performs the last movement 
accordingly. I vote on Schumann&rsquo;s ultimate ending, shown at <b>Example 9b</b>. No 
blatant cyclicism here; instead something much more moving&mdash;for its subtlety, and 
because now the music celebrates a homecoming over the distant span of the 
complete three-movement work. A circle within a circle is closed here: the 
texture and harmonic progression beginning at measure 130 bring us back to the 
beginning of the movement (see <b>Example 9a</b>, and the pervasive neighbor motion G-A-G 
clearly remembers the opening of the first movement. It even regains the 
register of that initial A-natural, whose appearances in so many different 
contexts throughout the piece suggest to me that this tone is the technical 
representative of the secret &ldquo;leiser Ton&rdquo; from Friedrich Schlegel&rsquo;s motto at the 
top of the first movement&rsquo;s score. The end of the <i>Fantasie</i> may just be one of 
the great musical homecomings of all time. (<b>PLAY</b>: end of last movement.)</p>
<p>

In an article bent on comparing the healthy, successful career of Felix 
Mendelssohn with the troubled one of Robert Schumann, Michael P. Steinberg 
portrays Schumann as &ldquo;spiritually homeless&rdquo;; Schumann&rsquo;s concern for &ldquo;bourgeois 
identity and respectability, <nobr>. . .</nobr> masculine propriety and control,&rdquo; all part of an 
inward-directed North German cultural identity, prevented him from sustaining a 
consistent compositional &ldquo;voice&rdquo; of his own. Such piano works as the &ldquo;esoteric&rdquo;
<i>Fantasie</i> are for Steinberg &ldquo;the site of the private, the secret, the <i>heimlich</i>, 
and thereby also of the <i>unheimlich</i>, or uncanny and terrifying.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> Yes, Schumann&rsquo;s 
music knows terror, and for good reason: from his late teens onward, he lived in 
the terror of going mad one day. And, yes, music like the <i>Fantasie</i> is wildly 
esoteric. One of the really gripping details about Schumann is that the music we 
pianists in particular regard as some of his greatest ever written was later 
dismissed by him as &ldquo;immature and unfinished&rdquo;: in 1843 he says, &ldquo;the man and the 
musician in me were always trying to express themselves simultaneously; no doubt 
that remains so, although I have learned to control myself and also my art 
better.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> Steinberg notwithstanding, I&rsquo;ll propose that the closing moments of no 
other composer know better how to convey a longing for home, and sometimes its 
imaginative attainment, even if, as Gyorgy Lukacs has said, &ldquo;longing has never 
had a home.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> And so, I am very grateful for the chance to come home to Schumann 
today.</p>
