<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section1"><b>1. Introduction</b></a></p>

<p>[1.1] Theory and analysis have known a fast development in Continental
Europe during the last twenty years. Yet, for many reasons, the
situation here remains quite different from what it is in English
speaking countries. After the Third European Congress for Music
Analysis in Montpellier in 1995, Jonathan Cross commented on this
situation in the Bulletin of the SMA (the British Society for Music
Analysis) for May 1995. His comments led the organizers of the
forthcoming Fourth European Congress (see below) to devote one of its
sessions to discussing European traditions and usages. The present
note stems from my own reflection in this context&mdash;and I claim sole
responsibility for what follows. I will begin with considerations of
the recent history of analysis and musicology, before turning to more
fundamental matters.</p>

<p>[1.2] The recent development of analytical studies in Continental Europe
owes much to the personality of Celestin Deliege, who founded the
class of analysis in the Royal Conservatoire in Liege (Belgium). He
was the first to seriously report on Schenkerian analysis in his
 <i>Fondements de la musique tonale</i> (Paris, 1984). Deliege is fully
aware of the dramatic change that Schenkerian analysis was bound to
mean for the discipline. He rightly claimed that theory should become
descriptive rather than prescriptive, insisting at the same time that,
beyond the level of mere description, analysis should reach to the
inner structure of the work. But Deliege also claimed the need to
transcend orthodox Schenkerism and advocated a &ldquo;post-schenkerian&rdquo;
analysis influenced, among others, by Lerdahl and Jackendoff.
</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section2"><b>2. European Societies and the European Congresses 
for Music Analysis </a></p></b>

<p>[2.1] Another important figure in the development of a modern analytical
activity in France and Europe is Pierre-Marie Sgard, the founder of
the French Societe d&rsquo;Analyse Musicale. The story is unusual because
Sgard is not a musician, but a financial analyst, and he wanted the
Societe d&rsquo;Analyse Musicale to be organized like the one for financial
analysis in which he was active. The project sounded odd to many of
us, but it certainly pushed us in directions which we may not have
taken otherwise and which proved fruitful. Sgard foresaw the building
up of a European network of Societies for Music Analysis and, to this
aim, called the First European Congress for Music Analysis in Colmar
(France) in 1989. He intended it to be reserved to formally
constituted societies for music analysis, and his call indeed was
instrumental in the creation of such societies in Great Britain,
Belgium, Italy and Spain. The French Society since considered it its
duty to foster the creation of societies and has been active to this
effect in Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. The idea of a
Federation of Societies has been in the air since Colmar, although
with limited consequence up to now. The present reflection on European
traditions and usages aims among others at an inventory of our
differences, in the hope to promote further exchanges.</p>

<p>
[2.2] It was decided in Colmar that a European congress should be called
every two years, a program to which we have almost been able to
hold. The second Congress was held in Trento (Italy) in 1991, with a
wider international participation than in Colmar, especially from
Eastern European countries where we met with yet other musicological
traditions with which we will have to cope in the future. The French
invited the Third Congress in Montpellier in 1995, and the Fourth one
is foreseen in Corfu (Greece) at Easter 1998. Its motto, &ldquo;Towards an
analytical musicology,&rdquo; is intended to stress a European will to
develop analysis within the science of music at large, rather than as
an autonomous approach opposed to the historical one. We want the term
&ldquo;musicology&rdquo; (and the discipline itself) to remain as comprehensive as
possible, as is its German counterpart, <i>Musikwissenschaft</i>.</p>

<hr>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section3"><b>3. Journals</b></a></p>

<p>[3.1] Pierre-Marie Sgard also was the founder, in 1985, of the quarterly
journal <i>Analyse musicale</i>, which soon became the main scientific
journal on music in French. The story ended rather sadly, because
Sgard&rsquo;s purposes eventually proved incompatible with the usages of the
musical and musicological community, but the journal had produced 32
issues by 1993, with quite a few important contributions. It helped
(re-)creating redactional habits among musicologists and musicians who
for too long had been faced with a starving editorial activity. After
<i>Analyse musicale</i> ceased its activity, its editorial board decided
the creation of a new journal with similar aims, <i>Musurgia</i> (the name
<i>Analyse musicale</i> being unavailable). After slow beginnings, the
journal seems to have found its rhythm; it will publish its 11th issue
in July 1997.</p>

<p>[3.2] In Belgium, I created in 1988 a little quarterly journal,
<i>Fascicules d&rsquo;Analyse Musicale</i>, with the aim of helping students and
young musicians trying themselves to writing and publishing. Although
cheaply produced and inexpensive, it too proved able to publish
interesting contributions. The production (entirely hand made, from
the photocopying to the mailing) was time consuming, however, and I
was compelled to stop in 1991 after 16 issues.</p>

<p>[3.3] Other journals in French do exist, of course, but none as
specifically devoted to theory and analysis as <i>Musurgia</i>. Several
short-lived journals have been devoted to contemporary music. One
notable exception is <i>Les Cahiers du CIREM</i> (Centre International de
Recherches en Esthetique Musicale), still alive and well after some
twelve years.</p>

<hr>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>4. Music Education 
</b></a></p>


<p>[4.1] The situation of musical analysis in Continental Europe must be
understood in consideration of the situation of musical education. I
refer more specifically to the existence of two educational regimes,
the Conservatory and the University. This situation seems to prevail
throughout most of Continental Europe. Performing musicians learn
their skills in a Conservatory, while music teachers and researchers
(we tend to call them &ldquo;musicologists,&rdquo; independently of whether they
work on historical or theoretical matters) normally choose a
University. Even if Conservatories today tend to develop curricula in
theory and even if Universities expect from their students a good
practice of music, the approaches to the discipline are
different. From an administrative point of view also, in France and in
Belgium, the two types of institutions are quite distant from each
other : the Conservatories depend from the Ministry of Culture, the
Universities from that of Education. All this results in some tension,
although in France at least the situation is improving. Several
students are following classes in both institutions.</p>

<p>[4.2] In Conservatories, theory formerly was considered an unavoidable
nuisance, especially by the instrument teachers who had rather seen
their students practice scales all day long. Things are now changing
very fast. The Paris Conservatoire National, especially, developed a
full curriculum of theory (I am less aware of the situation in the
other French Conservatoire National, in Lyons). Much of the teaching,
however, remains based on a relation Master/Disciple which belongs to
a venerable tradition. This must have been very much the situation in
Olivier Messiaen&rsquo;s class of analysis, the model of which was taken
over by several of his students. It is not necessarily unsatisfactory
in itself, but it often results in a lack of critical attitude with
respect to methodology. The teacher proposes his own method (not
necessarily a bad one), but subjects it neither to evaluation, nor to
comparisons. As a result, in some classes of analysis, the major
theoretical traditions (e.g. Riemann or Schenker) are never discussed
and probably remain unknown. Analysis often reduces to an exercise in
musical description (a &ldquo;guided tour&rdquo; of the work; see Leopold Mannes&rsquo;s
Introduction to Felix Salzer&rsquo;s <i>Structural Hearing</i>). Classes of
analysis in the conservatories, it is true, busy themselves mainly
with modern and contemporary music which, from a methodological point
of view, cannot be treated in the same way as tonal music.</p>

<p>[4.3] The music curriculum in French universities is rather recent :
while classes in music history existed before, the first departments
of music appeared only after the Parisian events of 1968. The interest
for theory and analysis has been real from the beginnings, due mainly
to the personality of Jacques Chailley, and of Serge Gut who followed
him in the Sorbonne, but many of the other teachers had been formed as
historians, so that theoretical and analytical studies were slow to
develop. Chailley and Gut (and others) have been influential, though,
and the situation appears now to be reversing, the younger generation
showing a growing interest for these matters. The approach often is
methodological&mdash;musicians formed in the conservatories complain, at
times rightly, that universitarians are more preoccupied with
justifying their methods than with performing analyses. Another
important point, however, is that French musicologists always have had
a strong historical formation, and none of us today is ready to accept
a music theory that would be divorced from history. The curriculum
also includes classes on the history of theory. For the analysis of
tonal music, in universities as in the conservatories, the prevailing
method is primarily based on roman numeral harmonic analysis. MTO
readers who know Wason&rsquo;s book (<i>Viennese Harmonic Theory from
Albrechtsberger to Schenker and Schoenberg</i>, UMI, 1985) will be aware
that this method is of Viennese origin. It does not correspond to the
French 19th-century tradition and it is unclear to me, at this point,
how it came to influence France and Belgium. In late 19th and early
20th century, at any rate, Vincent d&rsquo;Indy and Francois-Auguste Gevaert
had tried, with limited success, to introduce in France and Belgium
the Riemannian functional analysis which remains at the basis of the
education to theory in German speaking and in several Eastern
countries.</p>
<hr>


<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>5. The Reception of Schenker</b></a></p>

<p>[5.1] The history of the reception of Schenkerian theory in France and
Belgium is characteristic. As mentioned above, Celestin Deliege was
the first to really draw attention to Schenker (earlier attempts
having been rather deficient). His <i>Fondements de la musique tonale</i>
(1984) is a complex work, too difficult perhaps to have been really
influential, but it certainly shook up many of us. Although French
students are not very good at foreign languages (and Schenker himself,
of course, is no easy reading), several Master degrees and Doctoral
dissertations devoted to Schenkerian analysis have been written in the
late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s, among others under the direction of Serge
Gut (I stress this in tribute to his openness of mind). I published my
French translation of <i>Der freie Satz</i> (<i>Free Composition</i>) in 
1993,
and Schenker analysis is taught since in several French universities.</p>

<p>[5.2] The resistance against Schenker remains strong, however. Serge
Gut, for instance, published in the last issue of the <i>Revue de
Musicologie</i>very good reviews of my Schenker translation and of my
<i>Heinrich Schenker: Une introduction</i>, but he accompanied them with
an article on what he dubbed &ldquo;Schenkeromania,&rdquo; in which he complains
against some real or supposed excesses of Schenker&rsquo;s theories. Gut has
the advantage over several of his French colleagues to be fluent in
German. He is a very good knower and an active advocate of Riemann&rsquo;s
theories and he has a first hand knowledge of Schenker. One reason of
his criticism is a common misunderstanding of Schenker&rsquo;s purpose, a
failure to realize that Schenker&rsquo;s analyses are not always
inductive. (Gut argues against the fact that Schenker, in his analysis
of BWV 940 in <i>Das Meisterwerk</i> I,99, deduces a fundamental line that
is a diatonic, Aeolian minor scale, while the piece, Gut claims, really
is in harmonic or melodic minor. In this, Gut is right, of course, but
he fails to understand Schenker&rsquo;s point which, in this case, is more
theoretical than analytic in the modern sense.) But Gut&rsquo;s criticism also
results, I believe, from a rejection of an agressiveness of Schenkerian
theories (especially, I am sorry to have to say, in some of their
American formulations): adopting an eclectic point of view that I
think characteristic of our universities, and in view of his own
commitment to Riemann&rsquo;s theories, Gut cannot admit that Schenkerian
analysis should be adopted <i>instead</i> of other theories&mdash;and I fully
agree with him on this point.</p>

<p>[5.3] Jacques Chailley evidences an even stronger rejection of
Schenker&rsquo;s theories. A disciple of Maurice Emmanuel, he has busied
himself with a lasting reflection on a &ldquo;musical philology,&rdquo; the inner
functioning of the musical language. He developed an evolutionary
theory according to which the recognition of intervals as consonances
followed the order of the harmonics : the fifth in the middle ages,
the thirds in the Renaissance, the dominant seventh in the Baroque,
etc. More important for the present discussion, he published in 1951 a
 <i>Traite historique d&rsquo;analyse musicale</i> (2nd edition as <i>Traite
historique d&rsquo;analyse harmonique</i>, 1977), several principles of which
(e.g. concerning analysis by reduction, or harmonic degrees) were
similar to some expressed by Schenker. Schenker was unknown by then:
none of his writings had been translated in any language by 1951; even
the 2nd German edition of <i>Der freie Satz</i> did not exist. When
Schenkerian theory began to be proposed in France, Chailley rightly
resented that ideas that he had advocated since such a long time now
came to be presented as novel.</p>

<p>[5.4] The rejection of Schenker is mainly due to a distrust for
anything resembling totalitarian orthodoxy. (It may be worth noting
that Forte&rsquo;s set theory, which we viewed as another orthodoxy, met
with a similar suspicion in Colmar in 1989. The dispute has left
interesting traces in <i>Analyse musicale</i>.) And even although my own
presentation of Schenkerian theories to the French readership has been
rather orthodox (or so I believe), I myself would be quite opposed to
any formalized Schenkerian orthodoxy, which I would consider utterly
foreign to his own ideas. As mentioned above, Schenkerian analysis now
is taught in several universities, both in France and in Belgium, but
it is always confronted to other approaches. For sure, we will not
form a generation of Schenkerians as in the United States. I trust
that my colleagues, like myself, teach a critical reading of Schenker,
and I believe that a different, more contrasted image of Schenker
might develop here in Europe.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section6"><b>6. Semiology</b></a></p>

<p>
[6.1] In his report on the Montpellier Congress to which I alluded at
the outset, Jonathan Cross writes: &ldquo;Just as Americans seem to burst
into life at the mere mention of their favorite pitch class sets
[<nobr> . . . </nobr>], so French hearts beat collectively faster at the very thought
of <i>le niveau neutre</i>.&rdquo; The tripartition theory of Jean Molino and
Jean-Jacques Nattiez indeed has been with us since its initial
presentation in Nattiez&rsquo; <i>Fondements d&rsquo;une semiologie de la musique</i>
and in Molino&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fait musical et semiologie de la musique&rdquo; (in
<i>Musique en jeu</i> 17), both in 1975. To those less familiar with the
theory, I remind that Molino rightly claimed that, rather than
wondering about the meaning of music, one should consider the three
stages of its existence, production (&ldquo;poiesis&rdquo;), reception
(&ldquo;esthesis&rdquo;) with the &ldquo;neutral level&rdquo; (the work&mdash;whatever that is) in
between. The claim obviously is in favor of a semiology of
communication against one of signification. The history of semiology
as a whole is an oscillation between these two tendencies. As to the
tripartition theory itself, its ubiquity merely results from its
evidence, which I think confines to triviality.</p>

<p>[6.2] My purpose here is not to discuss Molino&rsquo;s tripartition, however,
but to acknowledge that semiology has been present in European
musicological thinking ever since 1975. Eero Tarasti&rsquo;s research
project on Musical Signification extended the reflection far beyond
the European borders, but his group includes a post-Greimasian
tendency which, I believe, remains quite typically French, in
inspiration at least. Greimas attempted a description of a &ldquo;structural
semantics,&rdquo; a formalized semantics that would be based on an inner
logic rather than on a relation to the outer world. The idea of a
non-referential semantics must be appealing to musicians, of course,
and Greimas&rsquo;s &ldquo;semiotic square&rdquo; has been taken by some as a guide for
the analysis of music.</p>

<p>
[6.3] Closer to the structuralist tradition, a seminary held at the
University of Paris Sorbonne under the title <i>Musique et style</i>, in
collaboration between the Department of Music and that of French
language, has been discussing music among others from a semiotic point
of view for three years now. Two volumes of the acts have been
published and a third one is in preparation. And this is but one among
several activities in this field in France.

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section7"><b>7. Conclusion</b></a></p>

<p>[7.1] Jonathan Cross wrote (ibid.) that &ldquo;nearly all the major
developments in theory and analysis since the Second World War have
come from the USA.&rdquo; This, in a way, probably is true, but perhaps only
partly so. Certainly, important theoretical and analytical traditions
have developed in Europe, which should not be overwhelmed by the
American industry. The main case in point is Riemann&rsquo;s theory, which
has known important developments and modernizations after his death in
1919 but which remains actively ignored in the English speaking
countries (e.g. in the <i>New Grove</i>)&mdash;and, to say the truth, in
France as well. Carl Dahlhaus, or Jacques Chailley, are first rank
theoreticians and they are not the only ones.</p>

<p>[7.2] If the matter is considered from a higher point of view, however,
what strikes me most is the lack of exchange between our traditions,
both within Europe itself and between Europe and the other parts of
the world. I have seen foreign students led to complete
misunderstanding in Paris merely because their theoretical
presuppositions were different from those of their teacher, without
that any of them realized the problem. Despite such important means as
RISM or, today, the Internet, I am not sure that the French literature
on theory and analysis is known abroad, and I know by personal
experience that the literature in English, German, Italian and
Spanish, to mention only a few languages, is almost completely ignored
in France. (Belgium is better in this respect as the country,
miniature as it is, has three official languages.) If the present note
can help bringing some change to this situation, it will have
fulfilled its purpose.</p>
