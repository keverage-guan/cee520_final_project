<h3><a name="pt1"></a>The Janus-faced Sibelius</h3>
<p>[1] As discussed in the Preface of <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> the reception of 
  Jean Sibelius&rsquo;s music has been marked by a curious dichotomy. By and large, 
  musicians, the musical public (with certain geographical limitations), and the 
  recording industry have enthusiastically promoted its cause, while &ldquo;academics 
  outside Finland have taken Sibelius seriously only recently&rdquo; (xv). The most 
  famous or infamous epitome of the &ldquo;academical&rdquo; scorn for Sibelius, Theodor Adorno&rsquo;s 
  &ldquo;Glosse &uuml;ber Sibelius,&rdquo; is quoted once again in the Preface. And certainly, 
  in view of his formidable intellectual influence, a reference to Adorno at the 
  outset of a Sibelius book is still in order as an aid to identifying those aspects 
  of Sibelius&rsquo;s music that have led to the &ldquo;academic&rdquo; prejudices against it&mdash;even 
  if the level of musical penetration in a casual attack such as &ldquo;Glosse&rdquo; is hardly 
  adequate for meriting a lasting influence.</p>
<p>[2] The present anthology testifies to a change of attitudes among &ldquo;academics.&rdquo; 
  Of its twelve contributors, seven are North Americans and Britons whereas five 
  are Finns. The essays treat Sibelius&rsquo;s music from widely variable angles, but, 
  significantly, the majority of them make use of modern analytical techniques, 
  being thus willing to address Adorno&rsquo;s charge of the inadequate &ldquo;state of musical 
  material&rdquo; directly by the close examination of that material. Schenkerian-oriented 
  approaches are well represented. This is quite appropriate since an important 
  aspect of Sibelius&rsquo;s art is his relationship with the past, his position as 
  one of the last representatives of the great tonal tradition. Moreover, whereas 
  the surface of Sibelius&rsquo;s music made the impression of &ldquo;senseless juxtaposition&rdquo; 
  in Adorno, Schenkerian reductions&mdash;if competently performed&mdash;are able 
  to offer demonstration of precisely those &ldquo;standards of musical quality&rdquo; that 
  Adorno cherished, &ldquo;the richness of inter-connectedness&rdquo; and &ldquo;unity in diversity,&rdquo; 
  as being amply present beneath the sometimes fragmentary surface (xviii&ndash;xix). 
  But the ability to exploit the large-scale potential of the tonal system is 
  only one facet of Sibelius&rsquo;s accomplishment. Whereas Adorno charged Sibelius 
  both with the defective command of traditional techniques and with the failure 
  to keep in touch with later advances, both charges may be contested by analytical 
  examination. With reason the editors speak of a &ldquo;combination of progressive 
  and conservative aspects&rdquo; in Sibelius&rsquo;s &ldquo;Janus-faced&rdquo; music (xv); the advanced 
  &ldquo;state of musical material&rdquo; is also evident in aspects reflecting contemporary 
  modernistic trends and even pointing to the future. In this review, I concentrate 
  on the analytical and theoretical perspectives brought up in <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> 
  treating first the essays involving Schenkerian methods and proceeding then 
  to discuss the more &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; aspects in Sibelius&rsquo;s music and their treatment 
  in the present anthology.</p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="pt2"></a>Jackson&rsquo;s Enterprise: Bold Promises&mdash;Shaky Groundwork</h3>
<p>[3] Since the largest space by far in the collection&mdash;100 pages, more than 
  twice the size of the second largest paper&mdash;has been allotted to a contribution 
  by one of the editors, Timothy L. Jackson, it is appropriate to begin by commenting 
  on his essay, &ldquo;Observations on crystallization and entropy in the music of Sibelius 
  and other composers.&rdquo; In conformance with its size, the scope of the analytical 
  perspectives brought up in this article is impressive. Instead of merely presenting 
  voice-leading reductions of individual movements, Jackson addresses such broader 
  topics as inter-movement organization, historical evolution within a compositional 
  genre, and the relationship between musical organization and extra-musical or 
  programmatic significance&mdash;important issues Schenkerians are sometimes charged 
  with neglecting. To illuminate such broad perspectives, Jackson presents analytical 
  graphs of over twenty compositions by various composers&mdash;less than half by Sibelius. 
  The present essay may be viewed as a part of a larger project; some of its material 
  has been presented in Jackson&rsquo;s previous publications.</p>
<p>[4] Jackson writes grippingly and colorfully, making conclusions that seem 
  exciting and, for the most part, logically supported by the analytical graphs. 
  Indeed, at first sight one may get the impression of Jackson&rsquo;s enterprise as 
  one of the most interesting in the field of analytical research. However, the 
  first and most crucial requirement for any kind of analytical conclusion is 
  that the relationship between the basic analytical entities, such as voice-leading 
  graphs, and the actual compositions be cogent and meaningful. It is with this 
  issue that Jackson&rsquo;s article has its greatest problems, problems whose quantity 
  and gravity seriously detract from the cogency of his project. While his terminology 
  is conventionally Schenkerian, Jackson&rsquo;s readings are frequently in blatant 
  contradiction with any normal analytical criteria based on the well-established 
  principles of tonal syntax. Characteristically, moreover, he does little to 
  explicate the grounds even for his most peculiar-looking interpretations, and 
  the reader&rsquo;s efforts to trace implicit grounds yield no consistent result. </p>
<p>[5] A central notion in Jackson&rsquo;s essay is that of <i>auxiliary cadence.</i> 
  Of special significance is the &ldquo;over-arching&rdquo; type of auxiliary cadence, in 
  which the &ldquo;definitive tonic arrival&rdquo; or &ldquo;DTA&rdquo; only occurs towards the end of 
  a movement or composition (177, 187&ndash;8). The auxiliary cadence serves as 
  a metaphor of <i>crystallization</i> (189)&mdash;a concept with evident programmatic 
  potential. As a special theoretical innovation Jackson sets forth the concept 
  of <i>&ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence</i> (188&ndash;9). This notion (the apparent 
  contradiction in which Jackson readily acknowledges) refers to a situation in 
  which an initial firm root-position tonic is &ldquo;devalued and subsumed&mdash;in 
  light of subsequent events&mdash;within the &lsquo;p&rsquo; [pre-cadential chord] of an auxiliary 
  cadence&rdquo; to some other scale degree (189). This other scale degree may then 
  function in another auxiliary cadence directed towards the &ldquo;DTA,&rdquo; occurring 
  later in the work.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[6] The temporal perspectives evoked by the notion of &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence 
  are certainly interesting. There is no denying that a significant part of our 
  musical experience is the sense in which the impressions of structural relationships 
  change over the course of musical time. And by no means is the opening harmony 
  devoid of the possibility of being retrospectively reinterpreted or &ldquo;devalued&rdquo;&mdash;even 
  if it eventually turns out to be the same chord as the functional tonic. <b>Example 1</b> illustrates. 
  Consider the abstract bass lines in its top stave and possible impressions at 
  time-points (1), (2), and (3). Even if the initial C makes the impression of 
  being the tonic at time-point (1), under certain circumstances we may experience 
  it as subordinate to another scale degree (IV or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>VI) at time-point (2). Moreover, 
  even if we understand C as the tonic once again at time-point (3), it is not 
  implausible that there might be circumstances that support no connection between 
  the first and the second C. Under such circumstances, there would be justification 
  for preferring the readings in Example 1b, in which a &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence 
  is linked with a structurally superior auxiliary cadence, to the more commonplace 
  readings in Example 1a.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>[7] Despite the interest of such temporal perspectives, one should not lose 
  sight of the fact that the readings in Example 1b do require special circumstances. 
  In what is probably a great majority of cases, occurrences of the bass lines 
  in question give little support for perceiving the harmony at (2)&mdash;even 
  momentarily&mdash;as the tonic or structurally superior in relation to (1). If 
  the notion of &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence is to have any descriptive power, it 
  cannot be applied indiscriminately to all instances of such bass lines. This 
  point may appear self-evident, but making it seems necessary since Jackson&rsquo;s 
  examples do so little to clarify what kind of conditions he actually posits 
  for the occurrence of a &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[8] <b>Example 2</b> 
  reproduces relevant parts of Jackson&rsquo;s first exemplar of this notion, the finale 
  of Beethoven&rsquo;s 7th Symphony (his Example 8.6). The graph appears ambiguous as regards 
  the relative priority of the A in measure 12 and the F in measure 198 (an ambiguity perhaps 
  intended to reflect shifting temporal perspectives).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
  Verbally, however, Jackson asserts clearly that &ldquo;the tonic [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] is reinterpreted 
  as the &lsquo;upper third&rsquo; of F, more specifically as the mediant in a III<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3-V-I 
  (A-C-F) auxiliary cadence in the key of the flat submediant, F major&rdquo; 
  (201); hence, the reading is similar to Example 1b:ii. The A-C-F progression 
  is repeated in measures 231&ndash;321 and the &ldquo;definitive tonic&rdquo; only arrives in measure 
  451.</p>
<p>[9] In his discussion of the &lsquo;tonic&rsquo; auxiliary cadence, Jackson explains that 
  the identification of this phenomenon &ldquo;depends entirely upon context&rdquo; and offers 
  two clues suggesting that an opening tonic is not &ldquo;DTA&rdquo; (200). The first of 
  these is &ldquo;provided by design if its main thematic material is deferred.&rdquo; The 
  second is the occurrence of the tonic &ldquo;in the wrong mode, minor instead of major 
  or vice versa.&rdquo; Leaving aside for the moment considerations of the validity 
  of these clues in tracing prolongational relationships, it may be observed that 
  his first exemplar is supported by neither clue. The tonic is, of course, major 
  right from the start (measure 12), and it is also difficult to see how the thematic 
  design would speak for measure 451 as the &ldquo;definitive tonic arrival&rdquo; or &ldquo;crystallization.&rdquo; 
  Jackson calls attention to the &ldquo;tremendous weight on the dominant at the beginning 
  of the primary theme (measures 1&ndash;12), while the tonic resolution in measure 12 is 
  relatively &lsquo;weakened,&rsquo; almost perfunctory&rdquo; (201). He fails to mention, however, 
  that the prevalence of the A major tonic continues in a straightforward manner 
  in measures 20&ndash;40, supporting material whose &ldquo;definitiveness&rdquo; hardly falls behind 
  that of his &ldquo;DTA&rdquo; in measure 451. In fact, the material in 451 ff. repeats that in 
  measures 36 ff.</p>
<p>[10] If the A major tonic in measure 12 and measure 20 ff. seems powerful and straightforward 
  enough to strongly suggest (to say the least) a &ldquo;definitive arrival,&rdquo; an even 
  more puzzling aspect in Jackson&rsquo;s analysis is the notion of the F in measure 198 
  as the goal tonic in an A-C-F cadence. One would imagine that overriding 
  the A as a tonic would presuppose rather extreme means to direct the tonal focus 
  toward F. In the Beethoven, however, one finds no elements whatsoever to suggest 
  a tonicization of F major at its appearance or in the events leading to it (whereas 
  the preceding C is amply tonicized). Moreover, aspects such as orchestration 
  and dynamics clarify the character of F as a surprise digression from the main 
  progression C-E; the F supports a pianissimo woodwind episode (measures 198&ndash;219) 
  that humorously foreshadows the fortissimo return of the main theme on E. All 
  in all, the actual musical circumstances offer no substantiation even for a 
  V-I relationship between the C and the F (in the manner of Example 1a:ii2), 
  let alone for viewing the opening A as the III<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 of F&mdash;an inherently more 
  distant relationship which would require still stronger contextual support. 
  Instead of &ldquo;depending entirely upon context,&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s analysis would appear 
  to be based on a purely abstract contemplation of the A-C-F bass notes 
  and on totally ignoring their context. By such criteria, it is hard to see how 
  any progression away from the tonic could fail to constitute a &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary 
  cadence. (Indeed, I find it less counterintuitive to interpret any traditional 
  I-II<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3-V modulation as &ldquo;devaluing&rdquo; the tonic as the IV in a IV-V-I 
  cadence to the dominant; this, after all, is tonicized at one point.)</p>
<p> [11] This example, unfortunately, is not exceptional in its questionable reading 
  of basic tonal relationships; the second A-C-F &ldquo;cadence,&rdquo; spanning 
  measures 231&ndash;321, is by no means more plausible. For an example from another 
  composition, consider the last movement of Schumann&rsquo;s Fantasy op. 17, in which 
  Jackson views the opening C major as initiating a &ldquo;III-(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>V)-I&rdquo; auxiliary 
  cadence in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major (205&ndash;7, Example 8.8). Now it seems questionable indeed 
  whether a &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>V&rdquo; can function as a cadential dominant under any circumstances. 
  But even if we grant such a strange possibility, it seems mystifying why we 
  should see such a relationship between the &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>V,&rdquo; the E major chord in measure 10 
  (repeated in measure 12), and the &ldquo;I,&rdquo; the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> chord in measure 30, in the Schumann. The 
  long stretch of material separating these harmonies neither prolongs E major 
  nor directs the focus to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major but contains a powerful and fairly straightforward 
  prolongation of the dominant of the main key C major (measures 15&ndash;29). Jackson, 
  characteristically, does not discuss at all the problem with &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>V&rdquo;&mdash;though 
  the parentheses around it in his text (but not graph) might be understood as 
  some kind of a precautionary step against taking it too seriously.</p>

  <a name="pt3"></a>Excursion: Salience and Stability in Schumann&rsquo;s Fantasy op. 
  17</h3>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[12] These examples might suffice to give an idea of the quality of Jackson&rsquo;s 
  &ldquo;Observations,&rdquo; in general, and of the shaky groundwork of his key concept, 
  the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; auxiliary cadence, in particular. However, an excursion to one further, 
  especially interesting example, the first movement of Schumann&rsquo;s Fantasy, will 
  help to bring up some notions of general relevance for analysis. <b>Example 3</b> reproduces Jackson&rsquo;s overview of 
  this movement (his Example 8.2a). This reading, too, contains a tonic devaluation: 
  the C minor of the middle <i>Im Legendenton</i> section is conceived as the 
  upper fifth in a huge subdominant prolongation spanning measures 29&ndash;225. This 
  time the clue given by modal mixture (&ldquo;minor instead of major&rdquo;) is certainly 
  present. But, according to Jackson, an &ldquo;even more compelling&rdquo; indication of 
  the structural relationships is &ldquo;the initiation of the recapitulation on the 
  same II6/5/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 or IV<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 with added sixth (measure 225) as in the exposition (measure 29), 
  suggesting that <i>this</i> chord, as a neighbor to the prolonged V rather than 
  the intervening C minor chord, acquires fundamental significance&rdquo; (193&ndash;4). 
  The problem with the dissonance of this chord is not dealt with. In reference 
  to Fred Lerdahl&rsquo;s notions of <i>stability</i> and <i>salience</i> conditions 
  as structural determinants, it appears that Jackson regards the <i>salient</i> 
  return of a harmony as a &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; evidence of a structural connection, with 
  no concern for the conditions of harmonic <i>stability</i>&mdash;which include 
  (in Joseph Straus&rsquo;s terms) the consonance-dissonance condition and the scale-degree 
  condition.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
  That salience conditions may under some circumstances override stability conditions 
  in conventional tonality is, in my view, a perfectly plausible proposition. 
  However, if there is such an unstated proposition underlying Jackson&rsquo;s analysis, 
  it is applied in a most inconsistent way. In the Fantasy, the chord on F in 
  measure 29 is not the most likely candidate for a dissonant harmony elevated to structural 
  significance through salience.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 4</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=3&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 4 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex4_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p>                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=4&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 5 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p> [13] One might remark that if the chord in question is understood as a &ldquo;IV<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 
  with added sixth,&rdquo; the fifth, C, is not actually the dissonant element in it. 
  However, consideration of the context in which it occurs speaks clearly against 
  such an interpretation; see <b>Example 4</b>. C is resolved to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> as its appoggiatura 
  immediately in the subsequent measure (30), echoing several previous C- 
  B-natural resolutions (the last of which is shown in Example 4, measure 28). This 
  produces a <nobr>V<img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major, which, after turning to <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, is quite regularly 
  resolved in measure 33. This tonicized <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&mdash;which, incidentally, is an important 
  key in the later course of the Fantasy&mdash;shows itself nowhere in Jackson&rsquo;s 
  more detailed graph, reproduced in <b>Example 5a</b> (his Example 8.2b).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> 
  Instead, there is a C (measure 34)&mdash;picked, for some reason, from the midst of 
  a sequential bass line <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-C-A-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> (measures 33&ndash;36).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p> [14] <b>Example 5b</b> is a provisional sketch demonstrating that the first section (exposition) of 
  the Fantasy does lend itself to an interpretation better justified by the combination 
  of stability and salience. It contains one very significant exception to the 
  consonance-dissonance condition since it views the opening V9/7 as prolonged 
  throughout. Comparing this ninth chord with the chord on F (measure 29), it may be 
  noted, first of all, that its <i>salience</i> in the Fantasy is certainly still 
  much greater; hence the salience criterion would not speak for regarding the 
  return of the V9/7 in measure 98 as &ldquo;<u>not</u> yet structural dominant,&rdquo; as in Jackson&rsquo;s 
  analysis (Example 3). 
  What is even more important is that whereas the chord on F (the <nobr><img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>, to be precise) 
  is quite normally resolved in measure 33 (Example 4) there is no equally satisfactory 
  resolution for the V9/7 in measures 1&ndash;28. One might hear suggestions of a 9-8 
  resolution in measures 24&ndash;25 and 26&ndash;27 but they are not registrally clarified; 
  in addition, the seventh is constantly present until measure 28. Further, the 9<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>/7 
  chord in measure 28, which would appear to be connected with the preceding 9/7, is 
  clearly <i>not</i> resolved. Instead, its ninth is, in a very concrete manner, 
  transferred to the upper voice of the ensuing chord; see Example 4. As demonstrated by broken lines 
  in Example 4b, the <nobr><img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> on F is in its entirety formed by the four upper voices 
  of the preceding 9/7, altering B to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&mdash;a most unusual foreground event 
  suggesting that instead of being resolved, the dissonances offer a starting 
  point for subsequent events. </p>
<p> [15] Incidentally, I would also suggest that there are significant aspects 
  which make the V9/7 itself a special chord type and more than an arbitrary dissonance. 
  First, Schumann had a certain predilection for this chord&mdash;which in his 
  usage is often (as in the present case) conceivable as a superimposition of 
  V and II. Second, such chords, emancipated from their dominant function, assumed 
  an even more independent status in the music of Debussy and his generation&mdash;including, 
  to some extent, Sibelius. Third, such a historical development is, I would suggest, 
  influenced by the way in which the chord approximates the harmonic series: f2 
  and a2 correspond to harmonics 7 and 9 of G. Hence, even though the V9/7 is 
  dissonant in the syntax of conventional tonality, its tendency to assume a more 
  stable or independent role may have a (psycho)acoustical basis.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p> [16] Returning to Example 5b, the <nobr><img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord on F (measure 29) is an 
  important element in triggering a descending motion in parallel tenths but does 
  not occupy a high status in this motion. The subsequent <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major (measure 33), D 
  minor (measure 41), and C major (measure 61) chords are supported by stability and salience 
  alike. Each marks a clear-cut change in design. The indicated framework is also 
  supported by registral consistency and by the parallel use of introductory secondary 
  dominants (see brackets). Moreover, a point I would emphasize is that the large-scale 
  framework is not only an abstract skeleton but its aural significance is enhanced 
  by the correspondence with small-scale events. The long-range top-voice line 
  A2-G2-F2-E2-D2 replicates a primary foreground motive occuring 
  at its framing points.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
  In addition, Example 5c   illustrates several foreground occurrences of the beginning of this line, A-G-F, 
  and its variant, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-G-F, anticipating and confirming the corresponding 
  long-range event. In the realm of harmony, the important V-II relationship 
  (measures 1, 41) reflects the superimposition of these degrees in the opening harmony.</p>
<p>[17] While the justification for the choice of the framework points in Example 
  5b seems clear and conclusive, the internal hierarchy within this framework&mdash;especially 
  with respect to the D and C basses&mdash;is a more difficult issue that I will 
  leave open in this provisional reading. Two alternative interpretations are 
  sketched in Example 5d. 
  As regards thematic design, both D (measure 41) and C (measure 61) are highlighted by 
  similar material, evoking the keys of D minor and F major, respectively. In 
  the recapitulation, the D minor passage is transposed to C minor, parallel of 
  the home key. For these reasons, it would seem more natural to locate the beginning 
  of the &ldquo;second group&rdquo; at the D (measure 41) than at the C (measure 61), as in Jackson&rsquo;s 
  graph (Example 5a).</p>
<h3><a name="pt4"></a>Limits of Prolongational Thinking?</h3>
<p>[18] Although I think that Jackson&rsquo;s attempts to view the tonics in the Beethoven 
  and Schumann examples (Example 2, measure 12; Example 3, measure 134) as subordinate to another scale 
  degree (IV and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>VI, respectively) are equally mistaken, there is a significant 
  difference to be observed between these examples. In the Schumann, I find it 
  much easier to sympathize with the notion that the tonic in question, i.e., 
  the one in the <i>Im Legendenton</i> episode, does not yet constitute its &ldquo;definitive 
  arrival.&rdquo; Such an impression, moreover, does partly stem from the tonic&rsquo;s occurrence 
  &ldquo;in the wrong mode, minor instead of major.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I cannot think of 
  any convincing way to explain this by conceiving of the tonic as subordinate 
  to another harmony in a prolongational hierarchy (certainly not to a subdominant). 
  Perhaps we may take this as a healthy reminder that even the most fruitful analytical 
  notions are not without limitations. Even if the Schenkerian notion of hierarchically-organized, 
  temporally-continuous prolongational spans has done much to illuminate the organization 
  of tonal music, important aspects lie outside its scope. It would appear that 
  the distortions in Jackson&rsquo;s readings partly result from the neglect of this, 
  that is to say, from a misguided striving to view large-scale organization in 
  terms of overarching prolongational structures, as if other aspects of organization 
  could not cooperate in creating a meaningful whole. In the Fantasy, in particular, 
  there is a strong sense of <i>discontinuous</i> relationships assuming unusually 
  vital importance. I do not claim to know what kind of theoretical model would 
  best account for the minor tonic between two extended dominant prolongations 
  that appear connected. Perhaps it could be understood as a <i>parenthetical</i> 
  element&mdash;a notion employed in Edward Laufer&rsquo;s analysis of Sibelius&rsquo;s Seventh 
  Symphony, as discussed below.</p>
<p> [19] In this connection&mdash;to get finally closer to Sibelius&mdash;I would 
  also question whether a harmonic event such as the auxiliary cadence is the 
  only or even the most pertinent musical metaphor of &ldquo;crystallization.&rdquo; In introducing 
  this concept, Jackson appeals to Sibelius&rsquo;s description of the finale of his 
  Third Symphony as &ldquo;the crystallization of the idea from chaos&rdquo; (175).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
  In my view, an &ldquo;idea&rdquo; would seem to refer to the thematic-motivic rather than 
  the harmonic-prolongational aspect of organization. The auxiliary cadence certainly 
  involves an effect of <i>harmonic</i> clarification, or &ldquo;starting at some less 
  definite place and moving toward the point of tonic arrival,&rdquo; as Edward Laufer 
  put it in his analysis of Sibelius&rsquo;s Fourth Symphony in <i>Schenker Studies 
  2.</i><sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> However, 
  <i>thematic</i> crystallization needs also be recognized as a primary form-defining 
  resource in Sibelius&rsquo;s music&mdash;not only the Third Symphony&mdash;without any 
  necessary connection with some harmonic progression. If these considerations 
  bring to mind Schenker&rsquo;s polemical distinction between &ldquo;fundamental structure&rdquo; 
  composers and &ldquo;idea&rdquo; composers, I would suggest that it is hardly among those 
  of his notions that we should be loyal to.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
  For Sibelius, at least, both aspects are of paramount importance.</p>
<p> [20] I will mention only a few examples showing that the reliability of Jackson&rsquo;s 
  analyses by no means improves when proceeding from the tonal tradition to Sibelius. 
  <i>Lemmink&auml;inen&rsquo;s Return</i> poses an analytical problem comparable with 
  the Schumann: it contains an episode in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> minor (measure 243 ff.) which, admittedly, 
  appears as less &ldquo;decisive&rdquo; than the eventual <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major tonic. Most certainly, 
  however, this cannot be explained by conceiving of the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> minor as subordinate 
  to a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> supporting a <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> (B-D-G) in measure 365, as indicated by 
  Jackson&rsquo;s graph (Example 8.15a). First, there is no <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> but <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> (B-<i>E</i>-G) 
  in the score. Second, a root-position <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> minor triad as subordinate to such 
  a <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> seems an inherently unlikely relationship. Third, in its context, the 
  <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> is readily understood as a local neighbor to the dominant <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr><nobr><sup>7</sup></nobr> (measure 367)&mdash;an 
  interesting and idiosyncratic foreground feature having its roots in measure 67. 
  One general peculiarity in Jackson&rsquo;s arguments concerns the impact of <i>duration</i> 
  for structure. Frequently he appeals to the short duration of the tonic when 
  arguing for its subordinate structural status. However, brevity does not prevent 
  other harmonies from gaining structural weight. One extreme example is given 
  by the finale of the <i>Third Symphony,</i> in which Jackson sees the dominant 
  as governing for the first 245 measures (Example 8.19), even though the opening 
  dominant resolves straightforwardly to the tonic in measure 4, followed by a tonic 
  pedal (with little digressions) until measure 41, and also nothing in the subsequent 
  material suggests a connection with the dominant. Hence, while it is in itself 
  reasonable to regard duration as one of the salience conditions, this condition 
  is inconsistently applied by Jackson. In fact, I find no other way to account 
  for many of his analytical decisions than presuming an unstated &ldquo;negative&rdquo; scale-degree 
  condition or preference rule: &ldquo;Strongly prefer any other scale-degree as superior 
  to the tonic&mdash;unless it is the last tonic in the piece.&rdquo; In the <i>Seventh 
  Symphony,</i> Jackson argues that the root-position tonic in measures 60&ndash;67 
  is subordinate to the I6 in measures 82&ndash;83 on the grounds that &ldquo;the definitive 
  achievement of the primary tone <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&rdquo; occurs above the latter (266)&mdash;certainly 
  a criterion whose adoption would revolutionize all Schenkerian practices thus 
  far (consider, e.g., Mozart&rsquo;s Sonata in A major, KV. 331, measure 1). Jackson sees, 
  however, nothing worth discussing in his analytical criterion but speaks of 
  &ldquo;an odd way of composing, &lsquo;placing the cart before the horse&rsquo;,&rdquo; (ibid.). This 
  is one of the instances in which unintentional humor is produced by equating 
  the properties of analysis with those of composition.</p>
<p>[21] All in all, despite the impressive scope of issues raised by Jackson, 
  the grounds for his analytical readings are so shaky that the conclusions from 
  these readings have little worth in illuminating such issues. And while the 
  project of illuminating Sibelius&rsquo;s music analytically is very welcome, it is 
  regrettable that the editors of <i>Sibelius Studies</i> showed such a lack of 
  judgment as to assign a lion&rsquo;s share of the book to such untenable material. Perhaps 
  one might find the raising of important issues as something of a merit in itself. 
  One certainly hopes that Jackson&rsquo;s article would inspire or provoke more competent 
  analytical work viewing the historical evolution of symphonic music from a structural 
  perspective.</p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="pt5"></a>Considerations of Multikey Schemes</h3>
<p>[22] The auxiliary cadence warrants consideration also as the basis for explaining 
  tonal organization in pieces that begin and end in a different key. Despite 
  convincing exemplars of such an explanation, starting from Schenker himself, 
  there is no justification for applying it automatically to all multikey schemes 
  (as seems to be Jackson&rsquo;s practice).<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
  The interpretation of an entire movement or composition in terms of a unified, 
  end-oriented harmonic progression is a complex analytical statement that requires 
  specific factors to support it. Regarding such factors, I would, once again, 
  emphasize the significance of foreground for understanding background. If foreground 
  motives or harmonic details are heard as pointing to or &ldquo;striving for&rdquo; the final 
  tonic prior to its decisive arrival, this arrival will be more readily experienced 
  as a tonal goal having an &ldquo;organic&rdquo; connection with the beginning. Such interrelationships 
  across levels are the more essential the more complex the overall progression 
  is and the more time it takes to get to the final tonic. Two Chopin examples 
  illustrate this. In a short piece such as the Prelude op. 28 no. 2, the simple 
  V-I relationship will &ldquo;make sense&rdquo; even though the opening motives in no 
  way point to the eventual A minor tonic (but rather to the keys of the subsequent 
  preludes, interestingly enough).<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
  On the other hand, the more complex progression VI-V-I spanning most 
  of the Fantasy op. 49 gains essential support from foreground elements that 
  refer to the relationship between the opening F minor and the final <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major. 
  As pointed out by Carl Schachter, the major second formed by the pitches separating 
  F-minor from the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-major triad, F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, plays an important motivic role 
  right from the start.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[23] These considerations bear interestingly on Sibelius&rsquo;s music and its analysis. 
  Two significant works, <i>Lemmink&auml;inen&rsquo;s Return</i> and <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter</i> 
  progress from minor to relative major as does Chopin&rsquo;s Fantasy. Moreover, just 
  as in the Chopin, the whole-tone emblematic of the key change, <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>7</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in 
  the minor or <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>6</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>-<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in the major, features as an important foreground element 
  in both works&mdash;one token of their &ldquo;richness of interconnectedness,&rdquo; to quote 
  Adorno&rsquo;s expression. These relationships are observed by Jackson concerning 
  <i>Lemmink&auml;inen&rsquo;s Return</i> (219) and by Timo Virtanen in his special 
  chapter on <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter</i> (169). In these works, viewing the key 
  relationships in terms of end-oriented progressions seems concordant with their 
  musical effect and also with the programmatic content of &ldquo;homeward journey.&rdquo; 
  However, these progressions may not be literally auxiliary cadences since there 
  is no dominant linking the VI and the I&mdash;unless the first occurrence of 
  the latter is regarded as non-structural.</p>
<p>[24] Virtanen&rsquo;s and Jackson&rsquo;s readings of <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter</i> contrast 
  in this respect. Virtanen views the arrival at the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major tonic as marked 
  by the &ldquo;heroic theme&rdquo; in measure 53 (169, Example 7.5), while Jackson (characteristically 
  enough) locates the &ldquo;DTA&rdquo; only in the final measure 257, preceded by V in measure 
  243 (Example 8.16). According to the former reading, the VI (G minor) connects directly 
  to I (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major) through a neighboring relationship&mdash;a case comparable to Chopin&rsquo;s 
  Scherzo op. 31, as analyzed by Schenker.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
  To me, Virtanen&rsquo;s reading seems more plausible. Jackson&rsquo;s contention that the 
  earlier <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> arrivals &ldquo;are devalued [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] by the hegemony of the G minor-major 
  prolongation&rdquo; (220) lacks substantiation by any special features that would 
  fortify that &ldquo;hegemony&rdquo; by pointing specifically to G after the opening (such 
  as a dividing dominant or an emphatic return). Intuitively, moreover, the &ldquo;heroic 
  theme&rdquo; seems a more likely candidate of something &ldquo;crystallized&rdquo; or &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; 
  than the closing unison G-A-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> &mdash;a rather shadowy reminder of 
  the G-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> relationship. (In this case, thematic crystallization and tonal 
  clarification seem to be in synchrony.) The first occurrence of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is abruptly 
  interrupted by tonally distant material in measure 57 but even if this in some sense 
  undermines the &ldquo;definiteness&rdquo; of the tonic, such an effect may have nothing 
  to do with a lower status in a prolongational structure. It would seem that 
  extra-musical considerations are essential for explaining this abrupt shift: 
  programmatically the passage depicts the sudden apparition of Pohjola&rsquo;s daughter 
  on the rainbow to interrupt V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen&rsquo;s (the male hero&rsquo;s) journey.</p>
<p>[25] Virtanen&rsquo;s discussion on the relationship between the program and the 
  musical structure is illuminating and nuanced. However, the informative value 
  and persuasiveness of his analysis, too, would have profited from a closer consideration 
  of details; his graphs only show the background and deep middleground levels 
  (Example 7.5). As will be discussed below, there are quite nontraditional aspects 
  in the compositional technique of <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter</i> and it would have 
  been worthwhile to flesh out whether and how such aspects can be related to 
  a linear construct emerging from the tonal tradition such as the <i>Ursatz.</i> 
  Having said this, I have to add that the pacing and weighting of structural 
  events in Virtanen&rsquo;s analysis appears by no means counterintuitive. To be fair, 
  it should also be observed that Virtanen&rsquo;s focus is not only on analysis but 
  on sketch studies as well.</p>
<p> [26] That multikey schemes cannot always be so convincingly explained as embodying 
  a unified, end-oriented harmonic progression is exemplified by the symphonic 
  ballad <i>The Wood Nymph</i> (<i>Skogsr&aring;et</i>)&mdash;an early work (1895) 
  recently &ldquo;rediscovered&rdquo; with great public attention after over half a century 
  with few performances. Its lack of clear tonal orientation is reflected in the 
  two readings of this composition in <i>Sibelius Studies.</i> Whereas Jackson 
  sees the piece as embodying a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>VII-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>II-V-I progression in the 
  <i>final</i> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> minor (215 ff.), Veijo Murtom&auml;ki, in his special chapter 
  on <i>The Wood Nymph,</i> views it as progressing from I to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>IIn [n = natural] 
  in the <i>opening</i> C major (Example 6.1). (The &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>IIn&rdquo; in Murtom&auml;ki&rsquo;s 
  analysis is illogical since <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> minor is either <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>I or, enharmonically, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>II<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> , 
  in C major.) It is not easy to see how one or the other of these interpretations 
  would have greater merit in illuminating the organization. In fact, there may 
  be little grounds for viewing the key succession in terms of an overarching 
  harmonic progression in the first place. To listeners such as myself, <i>The 
  Wood Nymph</i> makes the impression of a loosely interwoven series of more or 
  less improvisatory mood depictions, rather than a unified composition with a 
  pervasive harmonic organization. Attempts to posit such organization may be 
  attempts to make the piece something more than it is.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
  This impression of <i>The Wood Nymph</i> is well in accordance with the view 
  held by earlier scholars&mdash;and even confirmed by Sibelius himself&mdash;that 
  the orchestral ballad was rather quickly written on the basis of a melodrama 
  with the same title comprising four separate episodes (accompaniment to a poem 
  by Viktor Rydberg). This order of composition between the two versions of <i>The 
  Wood Nymph</i> is contested by Murtom&auml;ki (100&ndash;1), but, in my view, 
  it would readily explain the character of the ballad. Be the compositional history 
  of <i>The Wood Nymph</i> as it may, it is not easy to find musical factors that 
  would support conceiving it as a unified harmonic progression. The progression 
  would be complex and take a long time but gain hardly any support from correspondence 
  with lower-level organization. In fact, <i>The Wood Nymph</i> is characterized 
  not only by the lack of details reflecting the large-scale organization but 
  by a certain poverty of details in general. In my view, its lengthy monotonous 
  passages are actually more suitable for the accompaniment of poetry than for 
  listening by itself.</p>
<p>[27] (In this connection I would suggest that while the distinction between 
  absolute and programmatic music is not clear-cut, a relative distinction remains 
  essential for understanding Sibelius. For the symphonies, one could perhaps, 
  at best, invent programmatic interpretations&mdash;Jackson attempts this&mdash;that 
  are concordant with the musical experience but would add nothing essential to 
  it. For the symphonic poems and <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter</i>&mdash;a &ldquo;Symphonic 
  Fantasy&rdquo;&mdash;programmatic considerations may considerably illuminate passages 
  that otherwise seem strange. Finally, a melodrama-based work such as <i>The 
  Wood Nymph</i> makes little sense without knowing the program depicted in the 
  poem.)</p>
<p>[28] These considerations bear on the evaluation of the aesthetic quality and 
  the recent reception of <i>The Wood Nymph.</i> Murtom&auml;ki begins his article: 
  &ldquo;The performance in 1996 of [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] <i>Skogsr&aring;et</i> [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] was a sensation. 
  It was clear that the orchestral ballad was a masterpiece whose inclusion in 
  the canon of Sibelius&rsquo;s major orchestral works would decisively change our view 
  of the composer.&rdquo; (95) However, to me at least, the masterpiece quality of 
  <i>The Wood Nymph</i> remains unclear. As important as it is to recognize that 
  the Adornian virtues, &ldquo;the richness of inter-connectedness&rdquo; and &ldquo;unity in diversity,&rdquo; 
  actually became hallmarks of Sibelius&rsquo;s more mature symphonic works, it is just 
  as vain, I am afraid, to search for them in <i>The Wood Nymph.</i> Ultimately, 
  Murtom&auml;ki comes close to my view as he writes: &ldquo;as a whole, <i>Skogsr&aring;et 
  </i>is not a highly unified organism like Sibelius&rsquo;s subsequent large orchestral 
  works&rdquo; (123). Further, &ldquo;when he [Sibelius] does try to bridge the gap between 
  sections with a true transition [<nobr>. . .</nobr>], the result is only partially satisfying&rdquo; 
  (ibid.). To justify his initial praise, he appeals to genre: &ldquo;the &lsquo;profound 
  logic&rsquo; [Sibelius&rsquo;s expression] and close thematic interconnectedness characteristic 
  of the symphony was [sic] not required of the ballad&rdquo; (ibid.). Such a contention 
  is, of course, legitimate. Analytical considerations cannot prove or disprove 
  whether the Adornian virtues&mdash;or the &ldquo;profound logic&rdquo; which later became 
  a characteristically Sibelian virtue&mdash;are prerequisites for a &ldquo;masterpiece.&rdquo; 
  Nevertheless, against Murtom&auml;ki&rsquo;s praise I suppose I have an equal right 
  to assert that the inclusion of <i>The Wood Nymph</i> &ldquo;in the canon of Sibelius&rsquo;s 
  major orchestral works,&rdquo; on a par with his symphonies, the mature symphonic 
  poems, or even the <i>Lemmink&auml;inen</i> legends, would confuse rather than 
  promote a sound view of Sibelius&rsquo;s accomplishment. I find less reason to wonder 
  &ldquo;why should a major work like <i>Skogsr&aring;et</i> have languished unperformed 
  for decades&rdquo; (95) than to ponder the state of a music culture in which sensations 
  are so much more readily made from the lesser works of established masters than 
  from more interesting music by more recent composers. (All this is not to deny 
  the musicological and biographical interest of <i>The Wood Nymph</i> or a certain 
  charm of some of its episodes.)</p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="pt6"></a>Laufer&rsquo;s Case Study: Inspiration and Realism</h3>
<p>[29] What may be regarded as the most substantial analytical contribution in 
  <i>Sibelius Studies</i> is its final chapter, Edward Laufer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Continuity and 
  design in the Seventh Symphony.&rdquo; While Laufer&rsquo;s aims are more modest than Jackson&rsquo;s, 
  the discussion of the musical material in a single one-movement piece, he accomplishes 
  immeasurably more by the careful and insightful consideration of that material. 
  The complexities in this symphony are formidable; neither the composition nor 
  the unraveling of them is a small feat. And even if we are ultimately to aim 
  at more comprehensive historical comparisons, they become possible only <i>after</i> 
  such careful case studies.</p>
<p>[30] The inclusion of Laufer&rsquo;s analysis in <i>Sibelius Studies</i> is welcome 
  for promoting both Sibelius among Schenkerians and Schenker among Sibelians. 
  <i>Sibelius Studies</i> is a book likely to have readers with little previous 
  experience in Schenkerian analysis. In such readers, Jackson&rsquo;s paper may create 
  the impression of &ldquo;Schenkerianism&rdquo; as an approach drawing its conclusions from 
  abstract large-scale relationships between more or less arbitrarily chosen notes, 
  with no substantiation in the concrete &ldquo;surface&rdquo; material or in the principles 
  of tonal syntax. Laufer&rsquo;s study is appropriate to dispel any such impression. 
  His attention to &ldquo;surface&rdquo; is amply manifest in the meticulous foreground graphs 
  that pervasively accompany the large-scale readings.</p>
<p>[31] Laufer&rsquo;s analysis combines inspiration with realism. To the intuitions 
  of Sibelians, Adorno&rsquo;s charges of &ldquo;senseless juxtaposition&rdquo; have never made 
  much sense, but it is a joy to encounter such a thorough analytical rationalization 
  of such intuitions (spiced, characteristically, with frequent exclamations of 
  admiration). As for Schenkerian analysis, it would seem that Laufer&rsquo;s experience 
  with this approach has yielded, aside from the admirable command of it, a realistic 
  view of its explanatory scope. One is almost surprised by the share of &ldquo;non-Schenkerian&rdquo; 
  observations in his paper, that is to say, motivic and other surface relationships 
  <i>not</i> supported by any parallelism in the voice-leading structure. I feel 
  tempted to say that, <i>pace</i> Schenker, Laufer values the fundamental structure 
  less for its own sake than for the substratum it offers for the development 
  of ideas.</p>
<p>[32] After Jackson&rsquo;s obsession with tonic devaluation, it was something of 
  a relief to see several genuine tonics within the overall organization. What 
  should be observed, however, is the nuanced way Laufer discusses a variety of 
  tonic and tonic-like effects. There are, naturally, non-structural &ldquo;tonics,&rdquo; 
  subordinate to another harmony&mdash;but even such a harmony may suggest &ldquo;the 
  <i>sound</i> (but not the meaning) of the tonic&rdquo; (372). If such subordination 
  is not the case, a tonic may function in &ldquo;a parenthetical insertion within the 
  larger musical direction&mdash;as if two interpretations, the continuous and 
  the discontinuous, were superimposed.&rdquo; (376) The interaction of tonal-harmonic 
  functions with modal and thematic features is lucidly captured in Laufer&rsquo;s description 
  of the effect of &ldquo;main section II,&rdquo; (measure 222 ff.). Although the tonic is here 
  neither non-structural nor parenthetical, &ldquo;in terms of the larger formal plan, 
  this section is transitory [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] The &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; notes of the minor mode imply 
  this, as does the incomplete presentation of the main theme[<nobr>. . .</nobr>].&rdquo; (372) 
  Modal and thematic aspects have thus an essential function in the music <i>without</i> 
  altering the harmonic function. This suggests a picture of the overall organization 
  based on several interacting aspects or &ldquo;parameters&rdquo; rather than on a single 
  all-encompassing one&mdash;at once a richer and more realistic picture, in my 
  view.</p>

<p>[33] In general, Laufer&rsquo;s readings are cogent and revealing. While he makes 
  few references to the previous analytical work on the Seventh Symphony, its 
  future analysts would do well to consult Laufer&rsquo;s paper. At points, alternative 
  interpretations come to mind (which, of course, is nothing that could or should 
  be avoided). Some of these concern apparent repetitions of similar material 
  which Laufer interprets in radically deviant ways. I do not wish to suggest 
  that he does not have grounds for such deviations. Nevertheless, I think that 
  for the majority of readers such grounds are not evident and these readers would 
  have gained from making them evident. (If such discussion was omitted for reasons 
  of space, this makes the &ldquo;self-generous&rdquo; editorial policy all the more regrettable.) 
  One such instance occurs in the climax of &ldquo;main section I,&rdquo; shown as score reduction 
  in <b>Example 6a</b>. 
  <b>Example 6b</b> aligns Laufer&rsquo;s reading (from his Example 12.2.4) with the score. The 
  passage in measures 84&ndash;86 is a varied transposition of measures 80&ndash;82, but Laufer 
  interprets it quite differently; see brackets. In measure 80, he shows the outer-voice 
  Bs in the unaccented <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord as passing, while in measure 84 the corresponding 
  Gs assume structural importance. <b>Example 6c</b> shows one possible way to view these 
  passages in a more analogous way. Significantly, this reading would not affect 
  the wider consequences of Laufer&rsquo;s analysis. </p>
<p>[34] Perhaps the most surprising detail in Laufer&rsquo;s reading is, however, the 
  high status of the bass C in measure 80, shown as supporting the top-voice G. The 
  preceding <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is described by Laufer as &ldquo;technically a lower neighbor note&rdquo; (378, 
  n. 10). In this one detail, I would actually question the structural status 
  of a tonic in Laufer&rsquo;s analysis. In view of the preceding E minor tonicization, 
  I find it natural to hear the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> bass as an <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> supporting an &ldquo;inverted German 
  6th&rdquo; or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>IV7, as indicated in Example 6c. The C in measure 80 would then prolong 
  that harmony before arriving at B, the V of E minor, in measure 81&mdash;a bass tone 
  not shown at all in Laufer&rsquo;s otherwise meticulous graph. The bass line <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-B-C-B 
  produces an additional occurrence of the turn-figure, a central motivic element 
  in the symphony, as observed by Laufer and others before him. In this reading, 
  the structural bass C is reached only at the end of measure 81 (a point underlined 
  by a timpani roll among other things), through a progression which from the 
  E minor perspective sounds like a deceptive cadence. The E minor implications 
  might also speak for a somewhat higher status for the E bass in measures 82&ndash;83. 
  <b>Example 6d</b>  is a very tentative sketch of the underlying progression in measures 60&ndash;82. 
  Significantly, the E minor implications are later realized with utmost force 
  in the recapitulation of this section (measure 495).<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>
<h3><br>
  <a name="pt7"></a>Aspects of Modernism</h3>
<p>[35] The less conventional features in Sibelius&rsquo;s music include both those 
  related to the general trends of contemporary modernism and those whose cultivation 
  belonged more specifically to his personal style&mdash;but which might, to some 
  extent, be seen as adumbrating some later trends. The former group contains 
  aspects such as <i>modal/scalar/pc-set</i> material, <i>motivic</i> organization, 
  and <i>harmonic</i> usages. In <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> the <i>mode/scale/pc-set</i> 
  issue is focused on by Elliot Antokoletz, who examines the interaction of different 
  diatonic and cyclic-interval (whole-tone and octatonic) resources in the Fourth 
  Symphony, drawing a parallel with composers such as Bart&oacute;k and Stravinsky 
  (297). A central concern for <i>motivic</i> relationships is a trait Sibelius 
  shares with several of his contemporaries. In <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> the most 
  comprehensive motivic study is Laufer&rsquo;s analysis of the Seventh Symphony; however, 
  in accordance with the work itself, this study is less pertinent to the role 
  of motives in modernism. Laufer&rsquo;s basic figures are &ldquo;rather unassuming&rdquo; (358) 
  common diatonic figures: intervals, scalar fillings, and turns; only the careful 
  consideration of their moment-by-moment transformation substantiates their work-specific 
  significance. That the Symphony grows out of such material tells much about 
  its special character as an essay on diatonicism (not only <i>in</i> but <i>on</i> 
  C major). The tonally more radical Fourth Symphony might have been cited also 
  as an example based on more &ldquo;high profile&rdquo; or individual motives, which, rather 
  than arising from a traditional tonal substratum, assume an active role in influencing 
  tonal relationships. The way in which work-specific motivic forces partly substitute 
  for tonal forces as agents of coherence suggests a point of contact with Schoenbergian 
  thought. Incidentally, it is partly thanks to such &ldquo;high profile&rdquo; motivic work 
  that Sibelius remained as an important source of influence for the symphonic 
  work of dodecaphonists of later generations such as Joonas Kokkonen and Paavo 
  Heininen&mdash;music little known outside Finland but, in my view, much more 
  worth listening to and promoting than pieces such as <i>The Wood Nymph.</i></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 7</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=6&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 7 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex7_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>


<p>[36] Regarding Sibelius&rsquo;s <i>harmonic</i> usages and their relationship with 
  the trends of early 20th-century music, I will discuss only one passage from 
  the Seventh Symphony (measures 107&ndash;49). Laufer observes the use of &ldquo;characteristic 
  Sibelian ninth-chord sonorities&rdquo; in measures 115&ndash;8, adding that &ldquo;[t]hese are 
  only apparent ninth chords&rdquo;; they are brought forth by &ldquo;rhythmic shifts [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] 
  indicated by slanted lines in the sketch&rdquo; (365); <b>Example 7a</b> gathers information from several 
  of Laufer&rsquo;s graphs (Examples 12.9.3, 12.10.3, and 12.12.6; the <i>glissando</i> 
  signs in Example 7a stand for omitted scalar fillings). These &ldquo;ninth-chord sonorities&rdquo; 
  are of the type discussed in connection with Schumann&rsquo;s Fantasy; their registration 
  corresponds more or less closely to the harmonic series. In fact, this sonority 
  is introduced already in measure 95 alongside the thematic material that it pervasively 
  accompanies. What is perhaps the most characteristically Sibelian feature in 
  this usage is the lower-fifth relationship between the bass and the minor mode 
  (ascending melodic) suggested by the melody. (In measure 95 there is a superimposition 
  of IV and i rather than V and ii as in the Schumann.) That such a device was 
  consciously employed by Sibelius is implied by a lecture he gave as early as 
  1896.</p>
<p>[37] Laufer&rsquo;s interpretation implies that ninths are assumed to have their 
  conventional status as dissonances. Such an assumption is by no means implausible 
  since other parts of the symphony show clear 9-8 resolutions. Significantly, 
  however, in measures 107&ndash;47 the harmonic organization may be described as based 
  entirely on transpositions of this ninth chord&mdash;before the dramatic arrival 
  in measures 148&ndash;9 at a rhythmically varied repetition of earlier material (measures 
  88&ndash;89). Such an extended prevalence suggests considering this chord as 
  something more than &ldquo;apparent.&rdquo; <b>Example 7b</b> shows an alternative reading based 
  on the assumption that the ninth is momentarily &ldquo;emancipated&rdquo; from its dissonant 
  status to become structurally supportive. This reading shows a much simpler 
  relationship with the actual events and their articulation. In measures 107&ndash;133 
  the bass traverses from C to C through a descending whole-tone scale, articulated 
  in two parallel halves, C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-C. This parallelism is more clearly 
  reflected in Example 7b. 
  This Example views the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> as a prominent neighbor of G, a function also evident 
  at the foreground in the framing points of the progression (measures 107, 133; small 
  notes in Example 7b. 
  (The great-octave Db that Laufer shows in measure 119 without parentheses does not 
  actually occur at that point, another rare exception to his carefulness.) In 
  the top voice, again, the parallelism between the descending thirds D-C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 
  (measures 115&ndash;7) and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-E (128&ndash;30) is only evident in Example 
  7b; 
  these third-progressions may be viewed as horizontalizations of an interval 
  (ninth-seventh) in the harmonies on C and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>. Further, in measures 133&ndash;49, 
  the assumption of the structural status of the ninth chord would justify a higher 
  status for the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (measure 143), a status also supported by its registral placement 
  (in measure 146). The bass line C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-(F)-G in Example 7b has a closer 
  relationship with the concrete material than Laufer&rsquo;s C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-G, 
  in which the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> does not actually occur.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>[38] It should be noted that this kind of use of parallel ninth chords was 
  by no means innovative in 1924 when the Seventh Symphony was completed. Similar 
  techniques were employed by composers such as Debussy and Scriabin some two 
  decades earlier. The analytical problem of the extent to which the triadic norms 
  of consonance etc. can be assumed to underlie linear progressions in music that 
  momentarily appear to manifest another kind of consistent organization has relevance 
  for a large body of early 20th-century music.</p>
<p>[39] Among the unconventional Sibelian features that are less closely connected 
  with general contemporary trends, we may identify aspects of <i>Satztechnik</i> 
  and <i>form.</i> By <i>Satztechnik</i> I refer generally to the basic harmonic 
  and contrapuntal principles underlying the formation of surface textures, which, 
  in the tonal tradition, include outer-voice counterpoint, thorough bass, and 
  I-V polarity. Sibelius&rsquo;s music is, at times, far removed from these principles, 
  even when the scalar material is diatonic and in that respect makes a less &ldquo;modern&rdquo; 
  impression. This kind of nontraditionalism is essential for understanding Adorno&rsquo;s 
  characterization of Sibelius: &ldquo;&lsquo;themes,&rsquo; some completely unplastic and trivial 
  successions of pitches, are put forth, most of the time never once harmonized, 
  instead <i>unisono</i> with organ points, stationary harmonies and whatever 
  else the five-line staff will produce in order to avoid logical harmonic progression&rdquo; 
  (cited in xviii). Hence, to Adorno and his followers, Sibelius was nontraditional 
  in a wrong way&mdash;but, to be sure, Adorno&rsquo;s negative aesthetic judgement is 
  invalidated by his inability to perceive and appreciate the compensating accomplishments 
  in aspects such as multi-level motivic relationships and novel temporal effects.</p>
<p>[40] As a demonstrative example of Sibelius&rsquo;s nontraditional <i>Satztechnik,</i> 
  one may consult the opening of <i>Pohjola&rsquo;s Daughter.</i> As described by Virtanen, 
  &ldquo;the center of gravity is shifted almost imperceptibly from the G minor to the 
  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major, and without traditional modulatory procedures&rdquo; (169). In the first 
  fifty or so measures (or in most of the subsequent material, for that matter) 
  one finds no single event that could be called a conventional chord succession; 
  instead there is a more or less &ldquo;amorphous&rdquo; harmonic framework for complex motivic 
  elaboration and for the gradual shift of tonal focus.</p>
<p> [41] The nontraditional features of <i>Satztechnik</i> have important ramifications 
  for analysis. If the traditional principles of <i>Satz</i> do not prevail, we 
  may ask how this should be allowed for in applying a method deeply rooted in 
  these principles such as Schenkerian analysis. This issue is not systematically 
  discussed by Schenkerians in <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> although Laufer does point 
  out characteristically Sibelian practices of ellipsis, shifts, anticipations 
  and the like, relating thus the apparently nontraditional with the traditional.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> However, as with the ninth chords discussed above, there is reason to ask where 
  we should place the borderline between &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; and &ldquo;real&rdquo; nontraditionalism, 
  in other words, at what point we gain a better insight of the music by treating 
  the previously exceptional as having become normative. Since Sibelius never 
  totally abandonded traditional means, a double perspective is, generally speaking, 
  recommendable. To cite one example, Laufer reads an evaded <nobr>II<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>-V-I 
  cadence in measure 92 of the Seventh Symphony, showing a non-existent G (V) in parentheses 
  (Example 12.2). On the one hand, such a reading is informative since it points out 
  the &ldquo;conspicuous absence&rdquo; of the dominant, which at other crucial points of 
  the symphony still plays a primary role. On the other hand, progressions avoiding 
  the dominant occur frequently in Sibelius and it might be desirable to try to 
  find alternative explanations for such progressions, based on what is present 
  rather than what is absent.</p>
<p>[42]<i> Form</i> is often considered as the main progressive aspect in Sibelius&rsquo;s 
  music. The conventional wisdom&mdash;at least here in Finland&mdash;is that while 
  Sibelius after the Fourth Symphony ceased to follow the general trends of contemporary 
  modernism with respect to pitch material, this was compensated for by the ongoing 
  cultivation of innovative formal language. This contrasts with Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
  music, in which, to cite the editors, &ldquo;conservatism in rhythmic and formal dimensions 
  sometimes counterbalances radicalism in the post-tonal harmonic language&rdquo; (xv). 
  Against these considerations, the treatment of form in <i>Sibelius Studies</i> 
  is, at times, something of a disappointment. The description of form is often 
  based on traditional schemes such as sonata form, rondo, and, in Jackson&rsquo;s paper, 
  &ldquo;super-sonata,&rdquo; even when matching Sibelius&rsquo;s imaginative treatment of form 
  would require more imaginative analysis. For example, Antokoletz&rsquo;s description 
  of the third movement, <i>Il tempo largo,</i> of the Fourth Symphony as a &ldquo;sonata 
  allegro&rdquo; (313) seems rather insensitive to its essential features in both the 
  thematic and the tonal-harmonic respect. I would cite this movement as one in 
  which Sibelius is at the height of his powers with respect to progressive pitch 
  material, motivic concentration, <i>as well as</i> formal originality (to say 
  nothing about emotional depth)&mdash;properties that make it, in my view, one 
  of the greatest accomplishments not only in Sibelius&rsquo;s output but in twentieth-century 
  music in general. Its form may be described as an archetypal exemplification 
  of thematic crystallization: melodic &ldquo;well-shapedness&rdquo; is employed as a key 
  &ldquo;parameter&rdquo; that reaches its apex near the end (measures 82&ndash;87). Such a view 
  of its form is by no means my contribution but represents &ldquo;conventional wisdom.&rdquo; 
  Perhaps, however, such &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; is less self-evident for the international readership; 
  therefore more comprehensive discussion on Sibelius&rsquo;s characteristic formal 
  practices&mdash;from small to overall scale&mdash;might not have been out of place 
  in a book like <i>Sibelius Studies.</i></p>
<p>[43] Two essays in <i>Sibelius Studies</i> deal expressly with aspects of form. 
  In accordance with the above considerations, Tim Howell&rsquo;s &ldquo;&lsquo;Sibelius the Progressive&rsquo;&rdquo; 
  cites &ldquo;Sibelius&rsquo;s control of musical time scale&rdquo; as &ldquo;perhaps the single most 
  progressive aspect of his compositional technique&rdquo; (55). He suggests parallels 
  between the &ldquo;forward-looking characteristics of <i>Tapiola</i>&rdquo; (ibid.) and 
  the &ldquo;manipulation of sound masses in the music of Ligeti&rdquo; (56) and &ldquo;comparisons 
  between the formal processes of the Seventh Symphony and Elliot Carter&rsquo;s <i>Concerto 
  for Orchestra</i>&rdquo; (ibid.). The &ldquo;amorphous&rdquo; qualities of <i>Satztechnik</i> 
  pointed out above may also be seen as distantly related with &ldquo;sound masses.&rdquo; 
  However, even if there is some resemblance between Sibelius&rsquo;s nontraditionalism 
  and the above-mentioned avant-garde trends of the 1960s, this is hardly based 
  on an influential relationship. The outspoken avant-garde admirers of Sibelius 
  mentioned by Howell represent more recent decades. On the other hand, more conscious 
  influence of Sibelian formal thinking could be found in the music of Finnish 
  modernists&mdash;such as those mentioned above.</p>
<p>[44] More specified notions for the treatment of form in Sibelius are set forth 
  by James Hepokoski. In his interesting discussion, Hepokoski recognizes Sibelius&rsquo;s 
  conscious &ldquo;shift away from traditional <i>Formenlehre</i> structures&rdquo; (322) 
  and offers the concepts of <i>rotational form</i> and <i>teleological genesis</i> 
  for coping with characteristically Sibelian procedures. Rotational form means 
  &ldquo;a structural process within which a basic thematic or rhetoric pattern [<nobr>. . .</nobr>] 
  is subsequently treated to a series of immediate, though often substantially 
  varied, repetitions.&rdquo; (325) Teleological genesis, &ldquo;the gradual production and 
  shaping of a cumulative goal (<i>telos</i>),&rdquo; (327) corresponds more or less 
  closely to what I have called &ldquo;thematic crystallization.&rdquo;</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 8</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="vaisala_examples.php?id=7&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 8 thumbnail" src="vaisala_ex8_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>


<p>[45] There is no doubt that these concepts are productive in Sibelius analysis. 
  However, while Hepokoski&rsquo;s application of them to the finale of the Sixth Symphony 
  is illuminating, some questions might be stated as to what actually distinguishes 
  a rotation from a non-rotation, in other words, as to the relative importance 
  of elements suggesting repetition, on the one hand, and contrast, on the other. 
  As pointed out by Hepokoski, the opening motives, i.e., those in Rotation 1 
  (measures 1&ndash;16), &ldquo;supply most of the raw materials for the peak moment, although 
  they are not yet sounded in <i>telos</i> order&rdquo; (341); this order is only achieved 
  in Rotation 3 (measures 55&ndash;82). However, if the order of elements is changed, 
  one may wonder the extent to which one can still speak of a repeated &ldquo;rhetoric 
  pattern.&rdquo; On the other hand, the closing Rotation 9, &ldquo;one of whose points is 
  to demonstrate the valedictory abandonment of the rotational principle altogether&rdquo; 
  (349), bears a slightly closer relationship with previous material than Hepokoski 
  assumes. As observed by him, &ldquo;the concluding portion of Rotation 8 (measures 205&ndash;20) 
  functions as a rhetorical (not a tonal) reprise of the whole of Rotation 1 [<nobr>. . .</nobr>]&rdquo; 
  (ibid.). Further, &ldquo;reprises in general, we might suppose, have a built-in drive 
  to continue&rdquo;; hence &ldquo;we might suppose that the reprise in Rotation 8 would lead 
  to the same figure at the onset of Rotation 9&rdquo; (ibid.) as that having occurred 
  in Rotation 2. And this, precisely, happens in a clearer manner than Hepokoski 
  observes. Whereas he points out a &ldquo;free <i>inversion</i>&rdquo; relationship between 
  the top voices in the passages in question, the entire material of the opening 
  phrase of Rotation 2 occurs in a slightly varied original form in the lower 
  strings in Rotation 9, as illustrated by the vertical alignment of these passages 
  in <b>Example 8</b>.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
  Moreover, the transpositional level of this material, the lower fifth, is the 
  same as in Rotation 8 in relation to 1; this enhances the sense in which Rotations 
  1&ndash;2 and 8&ndash;9 (or, to be precise, parts thereof) can be understood as 
  holding a &ldquo;macro-rotational&rdquo; relationship. All this is not to deny the merits 
  of Hepokoski&rsquo;s fresh formal view but to suggest that in the present case the 
  connection between the framing sections, on the one hand, and the contrast of 
  the central section, on the other, are slightly stronger than his rotational 
  conception might give us to understand.</p>
<p>[46] Finally it should be stated that the present review is not meant as a 
  balanced overview of <i>Sibelius Studies,</i> but as a commentary on its main 
  analytical and theoretical perspectives. In addition to such perspectives, those 
  interested in Sibelius will find discussion on topics such as semiotics, discography, 
  programmatic and biographic issues, incidental music, sketch studies, and metrical 
  revisions. And while the editors are to be criticized for how they have chosen 
  and weighted their analytical material, we may thank them for having compiled 
  this book in the first place to offer some kind of picture of the present state 
  of Sibelius research.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

The only&mdash;but certainly not sufficient&mdash;reason for such a reading I can think of is that the inner-voice theme introduced in measure 34 ff. is later, in different harmonic and metric circumstances, employed to establish the C minor (measure 133 ff.).</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">By a &ldquo;psychoacoustical basis,&rdquo; I refer to the 
  model of harmonic roots based on <i>virtual-pitch perception</i>; see, for example, 
  Richard Parncutt, &ldquo;Revision of Terhardt&rsquo;s Psychoacoustical Model of the Root(s) 
  of a Musical Chord,&rdquo; <i>Music Perception</i> 6 (1988): 65&ndash;94.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">This correspondence between large and small scale is observed 
  by Marston (<i>Schumann: Fantasie, Op. 17</i>; 54, Example 4.7). According to Marston 
  the connection goes on to the ascending notes D-E-F, for which I find 
  less justification.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Jackson&rsquo;s quotation, taken from Robert Layton&rsquo;s translation 
  of Erik Tawastsjerna&rsquo;s biography, reads actually &ldquo;the crystallization of ideas,&rdquo; 
  in plural. This seems to be a translation mistake since both the Finnish and 
  Swedish versions of the biography use singular.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Edward Laufer, &ldquo;On the First Movement of Sibelius&rsquo;s Fourth 
  Symphony. A Schenkerian View,&rdquo; in <i>Schenker Studies 2,</i> ed. Carl Schachter 
  and Hedi Siegel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 136&ndash;7.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Heinrich Schenker, <i>Free Composition</i> [1935], trans. Ernst Oster (New York: Schirmer Books, 1979), 27.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">For discussion on multikey schemes, see, for example, 
  William Kinderman and Harald Krebs (ed.), <i>The Second Practice of Nineteenth-Century Tonality</i> (Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1996).</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">For Schenker&rsquo;s graph of this prelude, see <i>Free Composition,</i> Fig. 110a:3.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Carl Schachter, <i>Unfoldings</i> (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), 260&ndash;88; see especially Example 11.4.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Free Composition,</i> Fig. 13.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Jackson goes so far as to call <i>The Wood Nymph</i> 
  &ldquo;a remarkable example of super-sonata form&rdquo; (215). I find it difficult to trace any sonata-form features with respect to either thematic disposition or harmonic structure.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Jackson shows E as the governing bass tone from measure 82 
  (I6) to measure 495 (III) (Example 8.30). As regards the significance of E, his intuitions 
  might be credited with being on the right track, even if the rationalization 
  of these intuitions in terms of prolongational superiority is totally misguided.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">This small-scale C-E&#x266d;-F-G bass line is 
  identical with the structural bass line that accompanies the <i>Urlinie</i> 
  descent from 5&#710; to 2&#710;, according to Laufer&rsquo;s analysis (Example 12.27, measures 343&ndash;449). 
  The connection is enhanced by the use of a Neapolitan sixth above F in both 
  cases. Laufer points out how the same harmony in measure 500 &ldquo;sums up what was heard before, in 446&ndash;448,&rdquo; i.e., above the structural F (Example 12.25), although the chord progression in measure 500 is actually familiar from measures 88, 148, 172, and 195.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Such techniques and their historical precedents are 
  discussed in greater detail in Laufer&rsquo;s previous essay &ldquo;On the First Movement 
  of Sibelius&rsquo;s Fourth Symphony.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">In the Seventh Symphony, too, there is an important 
  &ldquo;rotational&rdquo; relationship that partly involves an inner voice, between measures 34&ndash;59 and 64&ndash;91. In measures 34&ndash;45 and 64&ndash;75 the relationship becomes evident by comparing the voices of second violin and first horn, respectively. From measures 46 and 76 onwards it concerns the top or most prominent voice.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">For another representative example of recent Sibelius 
  research one may consult <i>Sibelius Forum: Proceedings from the Second International 
  Jean Sibelius Conference, Helsinki November 25&ndash;29, 1995,</i> ed. Veijo 
  Murtom&auml;ki, Kari Kilpel&auml;inen, and Risto V&auml;is&auml;nen (Helsinki: 
  Sibelius Academy, 1998). As regards discussion of the formal language in Sibelius&rsquo;s 
  symphonies, an indispensable source is Veijo Murtom&auml;ki, <i>Symphonic Unity: 
  The Development of Formal Thinking in the Symphonies of Sibelius,</i> Studia 
  Musicologica Universitatis Helsingiensis 5 (Helsinki: University of Helsinki, 
  1993).</div>
