<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Near the beginning of the tenth chapter of <i>Wagner Androgyne</i>
Jean-Jacques Nattiez introduces a quotation that he identifies as
coming from an obscure, unpublished lecture of Claude Levi-Strauss&mdash;a
lecture given in Brazil, and made available to Nattiez by a Brazilian
friend.  The passage is vintage Levi-Strauss: structuralist to a
fault, and using the paradigmatic method to identify an underlying
similarity of structure in two myths that seem, on the surface anyway,
to have nothing to do with one another.  What attracts Nattiez is that
the myths addressed by Levi-Strauss are in fact Wagnerian myths&mdash;those
of Siegfried and Tristan: My studies revealed the extensive
connections between all genuine myths and opened my eyes to the
marvelous variations that can be found within this rediscovered
corpus.  It was with a delightful sense of unmistakability that I
encountered one such variant in the relationship between Tristan and
Isolde as compared with that of Siegfried and Brunnhilde.  Just as in
languages, a sound shift often produces two apparently different words
from one and the same original, so two apparently differing
relationships had evolved from this single mythic relationship as a
result of a similar shift or transmutation (p. 237).  The paragraph
proceeds to detail the deep structural parallels between the two
myths, and Nattiez picks up the thread to adduce two comparable cases:
one that Levi-Strauss posits between <i>Die Meistersinger</i> and
<i>Parsifal</i> (&ldquo;In both cases an elderly and experienced man
. . . retires in favor of another, younger man, who is exceptionally
gifted and whom he enthrones. . . . &rdquo;), and Nattiez&rsquo;s own cherished
parallel between the &ldquo;androgyny&rdquo; in Wagner&rsquo;s theoretical writings and
that in his operas&mdash;the topic of the book.  These seductive structural
parallels serve to launch the main body of the chapter, in which
Nattiez 1) reviews the topic of androgyny in Levi-Strauss&rsquo;s work,
focusing especially on his provocative theory that, since the late
sixteenth century, music replaces myth in Western culture, and that it
functions on a sexual principle whereby [male] music fills up the
internal spaces of the [female] listener; 2) critiques Levi-Strauss&rsquo;s
structural analysis, in <i>The Naked Man,</i> of the <i>Ring</i>; and 3) allies
Levi-Strauss with Freud as twentieth-century theorists who purvey a
structuralist, totalizing hermeneutics. Such a hermeneutics, according
to Nattiez, &ldquo;reduce[s] the world&rsquo;s diversity to an endless series of
binary opposites,&rdquo; in the process obliterating the human subject,
denying time and historical process, and&mdash;most perniciously of
all&mdash;&ldquo;bolster[ing] up the liberty and laxity of interpretation&rdquo;
(p. 253), such that the binary opposites are reversed, male becomes
female, night becomes day, and (a leitmotif heard continually in the
long third part of the book) all meaning is lost in a &ldquo;total freedom
of interpretation&rdquo; (p. 263).
<p>

[2] Chapter Ten encapsulates in a nutshell the strengths and
weaknesses of Nattiez&rsquo;s book.  Nattiez&rsquo;s intellectual roots, of
course, are in French structuralism, and he shares with the best of
his models&mdash;of whom Levi-Strauss is certainly one&mdash;an imaginative and
wide-ranging mind, a polymathic command of sources in a dizzying
spectrum of disciplines, a penchant for close reading of texts, and a
flair for the &ldquo;paradigmatic method&rdquo; of discovering deep parallels that
are hidden beneath textual surfaces.  So it comes as no surprise that
in this chapter Nattiez navigates his way breezily among many of
Levi-Strauss&rsquo;s works, Wagner&rsquo;s writings, Wagner&rsquo;s operas, Ravel&rsquo;s
<i>Bolero</i> (as analyzed by Levi-Strauss), Freud and Jung, with passing
references to Paul Ricoeur, Roman Jakobson, Umberto Eco, a few
contemporaries of Freud, and a number of French critics thrown in for
good measure.  Nor does it come as a surprise that Nattiez has
discovered a structural parallel that really is worth knowing and
thinking about: that just as Wagner invented a powerful sexual
metaphor for the relation of text and music in opera (the text as
male, fertilizing with content and meaning the womb of music, which is
female), so did Levi-Strauss create a striking metaphor for the
communication of musical meaning, which resembles Wagner&rsquo;s in
intriguing ways.  But in the same way that structuralists (as pointed
out by Nattiez himself in this very chapter) often succumbed to the
temptation of collapsing the wildest differences into the flatness of
simple binary oppositions, which amass their great power in part
because they are sometimes defined so broadly as to be able to swallow
up everything in their path, so does Nattiez succeed in his task of
discovering &ldquo;androgyny&rdquo; to underlie both Wagner&rsquo;s prose writings and
his operas in part because he subsumes so much under the term that it
becomes virtually meaningless.  And Nattiez&rsquo;s attack on structuralist
interpretation, while perhaps justifiable in its own right, is just
one part of a gratuitous and curious polemic that weighs down the
entire last part of the book.
<p>

[3] Previous reviewers of Nattiez&rsquo;s study<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> have taken him to task
on his use of the concept &ldquo;androgyny,&rdquo; and they are right: it is
incumbent upon the author of a book entitled <i>Wagner Androgyne</i> to let
us know concisely what androgyny means.  Nattiez does not.  We can
read along happily for pages, thinking that we know, only to be jolted
out of our complacency by a new and unexplained usage just when we
have begun to congratulate ourselves on having finally figured it out.
Sadly, neither conventional usage nor logic is a major player in
Nattiez&rsquo;s formulation of the idea of androgyny.  Most of us probably
go into reading the book with the concept that androgyny involves
something that simultaneously bears characteristics of both sexes.
This intuition seems to be confirmed when Nattiez provides (in a
footnote of Chapter Five, however, not in the actual text) the crucial
distinction that he has &ldquo;reserved the term <i>androgyny</i> for the
<i>symbolic</i> representation of the union of the two sexes,&rdquo; while &ldquo;the
term <i>hermaphrodite</i> is used to describe a real <i>biological</i> being
with attributes of both sexes&rdquo; (footnote 13 on p. 328).  Fine:
androgyny is symbolic, but hermaphrodites are real.  But then, even if
we accept that the term refers to the world of symbol, not the real
one, Nattiez engenders utter confusion by employing <i>androgyny,</i>
contrary to conventional usage, to refer not only to the notion of a
single being that combines attributes of both sexes (like a
hermaphrodite, or like the Wagnerian or Jungian individual who
incorporates psychic aspects of both sexes), but to that of the union
of <i>two</i> separate and sexually differentiated individuals (like Adam
and Eve).  Thus, the sexual unions of Siegmund and Sieglinde,
Siegfried and Brunnhilde, and Tristan and Isolde all represent
instances of &ldquo;androgyny.&rdquo;  But if that&rsquo;s androgyny, one may well ask
what symbolic relation or union of the two sexes is <i>not</i> androgyny,
and to that question I was unable to find a convincing answer in
Nattiez&rsquo;s book.
<p>

[4] Compounding the confusion is a serious logical problem.  In the
light of the above description of androgyny as the &ldquo;symbolic
representation of the union of the two sexes,&rdquo; what do we do with a
statement that appears elsewhere in the book, to the effect that the
&ldquo;metaphor of androgyny&rdquo; &ldquo;seems to be based on a simple, universal
formula: X is to Y as man is to woman&rdquo; (p. 288)?  This formulation is
not about the union of characteristics into a single entity at all,
but about a relationship of characteristics themselves.  Neither in
the symbolic world nor the real one should we have to deal with a word
that means <i>both</i> the combination of two contrasting terms into one,
<i>and</i> the relationship of the two terms to each other. (If x/y = x +
y, the only solutions are everything and nothing.)
<p>

[5] Central though this terminological morass is to the book and its
argument, and irritating though it be, it is not fatal.  My advice to
the reader: go with whatever definition of &ldquo;androgyny&rdquo; seems to work
at the time, and don&rsquo;t worry about it.  Once one grants wide berth to
androgyny, and in fact begins to realize that the real point is that
sexual metaphors dominate Wagner&rsquo;s stage and prose works, and that
there are powerful and intriguing connections between the two, one
finds much of worth to ponder.  To be sure, there are frustrations:
Nattiez often ranges far from the topic at hand, he obscures his
argument with unnecessary detail, and in the third and final part of
the book he appropriates his notion of Wagnerian androgyny in the
service of a political polemic that in my view detracts from rather
than contributes to the effectiveness of his study.  But he does
provide a detailed and well-researched overview of Wagner&rsquo;s changing
use of sexualized metaphors in his conceptualization of his own art
and that of his predecessors, and his linking of these metaphors in
the prose works to the stage works does offer a new and valuable
critical perspective.
<p>

[6] The question that motivates the book is, &ldquo;What is the significance
of androgyny in Wagner&rsquo;s works and theoretical writings when seen in
the context of the texts, the composer&rsquo;s life, and the age in which he
lived?&rdquo; (Preface, xiv&ndash;xv).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>This question leads to two theses, which
it is the task of the book to prove.  The first is &ldquo;that the myth
around which the <i>Ring</i> revolves may be read as a metaphorical
reenactment of Wagner&rsquo;s conception of the history of music&rdquo; (Preface,
xv)&mdash;a history in which the sexualized metaphor of male text and
female music plays a central role.  The second is &ldquo;that throughout his
life, Wagner&rsquo;s theory of the relationship between poetry and music is
reflected, in his music dramas, in the relations between man and
woman&rdquo; (Preface, xv).  It is these two theses that generate the first
two parts of the book: &ldquo;Androgyny and the <i>Ring</i>: From Theory to
Practice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Music and Poetry: The Metamorphoses of Wagnerian
Androgyny.&rdquo;
<p>

[7] Part One (Chapters 1&ndash;5) posits androgyny as a theme that links
Wagner&rsquo;s writings from 1848 to 1851&mdash;that is, those from around the
time of the early gestation of the text of <i>Ring</i>&mdash;to the <i>Ring</i>
itself.  Nattiez&rsquo;s argument here, in brief, is as follows.  For the
Wagner of <i>Opera and Drama,</i> the history of musical drama, from the
time of the ancient Greeks to his own time, proceeds from 1) an
original (androgynous) unity of poetry and music, to 2) a division of
the two, either into spoken drama and absolute music, or&mdash;what is
worse&mdash;a mismatch of drama and music in Italian opera and the
detestable &ldquo;modern opera&rdquo; of Meyerbeer, and 3) a yet-to-be-realized
creative union, in the perfect musico-dramatic work of the future, of
(male) poetry and (female) music, with the poetic or dramatic element
dominating the musical one.  Similarly, in the <i>Ring</i> there is a
progression from 1) an original (androgynous) state of
nature&mdash;represented by the three Rheindaughters, who, though all
female, embody the unity of the sister arts of music, poetry, and
dance (a natural state of affairs that, according to Wagner, prevailed
in Greek tragedy; to 2) a period of rupture (&ldquo;unity&rdquo; is destroyed by
Alberich&rsquo;s theft of the gold, and later Siegfried must forge the
shards of the sword together), in which Nattiez is quick to find
parallels between the mythic Alberich and Mime, on the one hand, and
the historical Meyerbeer, on the other; to 3) the triumphant union of
Siegfried and Brunnhilde at the end of Act III of <i>Siegfried</i>.  Since,
in the final scene of that act, Siegfried and Brunnhilde merge into
one, each taking on characteristics of the opposite sex (&ldquo;the true
human being is both male and female,&rdquo; Wagner wrote to August Rockel in
1852), Nattiez interprets their union as embodying symbolically the
bringing together the male poet and the female musician&mdash;but with the
poet, or Siegfried with his sword, dominant&mdash;into an artistic whole
that transcends &ldquo;modern opera&rdquo; and that restores the androgynous unity
of the beginning of the cycle&mdash;and, one presumes, of the beginning of
history as well.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The tragic <i>Gotterdammerung</i> then demonstrates the
inherent instability of such an androgynous union.  Siegfried is
seduced by Gutrune, who in his view represents the corrupt modern
French comic opera; he betrays Brunnhilde and thus the unity of music
and poetry achieved at the end of <i>Siegfried,</i> and the cycle ends in
catastrophe.
<p>

[8] Part Two (Chapters 6&ndash;7) of the book turns on the same imagery, but
carries the story to the end of Wagner&rsquo;s life by drawing similar
parallels between the composer&rsquo;s writings between 1851 and 1873
(especially &ldquo;Zukunftsmusik&rdquo; of 1860, and &ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo; of 1870) and
<i>Tristan,</i> and between his latest essays (between 1878 and 1883) and
<i>Parsifal.</i> In his discussion of the middle period (Chapter 6,
1851&ndash;1873), Nattiez admits that the sexual imagery of <i>Opera and
Drama</i> disappears.  Yet the power relations inscribed in the earlier
works remain, although they are now inverted so that it is the
musician, not the poet, who calls the shots&mdash;perhaps, according to
Nattiez, because Wagner&rsquo;s experience in composing the music of the
<i>Ring</i> (through Act II of <i>Siegfried</i>) in the 1850&rsquo;s might have taught
him how much his text was conditioned by music from the start,
regardless of what he had claimed in theory.  In <i>Tristan</i> this shift
is incarnated not only in the way the music dominates the text, but
also in the fact that it is Isolde, representing music, who takes the
lead in the drama: it is she who insists on meeting with Tristan, who
invites him to her quarters, who orders the potion to be prepared, who
arranges the tryst in Act II, and so forth.  Finally, in the essays
written in the years of working on <i>Parsifal</i> (discussed in Nattiez&rsquo;s
Chapter 7), Wagner returns to his earlier sexual metaphor: &ldquo;. . . as I
have explained in figurative terms elsewhere, the poet&rsquo;s task can be
described as the male principle, while the music, by contrast, is the
female principle in a union that aims to create the greatest synthesis
of the arts. . .  .&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Yet, as in the <i>Tristan</i> period, it is the
musician who is in charge: &ldquo;It was no longer the poet who was left to
structure the tragedy but the lyric musician.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> But here Nattiez
seems to be at a loss as to how to explain this turn in the
theoretical writings to the opera <i>Parsifal.</i> The sexual metaphor is
only weakly present in the late essays.  Furthermore, there is no
question of a one-to-one mapping of Wagner&rsquo;s history of music and the
events of the drama, as there was in the <i>Ring</i>; nor is there an
obvious dramatic parallel between the relation of drama and music and
the relation of male and female characters, as there was in
<i>Tristan</i>&mdash;Kundry is hardly the dominant figure in the opera in
comparison to Parsifal.  So Nattiez ends up abandoning the analogy
(between Wagner&rsquo;s theories and his works) that has guided the book
thus far (though he does not explicitly say that he is doing so), and
sees in <i>Parsifal</i> what amounts to an <i>Aufhebung</i> of androgyny to the
level of culture itself.  For what Nattiez sees in <i>Parsifal</i> is a
Wagnerian androgyny that leaves poetry and music behind, and instead
implants itself in the content of the opera: an androgyny that does
not represent a union of the two sexes, as in the <i>Ring</i> and
<i>Tristan,</i> but, in the spirit of Wagner&rsquo;s late misogynist and racist
writings, &ldquo;proclaims the advent of a raceless, sexless society&rdquo;
(p. 172), in which racial and sexual differences are transcended, once
and for all.
<p>

[9] Nattiez deserves high praise for his careful reading of Wagner&rsquo;s
writings, especially those of the 1848&ndash;51 period, and for his
imaginative reading of the <i>Ring</i> in the light of both the sexualized
metaphors of the theoretical works and of Wagner&rsquo;s own life
experience.  To cite a single example: Nattiez devotes a short chapter
to the 1850 scenario, <i>Wieland der Schmied,</i> briefly intended for the
Paris Opera, but never set to music.  He draws convincing parallels,
on the one hand, between the dramatic situation in <i>Wieland</i> and
Wagner and his writings, and on the other, between <i>Wieland</i> and
<i>Siegfried</i>.  The male artisan-poet (Wieland), crippled and tormented
by a greedy oppressor (Neiding), but driven on by his Need (Noth) and
inspired by the swan-maiden who is to be his wife, invents something
utterly new (wings) and thus flies aloft to be with his bride, after
which he exacts deadly vengeance on Neiding and his court.  As Nattiez
suggests, it is difficult not to see here a confluence of the real
Wagner, oppressed in Paris (in his own view) by Meyerbeer, and his
theoretical musings about the male poet and the female musician, all
wrapped into a single (and, it must be admitted, crudely
autobiographical) dramatic scenario.  The same formula is imported
into <i>Siegfried,</i> where Siegfried, Mime, Brunnhilde, &ldquo;Noth,&rdquo; and the
sword play the same roles as Wieland, Neiding, Schwanhilde, &ldquo;Noth,&rdquo;
and the wings.  Nattiez&rsquo;s thesis that the <i>Ring</i> is a metaphorical
reenactment of the history of music (a la Wagner) thus makes certain
aspects of <i>Siegfried</i> begin to make more sense, although their
autobiographical resonance now makes them seem&mdash;to me, at least&mdash;even
more odious than before: the thinly veiled anti-Semitic caricature of
Mime, the violence of Siegfried&rsquo;s forging of the sword, and his murder
of Mime.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup><p>[10] At the same time, there are aspects of Nattiez&rsquo;s interpretation
of the <i>Ring</i> that simply do not compute.  To understand the
Rhinedaughters as metaphorical depictions of poetry, music, and dance;
the original state of the world as involving the unity of these three
arts; Alberich, Mime and Hagen as embodiments of all that was to
Wagner reprehensible in 1830&rsquo;s and 1840&rsquo;s opera; Siegfried&rsquo;s forging
of the sword as a triumphant act of creativity; his vanquishing of
Mime as the victory of his brand of opera over that of Meyerbeer; and
his union with Brunnhilde as the establishment of the new artistic
order&mdash;all this is plausible, and deftly argued.  But such an
interpretation leaves out enormous chunks of the <i>Ring,</i> and leaves us
with many nagging questions.  What do we do with Wotan, who is hardly
even mentioned, or with Siegmund and Sieglinde?  What do we do with
the central dramatic motif of Wotan&rsquo;s renunciation of power?  If
Siegfried represents poetry and Brunnhilde music, why is Siegfried so
stupid and inarticulate, and why does Brunnhilde have to take years to
teach him her runic wisdom (which, one presumes, is in &ldquo;male&rdquo; spoken
language, not the &ldquo;female&rdquo; language of &ldquo;pure feeling,&rdquo; or music)?  And
does it make sense to turn Gutrune, who supposedly seduces Siegfried
with the wiles of vapid French comic opera, into perhaps the central
character of Gotterdammerung, rather than seeing her as a pathetic
dupe whose worst sin is merely passive collusion in an evil plot?
These are serious questions that I have as yet been unable to answer
to my own satisfaction.  At the same time, much of Nattiez&rsquo;s virtuosic
tying together of Wagner&rsquo;s theories and the drama seems intuitively
right.  His interpretation is already deeply embedded in my own
reception history of the <i>Ring,</i> and it has woven a rich new strand
into my experience of the cycle.
<p>

[11] Nattiez is unable to bring together theory and drama quite so
closely in Part Two of the book, simply because Wagner retreated from
his sexualized metaphor after the writings of the early 1850&rsquo;s.  But
there is nevertheless much of value here.  Chapter Five, &ldquo;Wagnerian
Androgyny and Its Romantic Counterpart,&rdquo; is one of the strongest
chapters in the book.  Always the scholar, Nattiez reconstructs a
whole literature on androgyny from the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries, from works on art history, medicine, philosophy
and theology, as well as fiction and poetry.  Much of this literature
envisions a new social order based on either the equality of the sexes
or the transcendence of sexual difference: for example, Schlegel&rsquo;s
comment in the essay &ldquo;Uber die diotima&rdquo; of 1795 that &ldquo;The goal to
which the human race should aspire is the progressive reintegration of
the sexes&rdquo; (quoted on p. 114), or the well-known love-and-death
imagery of Novalis (p. 116).  A sampling of such writing places
Wagner&rsquo;s sexualized language in a broader cultural context, and it
strengthens Nattiez&rsquo;s argument that the notion of overcoming sexual
difference, if not actual androgyny, is central to the <i>Ring,</i>
<i>Tristan,</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>.  And if his readings of <i>Tristan</i> and
<i>Parsifal</i> seem somewhat contrived, since their relation to theory is
murkier, they nevertheless round out his narrative of the relation of
Wagner&rsquo;s theory and art by offering many new insights.
<p>

[12] By the end of Part Two, Nattiez has pursued the theme of
&ldquo;androgyny&rdquo; in Wagner&rsquo;s writings and operas from 1848 to his death,
and he has argued his two principal theses in detail.  So the book
should be over, should it not?  Yet such is hardly the case: its
longest and most substantial part&mdash;fully 40 percent of the total
length&mdash;still remains.  Why?  The purpose of this extended Part Three,
&ldquo;Wagner and Androgynous Hermeneutics,&rdquo; which includes five chapters
and an Epilogue, is not clear in the Preface, and it only gradually
makes itself apparent as one reads it.  At first it seems as though
the final, longish section is borne of a certain defensiveness on
Nattiez&rsquo;s part that his &ldquo;historico-genetic approach&rdquo; in Parts I and
II might be deemed insufficient; indeed, he indicates as much at the
end of Part II (p. 178): suppose that &ldquo;factual evidence and explicit
statements&rdquo; are not enough?  Suppose that, dealing as he does with
androgyny and myth, someone demands that he take into account the
workings of the unconscious?
<p>

[13] Ostensibly to head off such criticism, he launches into a
full-blown Freudian analysis of Wagner and his family&mdash;an analysis
that, it must be admitted, creates a yawning chasm between Parts Two
and Three, and leaves the reader to his or her own devices as to
figuring out how this discussion and the chapters that follow will
relate to what has been said so far.  But what gradually emerges in
these chapters is not merely a methodological defensiveness.  It is in
fact a full-fledged claim on the part of Nattiez of an objective
validity, and demonstrable truth value for his &ldquo;philological,
historico-genetic method&rdquo; of interpretation.  Against the factual
security of his own method he sees the interpretive systems that he
examines in successive chapters of Part Three&mdash;Freudian psychology in
Chapter Eight, Jungian psychology in Chapter Nine, Levi-Straussian
structuralism in Chapter Ten, Marxist theory in Chapter Eleven, and
post-structuralism and deconstruction in Chapter Twelve&mdash;as denying
the possibility of such objective validity.  The baleful refrain that
underlies all these chapters is&mdash;and here I cite Nattiez&rsquo;s
condemnation of Roland Barthes, although he says essentially the same
thing about most of the writers that he evaluates: &ldquo;there is no longer
a hierarchy of value or validity between the commentaries on a text:
<i>one can say whatever one wants</i>&rdquo; (p. 264; emphasis mine).  Or compare
his dismissal of Freud: &ldquo;Freudian exegesis provided the paradigm for
later hermeneutics, all of which maintains that they can &lsquo;establish&rsquo;
that what is said is what is not said, and that I say the opposite of
what I say.  When I love my mother, I hate my father, but at the same
time as hating him, I love him because, being a man, I am also a
woman&rdquo; (pp. 217&ndash;18).
<p>

[14] And what is the ultimate foundation of all this &ldquo;freedom of
interpretation&rdquo;?  Who would have guessed?  It is nothing other than
<i>androgyny</i> itself.  It is &ldquo;sexual ambivalence&rdquo;: &ldquo;There is femininity
in masculinity, and masculinity in femininity.  When I say &lsquo;white,&rsquo; I
mean &lsquo;black&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 217).  It is an &ldquo;ideological grounding in androgyny&rdquo;
(p. 217) that leads Nattiez to consign not only Freud, but also Jung,
Levi-Strauss, contemporary Marxists, Barthes, and Derrida,
structuralists and post-structuralists, totalizers and anti-totalizers alike, all to the trash-heap of interpreters who claim that
&ldquo;One can certainly say what one wants&rdquo; (p. 266).
<p>

[15] At this point the reader cannot help but feeling betrayed.
(&ldquo;Verrat!&rdquo; shrieks Brunnhilde upon seeing Siegfried in Gunther&rsquo;s
form.)  Throughout Parts One and Two, we are encouraged to believe in
androgyny, to see it as the glue that ties together the theoretical
and artistic halves of the Wagnerian oeuvre, to understand it as a
social and philosophical, even theological symbol that has deep roots
in Western culture.  Certainly Wagner himself was invested in the
nineteenth-century philosophy that found the highest ethical value in
transcending sexual difference.  Then without warning, without even a
hint of what is to come, as we cross the threshhold of the twentieth
century, we gradually discover that androgyny is the great villain of
our time, the root of all interpretive evil.
<p>

[16] The ploy has the same effect as Nattiez&rsquo;s use of the Levi-Strauss
quotation cited at the beginning of this review.  For we as readers
learn, at the very end of the chapter on Levi-Strauss, that this
quotation is not by the anthropologist at all, but by Wagner!  The
reason for this deception, according to Nattiez, is that it was the
most eloquent possible way &ldquo;of showing that Wagner was not a precursor
of structuralism but that Levi-Strauss is a late Romantic&rdquo; (p. 253).
For subjecting us to this clever ruse Nattiez asks our forgiveness,
and I, for one, happily grant it.  But I am more concerned when I
experience a similar ploy&mdash;and one that is surely not intentional on
the part of the author&mdash;on the global scale of the book: the voice
that I thought I was reading transforms into another voice entirely.
The voice that stakes its claim for meaning, value and validity in
Parts One and Two does so by demonstrating androgyny in the works of
Wagner.  But this voice turns, without ever saying so, into a voice
that condemns androgyny by positing it as the intellectual foundation
of all interpretive strategies that putatively destroy meaning, value,
and validity altogether.  Nattiez thus calls his own voice into
question and leaves the reader wondering which voice to trust.  All
would be well if he were to address this <i>volte face</i> straight on, and
suggest explicitly that what was a powerful symbol in the nineteenth
century has been subverted and turned to what he sees as destructive
ends in the twentieth century.  But his failure to do so forces us as
readers to make the switch ourselves, and it ultimately leaves us
without a stable authorial voice upon which we can rely.  In the
process, we wonder also whether Nattiez&rsquo;s dogged defense of the
&ldquo;objective truth&rdquo; that he has revealed, as well as his endless attacks
on freedom of interpretation, might in fact undermine his whole
ongoing semiotic project, which has always relied on a certain
fluidity of signifier and signified to make its way in the world.</p>
