distinctions that constitute both the strength and limitation of
Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Formenlehre</i>, but also to fasten them securely to the
music of his protagonists: a challenging project that Caplin handles
with disquieting aplomb.  His demonstration of terminological reform
and analytical precision constitutes a noble effort, and despite the

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] William Caplin&rsquo;s new book startles by 
declaring that &ldquo;the time is
ripe for a new theory of classical music&rdquo; (page 3), and surprises even
more by its choice of models on which to build: rather than starting
from scratch or adapting more recent critical, historical, and
analytical research by Charles Rosen, Leonard Ratner, Jan LaRue, and
others, Caplin looks back to the <i>Formenlehre</i> tradition promulgated
by Arnold Schoenberg<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> and his pupil Erwin Ratz.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[2] Progressing from small dimensions to large, and from simple
structures to complex, the older discipline attempts to specify the
structure and deployment of formal functions in standard instrumental
movement-types.  Elements examined include the motive, the phrase, and
the relationships among phrases within archetypal sentences and
periods.  Small forms are categorized, and theoretical models are
provided for the allocation of theme-types, including main theme,
transition, and subordinate group, for rondo, sonata, and other
large-scale designs.  Fully aware of current scholarly disdain for the
ennui of pigeonholing, Caplin nevertheless sees the potential of
<i>Formenlehre</i>, when suitably modified, for addressing present-day
theoretical and analytical concerns.
<p>

[3] He adapts the method first of all by limiting the chronological
span to be encompassed.  In contrast to Schoenberg, whose rules and
functional categories applied to a broad historical spectrum,
extending at least from Bach to Brahms, Caplin restricts his study to
the high-classical repertory: sonatas, trios, quartets, quintets,
overtures, concertos, and symphonies composed by Haydn, Mozart, and
Beethoven in the years 1780&ndash;1810.  He then proposes a vast elaboration
of Schoenberg&rsquo;s categories in an effort to accommodate compositional
diversity without losing the theoretical appeal of plausible
generalization.  Embarking on this route, he aims to show how
instrumental music by the great classical masters does indeed
exemplify certain formal archetypes, and that a methodical dissection
of the archetypes can furnish suitable tools both for analyzing
specific compositions and for drawing historically useful conclusions
about style.  He thus invites us to ponder afresh the paradox by which
the classical masters seemed bent on undermining and transforming
formal conventions, even while celebrating their enduring currency.
<p>

[4] As Caplin leads us through a bewildering array of hybrids,
fusions, transformations, framing and medial functions, failed
consequents, post-cadentials, interpolations, expansions, and
extensions, an odd disparity becomes apparent between the homely (but
functionally precise) terminology and the musical elegance it
describes.  His anatomy of development sections, for example, isolates
such curiosities as transitional introductions, initiating regions,
sequenced models, cores, pre-cores, core substitutes, pseudo-cores,
and false recapitulations.  In trying to comprehend all these
subcategories, alternatives, and deviations, the reader is assisted by
the clear organization of the text, the detailed explanations and
commentaries on illustrative examples, and a helpful glossary that
gives thumbnail definitions for many terms with their special,
form-functional connotations.  Additional help comes from the splendid
bibliography, a selective but wide-ranging list of books and articles
dealing with theory, analysis, and stylistic criticism pertinent to
late 18th- and early 19th-century music.
<p>

[5] An ingeniously compact format permits inclusion of an
extraordinary wealth of music examples: each occupies a single staff,
with novel and copious use of divided stems and octave transposition
signs to maximize the representation of separate parts and minimize
the use of leger lines.  (Readers who wish to study the examples in
detail will nevertheless want to have full-size scores at hand: in
excerpts that involve textural complexity, much is inevitably lost,
and while most of the notation signs are easily legible, the bar
numbers are so small and fine that readers with even mild visual
impairment may find themselves groping for a magnifying glass.)
<p>

[6] Since Caplin aims to direct our attention to functional
categories, and not to the inspirations and idiosyncrasies of his
protagonists <i>per se</i>, it would appear that we are dealing with norms,
customs, and rates of occurrence.  But perhaps sensing that a frankly
quantitative approach might lean too far in the direction of style
description rather than theory, he proposes that his categories
&ldquo;represent abstractions based on generalized compositional tendencies
in the classical repertory.  A category is not necessarily meant to
reflect frequency of occurrence in a statistical sense: it is often
the case that relatively few instances in the repertory correspond
identically to the complete definition of a given category&rdquo; (page 4).
But by choosing a specific repertory and probing it in close detail,
his inquiry inevitably becomes enmeshed with style criticism&mdash;and with
style criticism&rsquo;s shadowy companion, statistics.  At one point, he
actually does resort to numbers, telling us that about 10 percent of
classical minuets resemble small binary (page 220).  Elsewhere, he
relies on an abundance of adverbs, including &ldquo;mostly,&rdquo; &ldquo;rarely,&rdquo;
&ldquo;commonly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;frequently,&rdquo; to give an idea of how often certain
functions, patterns, and relationships occur.  Given the author&rsquo;s
comprehensive knowledge of the music in question, readers may
sometimes wish for more use of numbers.  For example, we read that
&ldquo;frequently<nobr>. . .</nobr>the composer adds a <i>coda</i>&rdquo; (page 179), that &ldquo;sometimes
the notation indicates that the coda starts after the double bar lines
that instruct the performer to repeat the development and
recapitulation together&rdquo; (page 181), and that &ldquo;on occasion, a genuine
coda is included in the repeat of the development and recapitulation&rdquo;
(page 278, note 8).  &ldquo;Frequently&rdquo; tells us that codas are common, while
&ldquo;sometimes&rdquo; and &ldquo;on occasion&rdquo; indicate the modest size of specified
subcategories within the total number; but this leaves us with the
queasy sense that a majority of instances have been left unaccounted
for.  True, we can infer a relatively large number of codas in
movements where there are no repeat signs for the latter part of the
movement, but this subcategory is never identified as such.
<p>

[7] Coaxing &ldquo;abstractions based on generalized compositional
tendencies&rdquo; from a collection of masterworks famously packed with
novelty is clearly an endeavor fraught with perils, and Caplin usually
succeeds in facing them with chilling equanimity.  Following his
predecessors&rsquo; example, he places heavy emphasis on harmony as primary
determinant of form.  Lest there be any doubt, the very opening words
of this book proclaim loudly, in 16-point type, Schoenberg&rsquo;s triad of
admonitions from <i>Fundamentals</i>: &ldquo;Watch the harmony; watch the root
progressions; watch the bass line&rdquo; (page 2).
<p>

[8] The preoccupation with harmony promotes theoretical stability, but
it can also limit our analytical purview if it downplays the often
prominent role of other elements, including register, dynamics,
timbre, surface rhythm, and melodic profile.  Thus Caplin&rsquo;s broad
distinction between &ldquo;main theme&rdquo; and &ldquo;subordinate theme&rdquo; specifies a
tonal hierarchy unequivocally&mdash;a subordinate theme is that which
occurs in the subordinate key&mdash;but it implies exclusion of the
possibility that a movement might assign more than subordinate
emphasis (on grounds other than tonality) to an exposition theme
stated in the dominant or relative major key.
<p>

[9] More specifically troublesome is Caplin&rsquo;s elaboration of
distinctions drawn by Schoenberg and Ratz between tight-knit and loose
organization.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>  
Caplin observes that &ldquo;in the classical repertory,
subordinate themes are, with rare exceptions, more loosely organized
than their preceding main themes&rdquo; (page 97).  This makes sense from the
vantage point of Caplin&rsquo;s method, which typically labels as
&ldquo;subordinate theme&rdquo; not only a (possibly tight-knit) contrasting
period with its own special consistencies of timbre, dynamics, surface
rhythm, and register, but also a diversity of more loosely organized,
anticipatory or summarizing functions preceding and following such a
theme.  Caplin&rsquo;s allowances for exceptions and alternatives
notwithstanding, the broad &ldquo;subordinate theme&rdquo; category tends to
swallow up potentially important distinctions, for example the not
unfamiliar option of contrasting an open-ended, expansive primary
theme with a stabilizing, closed period in the second key (exemplified
in the first movements of Mozart&rsquo;s Piano Concerto in D minor, K. 466,
and Haydn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reiter&rdquo; Quartet, Op. 74/3).
<p>

[10] Also likely to be swallowed up by Caplin&rsquo;s rather strictly
defined categories are the processes of gradual transition and
secondary-theme solidification that often characterize classical
expositions.  In Mozart&rsquo;s Piano Sonata in D, K. 576, first movement, a
half cadence in bar 27 places us on a dominant plateau, lifting the
music from its tonic underpinnings but scarcely confirming arrival in
the new key.  The open-ended, sequential figuration that follows,
featuring a virtually unbroken stream of sixteenth notes (bars 33&ndash;40),
climaxes in a trilled cadential flourish, followed by a marked
contrast of register that emphasizes the sense of a fresh, contrasting
theme in the new key at bar 42.  But this is not where Caplin begins
the subordinate theme group.  Rather, he places it at bar 28.  Because
the thematic statement of bars 28&ndash;41 closes with a full cadence in the
dominant, Caplin&rsquo;s theory requires him to designate it as a
subordinate theme.  Thus the emphatic punctuation in bar 41, no matter
how salient rhetorically, merely marks an interior divide within a
larger subordinate group.
<p>

[11] Not surprisingly, Mozart deletes the material of bars 28&ndash;41 from
the recapitulation, where establishment of a new key is no longer an
issue.  Now, with simple and impeccable logic, the recurrence of the
half cadence from bar 27 serves to prepare the contrasting theme first
heard at bar 42.  But since Caplin&rsquo;s theory commits him to designating
bars 28&ndash;41 as a first subordinate theme, not merely a dispensable
transition, he finds himself explaining the omission in relatively
complicated terms: &ldquo;Mozart begins the subordinate theme of the
recapitulation with material from the <i>second</i> subordinate theme of
the exposition<nobr>. . .</nobr> He does so presumably to avoid a redundant
appearance of the main theme&rsquo;s basic idea in the home key, which would
arise from using the first subordinate theme&rdquo; (page 169).
<p>

[12] We confront a similar dilemma in an analysis of Mozart&rsquo;s Violin
Concerto in A, K. 219, first movement.  Here, the problematical
passage spans measures 74&ndash;80 in the solo exposition.  Appearing after
a half cadence in the tonic key, and leading to a half cadence in the
dominant, this lightly scored material can readily be heard as an
introductory gesture, preparing the featured subordinate-theme entry
on the upbeat to bar 81.  But Caplin&rsquo;s theory obliges him to disagree:
&ldquo;Following traditional notions of form, some analysts might see the
true &lsquo;second subject&rsquo; as beginning in measure 81 because of the
catchier tune and because that idea was also found in the opening
ritornello (measure 20).  But this view ignores the fact that measures 74&ndash;80 reside entirely in the new key.  Thus for tonal reasons, as well as
phrase-structural ones, this passage is consistent with the
definition of a subordinate theme (first part) and should not be
regarded as belonging to the transition&rdquo; (page 117).
<p>

[13] While rejecting the idea of beginning the second-theme function
at bar 81, he acknowledges that this material was indeed announced in
the opening ritornello.  What he omits noting is how that initial
appearance of the theme was marked for emphasis: it designated a point
of decisive contrast in register, dynamics, texture, and surface
rhythm, where the punctuating rest&mdash;actually the only strong-beat rest
in the entire movement&mdash;occurred at virtually the exact midpoint of
the ritornello; thus there seems little doubt as to the role of this
event in signaling a major landmark in the design.  To be sure, bars
74&ndash;80 soften the abrupt contrast experienced in the ritornello, but
nonetheless it seems easier to hear bar 81 as a major structural
articulation than as merely the start of &ldquo;a second part to this
subordinate theme&rdquo; begun in bar 74.
<p>

[14] In contrast to the two examples cited above, where clearly marked
cadences guided Caplin&rsquo;s choice (perhaps too unequivocally) of where
to place the &ldquo;subordinate theme&rdquo; label, expositions whose cadences are
less well defined may lead to uncertainty about thematic punctuation.
In describing the notoriously ambiguous exposition of Haydn&rsquo;s String
Quartet in B minor, Op. 64/2, first movement, Caplin states that &ldquo;the
beginning of this subordinate theme is especially difficult to
determine because little in the way of any rhythmic, textural, or
dynamic change helps articulate the boundary between the transition
and the subordinate theme.  After the transition arrives on the
dominant of the subordinate key (downbeat of measure 15), a new melodic
idea, featuring a chromatic stepwise descent, prolongs the half
cadence by means of another half-cadential progression&rdquo; (page 114).  In
a note to the passage, he observes that &ldquo;an additional difficulty
arises from the question of whether each real measure equals a notated
measure or one-half a notated measure&rdquo; (page 272, note 53).
<p>

[15] To begin with, the movement in question exemplifies the so-called
compound <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> measure, frequently encountered in later 18th-century chamber music, in which the metrical impulse is virtually that of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> with every other bar line removed.  Thus the fact that a theme begins in the middle of a notated measure should not, in and of itself, cause
confusion.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Moreover, Haydn marks the entry of the new theme with a change of register in the cello, which leaps up a tenth on the
upbeat to beat 3 (i.e., the midbar downbeat).  Arguably, in the
context of an exceptionally subtle and tonally unsettled exposition,
the signals are outstandingly clear at this point: a contrasting
melodic figure in the first violin and a register shift in the cello
confirm the thematic articulation, while other elements lend
continuity and reinforce persisting harmonic tension.  The harmony may
be unsettled, but the location of the new theme&rsquo;s beginning seems
nonetheless unambiguous.
<p>

[16] The somewhat disgruntled response of Caplin&rsquo;s theory to the Haydn
movement cited above seems at least partially a reaction to the work&rsquo;s
undermining an element on which the method depends: a point of
unambiguous functional contrast between transition and subordinate
theme.  But it may also be symptomatic of a tendency to substitute the
archetype for the music in question as the point of reference for
analytical discussion: the music, not fitting the archetype very well,
is judged to be more problematic than it might if viewed in terms of
its own environment of expectations and functional nuances.
<p>

[17] Absorption with the archetype is most clearly evident in Caplin&rsquo;s
treatment of the form he labels <i>sonata without development</i>.  &ldquo;If a
development is eliminated, then the section following the exposition
will seem to function more as a <i>repetition</i> than a return.  Indeed,
the listener hearing the movement for the &lsquo;first time&rsquo; would not
necessarily know that the appearance of the main theme following the
exposition marks the beginning of a recapitulation (of a sonata
without development) and could just as likely believe that the
exposition is simply being repeated according to the norms of sonata
form&rdquo; (page 216).
<p>

[18] This statement seems reasonable in the abstract: the archetypal
exposition closes with a full cadence, and the ensuing recurrence of
the main theme in tonic could therefore signal the start of either a
recapitulation or a repeated exposition.  But the list of examples
that Caplin cites includes few movements that resemble the archetype
closely enough to illustrate the ambivalence.  For example, in the
slow movement of Mozart&rsquo;s String Quartet in C, K. 465, the cadence
marking the end of the exposition (bar 39) elides with an intense,
six-measure transition whose rising melodic line, motivic repetitions,
sustained crescendo, and prolonged harmonic tension leave no doubt as
to its function in anticipating a major landmark&mdash;the
recapitulation&mdash;much as we would expect from a retransition after a
development section.  Two of Caplin&rsquo;s examples from Haydn&rsquo;s quartets
stand even further removed from the model: the second movement of
Op. 76/4 prohibits any confusion by turning unexpectedly from major to
minor in the first measure of the recapitulation; and the second
movement of Op. 50/2 appropriates a design familiar from 18th-century
operatic practice: ritornello-like passages at the beginning, middle,
and end of the movement frame the two main sections (analogous to
exposition and recapitulation), each conceived as an embellished
violin solo that culminates in a cadential trill.  At no time does the
possibility of a repeated exposition come into question.
<p>

[19] Attesting to the scholarly energy that Caplin has bestowed on
this project, an almost overwhelming extravagance of notes accompanies
the text&mdash;not footnotes, alas, placed in easy viewing range at the
bottom of the page, but endnotes, stuffed in the back of the book.
Many consist of bibliographical citations, others offer supplementary
commentary, and still others list compositions that exemplify
functional categories described in the text.  Since there are close to
750 of these notes, for less than 250 pages of text, encountering them
is a common event on virtually every page, and thus a constant
interruption.  Fearful of missing something essential, the reader must
stop, reach for a bookmark, then begin clawing through the back of the
book.  Given the irritating necessity of endnote format, it might have
been good to incorporate the lists of supplementary examples, and
perhaps much of the illuminating commentary, in the text proper.
<p>

[20] But ferreting out the notes is a minor annoyance, measured
against the value of this book as a clear and uniquely detailed
presentation of standard forms and their constituent parts, a
compilation of intriguing examples illustrating classical design and
function, an up-to-date bibliographical guide, and a source of fresh
insight into the accomplishments of the classical masters.  Caplin&rsquo;s
approach, buttressed by methodological rigor and theoretical detail,
makes a persuasive case for the revival of <i>Formenlehre</i> as a
pedagogical tool and analytical discipline; but it also underscores
the limitations of a method that sometimes enforces Procrustean
choices on music that may use convention as much for nuance and
ambiguity as for conformity to functional norms.</p>
