<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] This month sees the release by EMI of the Bruckner
symphonies of German-based maestro Sergiu Celibidache.  Even
before his death in 1996, the Rumanian was often considered by
many to be the last surviving great genius of conducting.  The
release of this collection is all the more special because
Celibidache throughout his lifetime opposed recordings of his
work. Throughout the world, it will be the first chance for
many to discover why music critics wrote that Celibidache was
capable of presenting an entirely new and extremely moving
Bruckner.
<p>

[2] There has always been a special relationship between
Celibidache and Bruckner, the former being said to have
understood the latter like nobody else.
<p>

[3] &ldquo;To him, time is different than it is to other composers.
To a normal man, time is what comes after the beginning. To
Bruckner, time is what comes after the end. All his
apotheotical finals, the hope for another world, the hope of
being saved, of being again baptised in light, it exists
    nowhere else in the same manner&rdquo;&mdash;these were Celibidache&rsquo;s
own words when asked about Bruckner. But what precisely did it
mean for an orchestra? They had to play Bruckner with Celi&rsquo;s
understanding of tempi, which made each symphony sound as if
it were heard for the very first time, and much longer than
ever before.
<p>

[4] &ldquo;It meant very hard work,&rdquo; recalls Joerg Eggebrecht, who plays
first Cello at the Munich Philharmonic orchestra, where Celibidache
conducted from the early eighties until his death. &ldquo;His way of
rehearing put enormous pressure on us. If I study the score as closely
as Celibidache, if I make it my life&rsquo;s work to play Bruckner as
Bruckner meant us to play him&mdash;with great calm and quiet&mdash;then
this means a great effort especially for the wind instruments. Some of
my colleagues had actually taken up yoga in order to fulfil Celi&rsquo;s
breathing technique requirements. The release of the CDs will show
that our brass players play completely different than anything
we have previously heard of Bruckner.&rdquo;
<p>

[5] Eggebrecht recalls that the wind instruments were required
to precisely dosage of their breath. &ldquo;To keep up this enormous
peace and quiet all through the symphony was a great strain&rdquo;
he explains, adding: &ldquo;but it means that our Bruckner
performances were completely lacking in violence.  Every note
could be born at its own pace, all sound had its own space.
Nothing was swallowed up. It was possible to hear every minute
aspect of the music and comprehend what Bruckner had meant to
bring across. It was like a moment of truth, and the musical
space expanded beyond the orchestra, into the audience.&rdquo;
<p>

[6] Eggebrecht feels that Celibidache&rsquo;s Bruckner could have
become a household name. &ldquo;But he did not want to make
recordings,&rdquo; the Cellist explains. &ldquo;He said that our job as an
orchestra is to perform the music as it was written down, to
bring to life again the original emotion which had been felt
at the time of writing. The composer had a certain experience,
he used a kind of shorthand to write it down, and we must
decipher it to bring the experience back to life. This had to
be done anew each time the music was played. Hence, a CD could
not fulfil the same purpose.&rdquo; The only reason why the concert
recordings are now going to be released is due to
Celibidache&rsquo;s son Serge, a film maker who lives in Paris and
who believes that the arguably most fascinating Bruckner
experience there ever was should not die together with his
father.
<p>

[7] Peter Jonas, a graduate of the RCM who has formerly worked
together with Solti in England is now the Intendant of the
Bayerischer Staatsoper in Munich&mdash;the first English speaking
Indendant ever in Germany. &ldquo;I remember his Bruckner
performances very well,&rdquo; Jonas reminiscences. &ldquo;People have
cried openly, without shame. It was so moving, it was more
than mere music.&rdquo;
<p>

[8] It has been said that Celibidache&rsquo;s Bruckner was never an
effort to listen to, that it sounded more like running water
and clothed the soul of the listener. Music critics have called
it natural, flowing, connecting with the very essence of
sound. &ldquo;That is easily explained,&rdquo; says Eggebrecht. &ldquo;We found
in his music elements which said that we are mortal, that we
have an uncontrollable fate, that we go through periods of
loneliness, of being god-removed. For all this there are
symbols in his music. When a sound becomes reality, it is
born. But at the same moment it already dies. The sound C or F
comes out of the cosmic force. It is already there, all I have
to do is to bring it forth on my instrument:  the tuba, the
cello.  The very moment it is born, it dies already. Just take
the wonderful start of the horn in the 4th symphony:  bee bam
da dee.  A very simple structure, where the birth and demise
of a sound is the symbol for life:  how it arises and fades
away.&rdquo;
<p>

[9] In rehearsals, Celibidache&rsquo;s reputation as a slave-driver and
dictator was legendary. &ldquo;Rightly so,&rdquo; recalls Joerg&rsquo;s brother Harald,
a music critic for one of Germany&rsquo;s most respected newspapers. &ldquo;I
remember the first time I was sent to write about a rehearsal. I went
there to write about a monster, whose reputation had preceded him.
And it was exactly as I had been forewarned: there was great drama, he
walked out, he sent a musician outside, he screamed, he abused the
first violins. And yet, it wasn&rsquo;t like I had expected at all. Whatever
he did, he was justified. I realised after a few minutes that his
screaming was not for the sake of it: he had an immensely deep
understanding of what music should be. He would not stand for anything
less than perfection, and he got angry of he felt anyone in his
orchestra was not taking the music as seriously as he did. I became
one of his greatest defenders, and one of his best friends. Outside of
the music, he was the nicest person.&rdquo;
<p>

[10] Indeed, Celibidache must have been a very kind man:  all
his rehearsals were open to the public &ldquo;to give everyone
access to music.&rdquo; He rescued stray dogs from the pound. He
always had an open door and heart for his musicians when
rehearsals were over, and he maintained very close personal
relations with his students and many members of his orchestra.
<p>

[11] One of Celibidache&rsquo;s best friends became Helmut Nicolai,
first viola and today also the head of the Rosamunde quartet,
which is rapidly shooting to fame and will be in the limelight
again this month with the world premiere of Bruckner&rsquo;s
favorite student Hans Rott&rsquo;s string quartet at the Berlin
Festival.
<p>

[12] &ldquo;I do recall my first rehearsal with him,&rdquo; says Nicolai.
&ldquo;I had come from the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under
Karajan, wanting to work with Celibidache, but I had no idea
what it meant. It meant four or five days&rsquo; rehearsal, and each
time we performed a symphony again we had to rehearse it as if
it were the first time.  He wanted a new experience to come
out of the music with every performance. What I liked about
him was that he always called us by our first names, not by
our instrument. It made us feel human, but he wanted something
in return. We were not just to play our own notes but to
listen where our instrument stands in relation to the entire
orchestra. He wanted us to think for ourselves, rather than
just being the executive branch.  We had to consider the music
in its entirety, like the conductor, and he got mad when he
found we were just playing our notes. Once or twice I had to
tell him not to scream at the first violins so much, because
the poor guys got so upset that I was afraid they would
eventually become too scared to ever play freely again. What
he did not understand is that you have to balance compliments
and punishment when you rehearse.&rdquo;
<p>

[13] Joerg was there for the first rehearsal ever with
Celibidache. &ldquo;It started with him saying:  what is wrong with
your breathing technique? to one of the winds. The poor guy
replies:  I breathe like all the others. And Celi goes:  is that
so? You want to be like everyone else, do you? But not here,
not with me.&rdquo;
<p>

[14] &ldquo;And we had to start all over again, as if we had to go
back to school to grade one.  You have to imagine that:  we
were a well-known, well-respected European orchestra.  So a
bass player gets up and he says:  but Maestro, we aren&rsquo;t a
student orchestra.  And Celi says:  but you look like you are.
What&rsquo;s your name? Come on, sit down and play for me.&rdquo;
<p>

[15] &ldquo;And then we really started work. Ten days. It was as if
he had locked the doors to prevent is from leaving, it was
really serious. And he said to us:  you think I am joking,
don&rsquo;t think that, gentlemen.&rdquo;
<p>

[16] Joerg recalls his first Bruckner rehearsal just as
vividly. &ldquo;The first tremolo came up, and he says:  what are you
doing? Chicki, chicki, chicki. Wrong, wrong. The tremolo has
to sound like hot air. What can we do? Let&rsquo;s all play at
different frequencies, come on, try it out.&rdquo;
<p>

[17] Celibidache saw his work on Bruckner&rsquo;s symphonies as
being defined by the syllable sym = unity. Each member of the
orchestra had to be part of the whole. &ldquo;When we went on tour
to the United States,&rdquo; recalls Eggebrecht, &ldquo;although Bruckner
is not as widely known there as he is here, everyone was
spellbound by our performance.  I recall an American colleague
saying at the start:  look they do different bow speeds, but it
sounds nice.&rdquo;
<p>

[18] Nicolai once observed a deeply moved Celibidache at the
grave of Bruckner in St. Florian. &ldquo;There is no question that he
felt very connected to Bruckner as a person.  This may explain
the spectacular sound experiences that he could turn a
Bruckner symphony into. Celibidache had survived the second
World War. As a young man he had been in Berlin when the city
was bombed. He fled from the horror of his memories into the
world of music. With the help of Bruckner, he drowned out the
screams of children he had seen die. Music was more than music
to him, it was his reason for staying alive.&rdquo;
