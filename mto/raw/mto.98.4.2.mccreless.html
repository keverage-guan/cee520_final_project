<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] When I was asked to participate in the twentieth-anniversary
retrospective of the Society for Music Theory, and was given free rein
as to what I would talk about, my first thought was that I could
celebrate our intellectual achievements over the past decade.  The
assigned task was to look back over the past ten years of the
Society&mdash;that is, the ten years since the Rochester meeting in 1987,
the tenth-anniversary meeting, with its topically oriented,
bibliographical plenary session.  It was at that very Rochester
meeting, I have heard it frequently said, that the SMT took a great
intellectual leap forward.  No longer were we just the Society for
Schenker, Set Theory, and the History of Music Theory.  Suddenly we
were the Society for all sorts of other things as well: the philosophy
of music theory, aesthetics, and narrative theory, for example, plus
all the wild and wonderful delights that John Rahn brought into play
in his plenary talk and eventual bibliography on &ldquo;New Research
Paradgims.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Since 1987 our discipline has pushed the frontiers of
Schenkerian, pitch-class and twelve-tone theories, and the history of
theory even further, and in imaginative and distinguished ways.  At
the same time it has opened out into areas such as music perception
and cognition; it has taken spectacular advantage of new technologies,
such as e-mail, the World-Wide web, and distance learning; it has
engaged substantively the critique of music theory by the so-called
New Musicology; it has sought out and adapted to productive analytical
and musical ends a host of critical approaches from other
disciplines&mdash;feminist theory, theories of influence, and
post-structuralist and postmodern theories of various stripes.  It has
engaged the popular music that surrounds us in our own contemporary
culture&mdash;jazz, rock, rap, hip-hop.  And it has seen a rekindled
interest in teaching music theory, including the founding of a
thriving journal on music theory pedagogy.
</p>

<p>[2] As I said, I <i>could</i> celebrate these and other intellectual
achievements.  But surely all of us are already aware of such
accomplishments anyway, and everyone knows that the SMT is more of a
free-wheeling affair than it was in the mid-1980&rsquo;s.  To rehearse all
that would be simply to bore you.  Accordingly, I have hit on
something else to talk about&mdash;something that is important to me now,
for whatever reasons (the years I&rsquo;ve put into the profession, the
books I&rsquo;ve read, the places I&rsquo;ve taught); something that <i>may</i> bore
you, but that I hope will not; something that we do not talk about
frequently, but that is essential to all of our lives, professional
and otherwise.  That something is, in a word, <i>community</i>.  What are
we, as music theorists, or, more specifically, as North American music
theorists, like as a community?  Or, more to the point in the present
context, how is our community different in 1997 as compared to what it
was in 1987?  How has the function of the community changed?  How has
the power structure changed?  How is it different for me, or for you,
as an individual member of the profession, to negotiate the space of
the community, to participate in and contribute to the discipline, to
create a self, now, as opposed to ten years ago, or even twenty years
ago?
</p>

<p>[3] In approaching the music-theoretical community <i>as</i> a community, I
recognize that the subject is a complex one.  Analyzing a community
involves evaluating how it functions internally, with respect to how
it is governed and how its members interact; how it functions
externally, with respect to other communities and to society at large;
and how it works for the individual.  I can hardly do full justice to
such an endeavor in a short paper.  But I can step back and take a
broad view of the SMT as a society, as a social body, and make a few
observations about how it has changed over the past ten or twenty
years.  In so doing, I will begin with what I see as the easiest
task&mdash;to describe how the internal workings of the Society have
changed.  I will then proceed to the more difficult issues of relating
our community to other communities, musical, academic and beyond, and
of analyzing the relation between the Society and its individual
members: how it regulates, encourages, empowers, and educates us.
</p>

<p>[4] When I consider what it feels like to be a member of the SMT now,
as opposed to ten or twenty years ago, what first comes to mind is
that the Society is less monolithic.  That it is less monolithic in
its intellectual programme I have already mentioned&mdash;though I should
note in passing that a look at the early conferences and the early
volumes of <i>Music Theory Spectrum</i> shows convincingly that it was
never so monolithic it as its detractors, both internal and external,
sometimes portrayed it as being.  But, for better or worse, the past
ten years have indeed witnessed both a widening of scope and what my
friend Richard Kaplan has called the &ldquo;Balkanization&rdquo; of music theory:
our conference programs are more varied, it is more difficult for
program committees to predict which sessions will draw a large crowd,
and there has been a proliferation of organized interest groups that
were not at all characteristic of the Society in its first decade.
</p>

<p>[5] The Society is less monolithic administratively than it used to be
as well.  In the early days, as was natural for a small, new
organization, power was concentrated in the hands of those few who
conceived the idea of a music theory Society and brought it into being
in the first place.  Since the Society had no initiatives except to
keep itself going, plan conferences, and produce a journal, the only
administrative groups were the Executive Board, the Publications
Committee, and the annual Program and Local Arrangements Committees to
plan the conferences.  But now, with a few hundred more members than
we had a decade ago, and all sorts of new initiatives on the table,
there has been a proliferation of committees analogous to the
proliferation of new intellectual interests: the Committee on the
Status of Women, the Awards Committee, the Networking Operations
Committee, the Committee on Diversity, the Committee on Professional
Development.  All of these committees were organized in response to
palpable needs in the Society&mdash;needs for diversity, for recognition of
distinguished scholarship, for state-of-the-art communication, for
mentoring.
</p>

<p>[6] Concomitant with this expansion of the Society&rsquo;s tasks has been a
significant dispersion or levelling out of power.  Part of the
levelling process has been the result of a natural generational shift.
Gradually over the past ten years, the leadership of the Society has
passed from the hands of the small generation of its founders, who
guided it so well, to the much larger generation of theorists my age
and younger.  (What better tribute could there be to the first
generation of our Society than that they nurtured so well the larger
generation that followed?)  At the same time, the multiplication of
the society&rsquo;s interests and initiatives has meant that more and more
of our members are now able to contribute in substantive ways, at
earlier and earlier stages of their careers.  In addition, the advent
of electronic communication&mdash;remember, in 1987, and even in the early
1990&rsquo;s, theorists communicated via the U. S. Post Office and Ma
Bell&mdash;has levelled our music-theoretical playing field even more: it
now means less to be located geographically at a major urban center or
prestigious university, and it means less whether one is an
established scholar or a graduate student.  Many new and original
voices that would never have been heard ten or twenty years ago are
now heard.  Even the small change of the term of the SMT President
from three years to two has changed the dynamic of the Society, since
the two-year term assures a frequent turnover of leadership and a
regular injection of new ideas.  Past President Joe Straus and I have
in fact ruminated in jest together over the inevitable: that by twenty
or twenty-five years from now we will have a whole pasture full of
ex-SMT presidents contentedly munching away at conferences and
watching wistfully from the sidelines.
</p>

<p>[7] All in all, it seems to me that SMT&rsquo;s record as a functioning
community has been a good one, and something to be proud of.  We have
grown, we have expanded our interests, we have broadened the powers of
decision-making, and we have responded to the needs of our members
within and to the challenges, technological and otherwise, without.
To be sure, much remains to be done.  We are nowhere close to being as
diverse as we want to be: we have but a tiny number of minority
members, and women constitute only about a quarter of our
membership&mdash;on both counts we lag far behind both AMS and SEM.  And we
have much to do in the area of relating our work to a public beyond
the confines of our own, admittedly rather small Society.
</p>

<p>[8] It is thus to the question of how our community relates to other
musical and intellectual communities, and to the public, the society,
at large, that I now turn.  To that end, I ask you to join me in a
thought experiment.  Imagine, improbable though it seems, that the
academic music community is at the center of the social organization
of the entire population of the world, and that the music theory
community is at the center of the center.  From that center we move
out in ever broadening concentric circles, first to our students, then
to sister societies in the academic musical world&mdash;AMS, SEM, and
CMS&mdash;then to professionals in the larger world of the Western art
music to which we have been primarily dedicated, then to amateurs in
this same tradition, then to professionals, listeners, and consumers
of our own popular musics, and then to participants in musics of other
cultures.  What does such a music-theoretical perspective on the world
yield?
</p>

<p>[9] What it first yields, I hope, is a realistic appraisal of where
our music-academic society fits into musical culture worldwide.  Of
course, placing our small SMT at the center of all human beings who
experience and participate in music&mdash;that is, virtually everyone on
the planet&mdash;may seem not only preposterous, but offensive as well,
inasmuch as it ostensibly reinscribes a form of ethnocentrism,
cultural centrism, and elitism that we rightly seek to avoid.  But I
do not intend it as such.  We all peer out at the world from inside
ourselves&mdash;selves that are, for better or worse, the center of
experience for <i>us</i>.  I am not claiming that anyone else sees us at
the center of the world, but that we, to understand our place in that
world, must know what it feels like to look out from our own center.
In constructing my fantasy, I have thus tried to place our SMT selves
in a position that accords with where we really are&mdash;that is, in close
proximity to the few with whom we have the most in common, more
distant from the many with whom we share less, and on any account,
rather narrow and specialized.  Drawing the picture in this way points
up <i>what</i> we are: a group of music scholars who study, write about,
and teach the theory and analysis of music&mdash;principally Western art
music, but increasingly, other musics as well.
</p>

<p>[10] I am not the first to imagine the music theorist at the center of
things.  Over twenty-five years ago, Leonard Meyer, at a seminar at
the University of Michigan, predicted that in music, by the end of the
century, the <i>theorist</i> would be at the center of the action&mdash;that is,
<i>really</i> at the center of the action, not just heuristically so, in a
self-evaluative fantasy, as I am presenting here.  Why?  Although I do
not know all the details&mdash;I was not a member of the seminar, and I
heard this story second-hand&mdash;I might speculate that in Meyer&rsquo;s
pluralistic world of stylistic stasis and competing artistic and
intellectual currents, the clear-minded theorist might represent a
much needed beacon of light.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p>[11] So here we are at the end of the century.  Do <i>we</i> <i>rule</i>?&mdash;as
the teenage sitcoms say?  And are we a much needed beacon of light?
Meyer&rsquo;s prediction to the contrary, we can still hardly claim that &ldquo;we
rule,&rdquo; either in the music-academic world or the world at large.  And
whether we are a beacon of light depends on what it is that one sees
our work as shedding light upon.  We have, I think, generally seen
ourselves as illuminating <i>music</i>.  But not everyone agrees.  A charge
that has frequently been leveled against us as theorists is that we
treat music as a disembodied object to be studied, parsed, and
explained; hence the portrayal of or work in some circles in recent
years as &ldquo;formalist.&rdquo;  As we move out through our concentric circles
from SMT to AMS, SEM and CMS, from theory to musicology,
ethnomusicology, and music pedagogy in general, we find ourselves
haunted by formalism, since our work, in comparison to <i>their</i> work,
seems to be particularly vulnerable to such a charge.  A central plank
in the SMT&rsquo;s breaking from AMS twenty years ago was, ironically
enough, that we wanted to, and claimed that we could, engage music
directly, as &ldquo;music itself,&rdquo; without the trappings of style
identification, manuscript provenance or social history.  Now the
tables have turned, and we are portrayed as being lost, or trapped,
within the &ldquo;music itself&rdquo; (a music that apparently doesn&rsquo;t exist
anyway) and we are seen as being blind to its expressive,
communicative, and cultural meanings&mdash;as being both insular and
formalist.  Musicologists criticize us for allegedly using pieces only
to exemplify theories, ethnomusicologists criticize us for being
interested only in structure rather than meaning and social function
(and that in only a tiny fraction of the world&rsquo;s music), and many CMS
members, and indeed many of our own members as well, have from the
very beginning criticized us as being elitist, as devoting our
attentions only to analysis, and as being unconcerned with pedagogy.
(Paradoxically, it is the latter, of course, that, much more than any
analysis or research that we do, keeps bread on the table, and still
makes us in some respects more employable than our colleagues in
sister music-academic disciplines.)
</p>

<p>[12] And for many of our neighbors in the widening circles beyond the
music-academic community, our music theory is neither a dominant force
nor a guiding light.  Neither our conventional pedagogy nor our
theory-based analysis sells well in a larger public forum.  Pedagogy,
our bread and butter, is simply uninteresting to the general public,
and analysis is too technical to be accessible to the
non-professional.  Music, as an art, also lends itself more than the
visual arts and literature to abstract, technical, insider analysis
and criticism.  Whatever the virtues of our analyses and our
analytical systems, they resist popularization, and they tend to keep
us looking insular.  Critics of art and literature, and&mdash;truth be
told&mdash;music historians as well, reach a large audience far more easily
than we theorists do.  All of us can think of musicologists whose work
appears at least occasionally in daily newspapers, or in periodicals
such as <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, or the
<i>New Republic</i>.  But how many theorists do we see there?  The educated
public, and even the music performance establishment and the academic
community, can relate easily to the Bach, Handel, or Mozart scholar,
or to the specialist in a given repertoire.  It cannot relate so
easily to the technical work of the music theorist.
</p>

<p>[13] All of which raises the question: what is our community, <i>as</i> a
community, about?  To what extent is it about doing work&mdash;technical or
otherwise&mdash;that we find rewarding and stimulating for an audience of
ourselves and each other, and to what extent is it about reaching out
to other musical and other communities that transcend our own?  We
might first consider these questions in terms of the mandates set
forth when our Society was founded in 1977.  Our founders identified a
need in academic musical culture for a scholarly and pedagogical
organization focusing on music theory, and our organization&rsquo;s task has
been, for the past twenty years, to open itself to all with an
interest in the discipline, to create a coherent and active scholarly
community, and to raise the level of music-theoretical discourse.  Or,
paraphrasing our own by-laws: to further scholarship and teaching in
music theory at the highest level possible, and to provide a forum for
same.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> These are the goals that we set for ourselves, and few will
argue that we have not made great strides toward achieving them.
</p>

<p>[14] But to answer our questions about the degree to which we should
reach out beyond ourselves, we somehow need to square this positive
view of our accomplishments and our smoothly functioning
music-theoretical community with the negative view that began to
emerge when we tried to place music theory at the center of the
musical, and then of the social, world.  If we have done so well, why
do we have the two problems that raised their ugly heads in our
fantasy&mdash;the &ldquo;formalism&rdquo; problem and the &ldquo;insularity&rdquo; problem?  One
answer (and surely some SMT members will take this point of view) that
these two problems are red herrings, that they are not problems at
all.  Such a position might turn on the argument that we are a
scholarly society, scholarly societies are by definition specialized,
we are specialized, and so therefore we are doing what we are supposed
to be doing.  From this point of view, if we are to expand, our
expansion should be based on finding members and promoting activities
that are congruent with our established interests: bringing into the
Society teachers of music theory who have thus far been unaware of or
uninterested in, or who have felt excluded by our work; attracting
foreign scholars who are interested in our work and who might
contribute to our journals and conferences; and lecturing and in other
ways making contacts abroad.  On this view, not only are formalism and
insularity not problems for us; the charges that they <i>are</i> problems
are refuted before our very eyes: we are bringing more members with
more diverse backgrounds into the Society, including more minority
members; foreign scholars are making splendid contributions to <i>Music
Theory Online</i>, <i>smt-list</i>, and <i>mto-talk</i>; we are planning to invite
international scholars to speak at our national conference in Atlanta
in 1999.
</p>

<p>[15] But for some of our members, whatever the value of all these
initiatives, they do not address the underlying problem.  This
counter-position might claim that the SMT is indeed formalist and
insular, and for the following reasons.  Despite the Society&rsquo;s mandate
to further both the best scholarship the best pedagogy, its real
energies have gone into the scholarly arena more than the pedagogical
one.  That it has done so is, of course, a perfectly understandable
course of action for an academic society.  Academic societies tend to
foster the best work in an area of specialization; in so doing, they
make the discipline more and more specialized.  And by establishing a
public, competitive forum for such work, they establish a mechanism
for the gauging of individual success.  They enable more practitioners
of the discipline to keep up with the cutting edge and to maintain a
higher general level of competence, but more fundamentally, they make
it more possible to judge what that cutting edge is, thus
inadvertently encouraging their members to become more and more narrow
if they want to keep abreast of current developments and make their
own mark on the discipline.  Scholarly societies thus provide for a
discipline both a means of cooperation and a means of competition.
And both the cooperation and the competition tend to push the decimal
places of research further and further out, thereby removing the
discipline&rsquo;s work further and further from anyone but practitioners
themselves.  It requires little imagination to see that at least some
of this general description is applicable to the SMT.
</p>

<p>[16] If one believes that research and knowledge are of value for
their own sake, this state of affairs offers no problem.  But others
want to see research reach out to a larger public.  We all remember
Senator William Proxmire&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Fleece&rdquo; Awards: awards that he
presented for what he took to be the most useless federally supported
research that he could find each year.  Of course, music and music
scholarship are hardly exempt from such criticism, as anyone even
remotely familiar with the so-called New Musicology&rsquo;s critique of
music theory will know.  Nor are our music-scholarly culture wars of
the 90&rsquo;s unique.  We all know of the government-sponsored &ldquo;Socialist
Realist&rdquo; attacks on the music of Shostakovich and Prokofiev in the
Soviet Union of the late 1940&rsquo;s: their music was &ldquo;formalist,&rdquo; and not
for &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;  And in Germany in the first few decades of this century, 
a similar
controversy&mdash;one also turning on issues of insularity and elitism, but
focusing on music <i>scholarship</i> rather than on music&mdash;had already erupted. 
As Lee Rothfarb has shown, a central plank of August Halm&rsquo;s vision for
music theory was the education of an ever wider musical public, in the
hopes of creating a culture in which musical citizens could understand the
meaning of art music themselves, rather than being dependent on the whims
of journalistic critics.  And Pamela Potter has pointed out that in German
musicology, Hermann Kretzschmar, in 1903, and many of the most renowned
scholars of the following decades (Friedrich Blume, Johannes Wolf, Arnold
Schering) argued that musicology was too inbred, and that it should turn
from its &ldquo;ivory-tower isolationism&rdquo; and serve the public&mdash;at least the
music-loving public.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>  To be sure, our cultural situation in the
musical and scholarly world of the U.S. in the 1990&rsquo;s is entirely
different from that of the Soviet Union of the 1940&rsquo;s and 1950&rsquo;s or
the Germany in the first few decades of the century.  But in these
historical precedents we do see a recurring theme of anxiety, whether
justified or not, about the degree to which music, in one case, or
musical scholarship, in the other, should be for the few or the many.
</p>

<p>[17] So an important mission for us in the years to come is to decide
how to deal with issues of community: to decide if and how we want to
grow, and in what manner; to decide how to keep our community open and
diverse, and at the same time internally healthy; to answer the
questions of whether we should reach out to those in the concentric
circles around us, and if we should, how far out we should reach.  If
we ignore criticisms of our work and decide to retrench, we run the
risk of becoming what the sociologist Robert Bellah would call a
&ldquo;lifestyle enclave&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a community of individuals with common
interests who band together to enjoy their common passions safely (in
a &ldquo;gated community,&rdquo; as it were) but with little concern for a larger
social good.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>  Or, put another way, we run the risk of being an
&ldquo;insular,&rdquo; &ldquo;insider&rdquo; community that pursues its own &ldquo;formalist&rdquo;
interests in blithe disregard of its connection to other artistic,
intellectual, and cultural entities.  But if we reach out without a
sober accounting of why we are doing so, we risk diluting what we do
best, and chasing after goals that academic societies cannot achieve
anyway.
</p>

<p>[18] If I read our present situation correctly, and if I hear
correctly what my colleagues who have preceded me on this plenary
session have already said, some reaching out at this point in our
history is both right and appropriate.  But we will do well not only
to reach out to <i>expand</i> our world <i>of</i> music theory, but also to
reach out <i>into</i> the world&mdash;whether of performers, other musical
scholars, other scholars, or members of other musical
communities&mdash;<i>through</i> music theory.  We might take as one of our
causes in the coming years that of balancing the inwardly directed
scholarly impulses that have brought us so many intellectual successes
in the past twenty years with outwardly directed energies that connect
us to the musical, academic, and social communities around us.  For in
pushing our specialized knowledge further and further <i>out</i>, we have
sometimes ended up withdrawing further and further <i>in</i> to our own
lifestyle enclave.  To be sure, we are an academic society, not a
political one.  We can&rsquo;t, at least <i>as</i> an academic society, feed the
poor or stop the wars, even though our members may do what they can on
these fronts in other venues.  Nor is it necessarily incumbent upon us
to hold ourselves to the standards of social relevance and engagement
propounded in the latest fashions in our sister academic societies,
musical or otherwise.  But it is surely incumbent upon us to be aware
of the diverse communities around us, and to remember, however
involved we become in our own work, how small we and our intellectual
and musical traditions are in the world at large.
</p>

<p>[19] We can decide for ourselves as individuals how far out beyond our
music-theoretical center we want to reach.  As both scholars and
teachers, there is much that we can do.  It is our privilege to share
music and music theory every day with students.  Our privilege is a
particularly rewarding one, because as we all know, theory teachers
and theory students somehow have a special relationship.  Perhaps
because the experience of learning to describe musical perceptions
with concepts is an unusually personal and rich one, we can interact
with students at a level that rivals that which students have with
individual performance and composition teachers.  Much of the richness
of such interactions arises from what we as theorists do: for most of
us there remains a value and a beauty in the finely wrought close
analysis, the elegant theory&mdash;and is not our loving preservation of
the close reading, the grasping and understanding of intricate detail,
a cultural contribution in its own right these days?  There is for
most of us also a value and a beauty in teaching the simpler elements
of music, and in finding ways that meaning in music connects to
meaning in our lives.  Our success as a community in the coming years
will ultimately depend on how well we can communicate our sense of
value, beauty, and meaning in music through our teaching and
scholarship; and on how well, and how humbly, we can remain, in our
teaching and scholarship, vigilantly aware of both the riches of our
own musical culture and the riches of other musical cultures around
us.</p>
