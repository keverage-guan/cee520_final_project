<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Some of you may be wondering who the hell Neurath is and what on
earth his boat has to do with music theory. Let me assure you that
there is method to my madness and that the connections will become
clear as the paper unfolds.  For the record, Neurath was a philosopher
who helped found the Vienna Circle in the 1920s.  He wrote papers on
sociology, politics, and education.  It was in one of these essays
that he used the metaphor of a leaking boat to explain how people
acquired their knowledge of the outside world.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> In recent years
Neurath&rsquo;s boat has become associated with an even more famous
philosopher, the celebrated American logician Willard Van Orman
Quine.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> My goal is to use Quine&rsquo;s version of this metaphor to shed
light on recent debates between music theory and New Musicology.
Obviously, to understand the relevance of Neurath&rsquo;s boat it is
important to determine what the current debate is really about.  This,
however, is no simple task because the discussion covers a wide range
of topics and viewpoints.  At the very least, it raises questions of
ideology and scope&mdash;that is, of deciding what the purpose of music
theory should be and what aspects of music should be studied.  But it
also raises questions about how music theory should be conducted, and
it is these epistemological or methodological issues that I will focus
on.  To keep things as simple as possible, I have written a short
fairy tale.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> It&rsquo;s a story with a happy ending for theorists, but one
that makes big concessions to New Musicology.  Although the characters
are all fictional, they are composite sketches drawn from a wide range
of authors.  Some of these sources can be found in the notes.  Well,
if you are sitting comfortably, then I&rsquo;ll begin.<p>


[2] Not such a long time ago in a galaxy not far from our own, there
lived a staid music theorist, or SMT for short.  He was an earnest
fellow who eked out a meager existence with his two trusty droids,
ArtusiDeetusi and 3ZPo.  SMT cared a lot about music and tried to find
nice, tidy ways to understand specific pieces.  Every day he took out
his scores and pried them apart to find some underlying structures.
SMT tried to satisfy three constraints of objectivity, truth, and
autonomy.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> He checked that he had objectively separated the method
being used from the observations being made, and was confident that
other analysts would come up with similar results if they used the
same methods on the same pieces.  SMT believed his results were true
because they fit the facts and autonomous because they weren&rsquo;t
contaminated by stuff that wasn&rsquo;t in the notes on the page.
By comparing different analyses he searched for an optimum
reading. Deep down, SMT knew that there were probably other ways to
look at music, but this one paid the bills&mdash;well, sort of.<p>


[3] Anyway, one day, SMT heard a knock at his door.  When he opened
it, he saw before him a slick new musicologist, or SNM for short.  Fed
up with authenticating, dating, and editing scores, SNM wanted to
analyze them as well and had come to see what SMT was up to.  When SNM
saw those nice, tidy methods, he called SMT nasty names&mdash;positivist,
objectivist, and modernist!<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Instead of agonizing over every note in
every measure, SNM wanted to look at music in wider terms.  He wanted
to include all the stuff that wasn&rsquo;t in the notes on the page.  His
motto was &quot;the more the merrier and the messier, the better.&quot;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> He
chuckled at the idea of an objective analysis.  He knew better; he
knew that analyses are always theory laden.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> SNM was also skeptical
that analyses could ever be true; he thought that they were at best
provisional and depended on the analyst&rsquo;s theoretical
preconceptions.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> And SNM wasn&rsquo;t impressed that SMT treated scores
autonomously; for him they can only be understood within some
cultural, intertextual, or subjective context.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup><p>

[4] For a while SMT and SNM dismissed their disagreements as simple
Turf Wars. But things changed when SNM started to lash out at SMT.
SNM took the idea that analyses are theory-laden and inferred that the
main features of an analysis come not from the piece, but from the
listener&rsquo;s head.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> SNM claimed that analyses are ventriloquistic
acts in which analysts manipulate the piece to suit their own
purposes.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> He also decided that, since analyses are provisional and
incomplete, they must necessarily be misreadings.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> The analyst&rsquo;s
task was to evaluate the relative strength of the misreading.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>Having given up the quest for definitive analyses, SNM wanted many
readings.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> He didn&rsquo;t care if they were true or bound by causal
laws, just that they were illuminating and entertaining.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> One by
one, SNM replaced objectivity with subjectivity, truth with
relativism, and autonomy with contextualism.  The crowd loved it,
especially when he suggested that his new methods demanded not less,
but more rigor.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup><p>

[5] &quot;Rigor mortis, more like!&quot; thought SMT. He didn&rsquo;t think that
empirical methods were as bad as all that, and was reluctant to
abandon objectivity, truth, and autonomy altogether.  SMT was also
worried by some of SNM&rsquo;s more extreme positions.  To begin with,
although SMT agreed that analysis are always theory-laden, he didn&rsquo;t
think that there were no pieces without a listener.  He came up with a
simple counter-example.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Imagine two piano sonatas by Beethoven.
Although SNM is free to create whatever readings he liked, no one
would expect him to produce the same analysis for both pieces.  Why?
Because the music is different, and not just because SNM produced his
analyses on different days or from different contexts.  At some level
the physical differences between each piece must constrain SNM&rsquo;s
thinking. Similarly, when SNM spoke of the relative strength of a
misreading, or an illuminating analogy, as compared to what?  A
misreading can only be a misreading if it is measured against some
standard and an analogy can only be illuminating if it clarifies
something that was previously obscure.  The moral is that it is one
thing to claim that all observation is theory-laden and quite another
to claim that we can never find observations that are neutral with
respect to the theory or analysis being tested.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Indeed, scientists
regularly perform such checks and balances; these control experiments
ensure that the results can be repeated by a community of fellow
inquirers.  Such intersubjective corroboration keeps the individual in
touch with reality.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup><p>

[6] Next, SMT conceded that his analyses were provisional and
incomplete, but denied that they were just misreadings.  He noted that
the snag with empirical arguments is not so much that they are true or
false, as that they always fall short of certainty.  This much was
discussed by Hume in the eighteenth century and was expanded more recently
by Hempel and Goodman.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> SMT recalled a chat he overheard between a
physicist and a layman about flying saucers.  The physicist insisted
that they do not exist.  But, when the layman asked him to prove it,
he could not.  The physicist admitted that he could only say &quot;what is
more likely or what is less likely,&quot; and not prove once and for all
what is possible and impossible.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> The story underscored an
important point: it is one thing to ask what makes a given analysis
true, and quite another to ask how we know whether it is
justified. Empiricism does the latter not the former; its arguments
gain force insofar as they predict future events and are falsified when
they make bad predictions.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup><p>

[7] Finally, while SMT realized that he could never explain pieces
autonomously, he was not convinced that cultural, intertextual, or
subjective knowledge was any more relevant or reliable than other sorts
of knowledge.  SNM was right to insist that we always encounter music
in a cultural context, but SMT knew our understanding of that music is
shaped by other factors as well. At some point, for example, our basic
biological and cognitive capacities must come into play.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>Furthermore, it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to SMT that cultural, intertextual, and
subjective knowledge is really so different from other types of
knowledge.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> After all, SNM invoked facts about culture, politics,
society, gender, and so forth.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> But how did he know they were facts
and how did he know which of the many possible facts to use?  Surely
he did so using the same empirical methods as SMT.  His facts were no
less certain and no less theory-laden. And although SNM assumed that
we know ourselves better than we know the external world, SMT wasn&rsquo;t
so sure.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Psychologists had convinced him just how fallible self-
knowledge and introspection can be.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> And philosophers such as
Wittgenstein had shown that the first-person perspective is not the
best starting point for philosophy, still less as the foundation
for any theory of knowledge.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> Now SMT did not deny that cultural,
intertextual, or subjective knowledge was relevant to musical
analysis; he simply saw no a priori reason to privilege it. This is
because relevancy and reliability are epistemic rather than cultural,
intertextual, or subjective issues.  This point was perfectly evident
in recent discussions of the so-called frame problem.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup><p>

[8] SMT was left in a quandary.  How could he accept SNM&rsquo;s criticisms
yet hold onto the notions of objectivity, truth, and autonomy? At
first, SMT was unsure about what to do, but he soon felt a strange
force inside and became empowered to strike back.  He grabbed the
phone.  He thought he&rsquo;d called the psychic hot-line, but realized what
his mistake when a voice asked him if he wanted &quot;a five-minute
argument, or the full half hour?&quot;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> SMT went for the latter.<p>

[9] The argument clinic wasn&rsquo;t what he expected and it wasn&rsquo;t located
in a swamp somewhere in the Dagobah system.  The secretary introduced
him to an amiable but austere man named Obi Van Quinobi.  Although SMT
wasn&rsquo;t used to explaining theories and things from a logical point of
view, he described his debate with SNM.  He spoke of objectivity,
truth, and autonomy, and even pulled out a graph of <i>Gurrelieder</i> that
he happened to have lying around.  After listening carefully Obi Van
said he had bad news and good news.  He said that if SMT really was a
positivist, then he had better change his tune.  Positivism was dead.
His criticisms sounded a lot like SNM&rsquo;s.  Obi Van refused to draw
a line between theory and observation and suggested that &quot;theoretical
sentences grade off to observation sentences.&quot;<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> Obi Van agreed with
SNM that what we take to be true depends on our theoretical
outlook.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> Nothing he claimed, was immune to revision and, since all
analyses are underdetermined by the data, a single piece can yield
indefinitely many readings.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> And, like SNM, Obi Van rejected any
idea of understanding pieces autonomously; he insisted that &quot;our
statements about the external world face a tribunal of sense
experience not individually but only as a corporate body.&quot;<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup><p>

[10] So much for the bad news, what about the good news?  Obi Van said
although positivism may be sunk, empiricism could still be salvaged.
He recounted a story told to him in the olden days.  According to the
story, empiricists resemble sailors at sea on a leaking boat.  Instead
of rebuilding their boat from the keel up in a dry dock, they fix the
leaks while adrift on the open water. As each plank is replaced, the
remaining timbers keep the craft afloat.  But once one leak is patched
another appears; bit by bit the boat becomes transformed, being
carried along by nothing but the evolving conceptual scheme
itself.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> In other words, empirical research is always open ended.
Researchers do not begin with a blank slate, they do not have fool
proof methods, and they do not reach definitive solutions.  Instead,
they plunge<i> in medias res</i>.  They must tentatively believe all of
their inherited world view, but they must also realize that some
unidentified portions are wrong.<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> They must improve, clarify, and
understand by trading off evidence with system: too much evidence
creates a mere record of observations; too much system creates a myth
without foundation.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> By focusing on the way in which the empiricist
justifies his beliefs, epistemology grades off with psychology,
thereby naturalizing the former.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup><p>

[11] Obi Van said that Neurath&rsquo;s boat did not commit him to the
inferences made by SNM.  Although Obi Van blurred the line between
theory and observation, he still believed that there are objective
physical facts which root our beliefs in reality.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> This meant that
the boat was a real boat and the leaks were real leaks.  Obi Van also
said that while he rejected empiricism as a theory of truth, he
accepted it as a theory of evidence.<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> Although empiricism never
gives us absolute truth, it can give us results that cover existing
answers, make accurate predictions of future events, and are
repeatable by other researchers.  This was a direct contrast to SNM.
Finally, Obi Van recognized that our beliefs about the world do not
arise autonomously, but in a complex web that touches reality only at
the edges.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> But he didn&rsquo;t believe that cultural, intertextual, or
subjective data were the only elements of the web.<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> For him the web
encompassed the complete range of empirical knowledge, or at least big
chunks of it.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup><p>

[12] Well, I&rsquo;d like to say that SMT went home, won a MacArthur
Fellowship, and lived happily ever after.  But I can&rsquo;t.  Alas, it&rsquo;s
not clear how we should interpret Obi Van&rsquo;s words and objections.
What we need is a reality check.  In the remainder of this paper I
want to spell out what a naturalized music theory looks like in
general and what specific applications it may foster.<p>

[13] Although there are many ways to naturalize music theory, they
usually involve two things: 1) rejecting any foundationalist set of
standards for evaluating theories and analyses; and 2) seeking
law-like connections between so-called aesthetic and non-aesthetic
properties.<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> In the first case, naturalized music theory suggests
that the issue of evaluating theories and analyses is closely entwined
with the matter of empiric demonstration.  It puts a premium on the
idea that music theories and analyses should be judged according to
their empiric adequacy&mdash;that is, whether they fit the physical
facts&mdash;and their predictive power&mdash;that is, whether they predict how
particular musical relationships will occur in future instances.  In
other words, it accepts the possibility of constructing law-like
generalizations about musical phenomena and the emotional states that
create, and that these generalizations can be confirmed by other
people.<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> In the second case, by seeking law-like connections
between aesthetic and non-aesthetic properties, naturalized music
theory blurs the distinction between music theory, psycho-acoustics,
cognitive psychology, and neuro-biology.  By focusing on how people
come to understand and respond to music, it places the knowing subject
back into the discussion, yet it does so, not in an solipsistic sense,
but in the sense that private views can be confirmed intersubjectively
by empiric tests.<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup><p>

[14] To show the impact that naturalizing might have on music theory,
let me offer a single example.  One area in which music theory and New
Musicology have interacted has been is over the question of influence;
one of the best-known ways to explain it is Harold Bloom&rsquo;s so-called
Anxiety Theory of poetic influence.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> For Bloom, influence often
involves a violent response to the past and the people who shaped it.
According to him, poems are aggressive rewritings of earlier poems; it
is only by misreading that strong poets exert power over their
precursors.<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> How does Bloom support his theory?  In a narrow sense,
he does so using six revisionary ratios.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup> These ratios provide a
litmus test for spotting when influence may or may not have occurred.
In a broader sense, he does so by basing the ratios on various
Freudian notions, such as those of repression, or the Oedipus
Complex.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> These concepts provide the explanatory backbone for his
theory.  Now, if we are going to approach the problem of influence
from a naturalized standpoint, then we must consider the empiric
adequacy and predictive power of the revisionary ratios and the
Freudian concepts underpinning them.  Alas, neither claim is very
secure.  On the one hand, Bloom&rsquo;s ratios are unfalsifiable and
ultimately solipsistic.  If, as one commentator notes, similarity and
dissimilarity can both be signs of influence, any piece written before
another piece could have served as an influence.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> How do we know
which dissimilarities have arise from influence and which ones do not?
On the other hand, serious doubts have been raised about the
falsifiability of Freudian theory.  Popper, Grunbaum, and others have
suggested that clinical observation might be irrevocably
theory-laden.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup><p>

[15] Are there other ways to try to understand influence from a
naturalized standpoint?  I think the answer to this question is yes.
I see great opportunities for explaining influence in terms of the
theories of learning, memory, and expertise.<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> Although these are
both growing fields, cognitive scientists have suggested that learning
involves processes such as abstraction, generalization, and problem
solving, and that experts store their knowledge hierarchically in
schemas.  A strong case can, I think be made, for regarding
Schenkerian theory as a model for explaining expert tonal composition.
There are good reasons to treat Schenker&rsquo;s <i>Ursatz</i> and
transformations as abstract representations of certain general laws of
tonal motion.  And, as Robert Gjerdingen has pointed out, Schenkerian
graphs show us how expert tonal composers treat their material
according to top-down schemas.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup> Since novice composers first master
the principles of tonality in local rather than global contexts, it
seems that the capacity to abstract them globally is a sign of
expertise. Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s experiments on large-scale tonal closure
seem to confirm this point.<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> To quell fears that Schenkerian
theory is unfalsifiable, recent work by Douglas Dempster, Dave Headlam,
and myself, has suggested that there are testable limits to the
model.<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup><p>

[16] To sum up, as I see it, the current debate between music theory
and New Musicology raises important epistemological and methodological
issues.  To the extent that New Musicologists tell a cautionary tale
about the limits of music theory, I think their points are well
taken and warrant a proper response.  Yes, there are problems in
dealing with empirical knowledge.  Yes, we must reject the
positivist&rsquo;s accounts of objectivity, truth, and autonomy.  Yes, we
must tighten up the ways in which we test theories and analyses.  But
if this is all New Musicologists are up to, then they should tone down
the rhetoric; their skepticism is not nearly as novel as they suggest
and their attacks on empiricism go too far.  However, when New
Musicologists call for a wholesale rejection of empiricism, I part
company with them.  No, I&rsquo;m not convinced they have overcome the
methodological problems that they and I see in traditional music
theory.  No, I&rsquo;m not convinced that they&rsquo;ve offered a coherent set of
epistemic guidelines for engaging in analytical discourse.  No, I do
not believe that they&rsquo;ve provided the only alternative for the future.
For my part, I prefer to naturalize music theory. Such a view
emphasizes the need to find law-like relationships not only among
aesthetic properties, but also between aesthetic and non-aesthetic
properties.<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> It blurs the line between music theory and cognitive
psychology and it erodes the distinction between theory, analysis, and
criticism.<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup> Will naturalized music theory work?  That, I think, is
an open empiric question.<sup><a name="FN59REF" href="#FN59" id="footnote59">(59)</a></sup> The best way to find out is to go and
see for ourselves.  Some of you may balk at this idea; that&rsquo;s your
choice and the field is surely big enough to admit different points of
view.  But for those of us who are willing to crew with Neurath, the
prospects are extremely exciting, though please, could someone pack the
Dramamine?</p>

and McClary, &ldquo;Briefly stated, the disciplines of music theory and
musicology are grounded on the assumption of musical autonomy.  They
cautiously keep separate considerations of biography, patronage, place
and dates from those of musical syntax and structure.  Both
disciplines likewise claim objectivity, the illusion of which is
possible only when the questions considered valid are limited to those
that can, in fact, be answered without qualification.  The ideology
of autonomy also informs the conventional musical reception of
the &lsquo;music lover&rsquo; who listens to music precisely to withdraw from the
real world and to experience what is taken to be authentic
subjectivity.&rdquo; Richard Leppert and Susan McClary, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo;

always in a narrower sense of a phase of compositional history) are
faces that bear a strong family resemblance to one another.  They have
been put from time to time upon a conception of knowing that has had a
continuous life virtually throughout the history of Western culture:

Cook comes to similar conclusions, &ldquo;the theory of music is grounded in

neither a feasible nor a desirable aim.&rdquo;  Nicholas Cook, <i>Music

(1980): 208&ndash;209.  Similarly, according to Suzanne Cusick, &ldquo;There can
be no perfect reading of any text, be it archival, theoretical, or
musical<nobr>. . . . </nobr>the &lsquo;new musicology&rsquo;<nobr> . . . </nobr>requires that we confront the

and McClary, &ldquo;Briefly stated, the disciplines of music theory and
musicology are grounded on the assumption of musical autonomy.  They
cautiously keep separate considerations of biography, patronage, place
and dates from those of musical syntax and structure.  Both
disciplines likewise claim objectivity, the illusion of which is
possible only when the questions considered valid are limited to those
that can, in fact, be answered without qualification.  The ideology
of autonomy also informs the conventional musical reception of
the &lsquo;music lover&rsquo; who listens to music precisely to withdraw from the
real world and to experience what is taken to be authentic
subjectivity.&rdquo; Richard Leppert and Susan McClary, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo;

Dreyfus calls &rdquo;objectivism,&ldquo; and what Kerman calls &rdquo;positivism,&ldquo; (he
speaks often of the impact of &rdquo;modernism&ldquo; on musical studies, but
always in a narrower sense of a phase of compositional history) are
faces that bear a strong family resemblance to one another.  They have
been put from time to time upon a conception of knowing that has had a
continuous life virtually throughout the history of Western culture:
the insistence upon the separation of the knower from the known as
a condition of knowledge and the corollary disqualification of the
subjective self from participation of knowing&mdash;the depersonalization
of knowledge.&rdquo;  Leo Treitler, &ldquo;Review: Joseph Kerman, <i>Contemplating

thus take on meaning.&ldquo;  Gary Tomlinson, &ldquo;The Web of Culture: A Context
for Musicology,&rdquo; <i>Nineteenth-Century Music</i> 7/3 (1984): 353.  Nicholas
Cook comes to similar conclusions, &ldquo;the theory of music is grounded in
the experience of the individual, and for this reason objectivity is
neither a feasible nor a desirable aim.&rdquo;  Nicholas Cook, <i>Music
Imagination and Culture</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990): 243.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">As Treitler puts it, &ldquo;The claim for certainty is no more than a

be no perfect reading of any text, be it archival, theoretical, or

intellectual terrors of a world without definitive, authoritative
readings, and that we develop an intellectual practice appropriate to
that world.&rdquo; Suzanne G. Cusick, &ldquo;Communication,&rdquo; <i>Journal of the

works (or anything else) outside of a cultural context.  It is only a
question of whether we opt for a limited and limiting discourse, a

assumptions, other aspirations and fears.&rdquo; Tomlinson, &ldquo;The Web of

114&ndash;138.  These essays and others are published in <i>Naturalizing
Epistemology</i> ed. Hilary Kornblith (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1985).</div><div id="fndiv39" class="flyoverdiv">According to Quine, &ldquo;Likening me to Bradley, Cresswell saddles me
with a realm of reified experience or appearance set over against an
inscrutable reality.  My naturalistic view is unlike that.  I have
forces from real external objects impinging on our nerve endings, and
I have us acquiring sentences about real objects partly through
conditioning to those excitations and partly through complex relations
of sentences to sentences.&rdquo;  Quine, &ldquo;Responses,&rdquo; in <i>Theories and
Things</i>, 181.</div><div id="fndiv40" class="flyoverdiv">According to Quine, &ldquo;The proper role of experience or surface
irritations is as a basis not for truth but for warranted belief.&rdquo;  He
adds, &ldquo;If empiricism is construed as a theory of truth, then what
Davidson imputes to it as a third dogma is rightly imputed and rightly
renounced.  Empiricism as a theory of truth thereupon goes by the
board, and good riddance.  As a theory of evidence, however,
empiricism remains with us, minus indeed the two old dogmas.&rdquo;  Quine,
&ldquo;On the Very Idea of a Third Dogma,&rdquo; in <i>Theories and Things</i>, 39.</div><div id="fndiv41" class="flyoverdiv">Quine, &ldquo;Two Dogmas of Empiricism,&rdquo; in <i>From a Logical Point of View</i>, 42.</div><div id="fndiv42" class="flyoverdiv">For example, Quine claims that cultural relativism is inherently
self-refuting: &ldquo;Truth, says the cultural relativist, is culture bound.
But if it were, then he, within his own culture, ought to see his own
culture-bound truth as absolute. He cannot proclaim cultural
relativism without rising above it, and he cannot rise above it
without giving it up.&rdquo;  Quine, &ldquo;On Empirically Equivalent Systems of
the World,&rdquo; <i>Erkenntnis</i> 9 (1975) : 327&ndash;328.</div><div id="fndiv43" class="flyoverdiv">Quine, &ldquo;Five Milestones of Empiricism,&rdquo; in <i>Theories and Things</i>, 71.</div><div id="fndiv44" class="flyoverdiv">For discussions of naturalized aesthetics, see Douglas Dempster,
&ldquo;Aesthetic Experience and Psychological Definitions of Art,&rdquo; <i>Journal
of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i> 44/2 (1985) :153&ndash;165, and
&ldquo;Renaturalizing Aesthetics,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i>
51/3 (1993): 351&ndash;361.</div><div id="fndiv45" class="flyoverdiv">For extensive discussion of these points, see Matthew Brown and
Douglas Dempster, &ldquo;The Scientific Image of Music Theory,&rdquo; <i>Journal of
Music Theory</i> 33 (1989) : 65&ndash;106 and &ldquo;Evaluating Music Theories and
Analyses,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 35 (1991): 247&ndash;279.</div><div id="fndiv46" class="flyoverdiv">Kitcher, <i>The Advancement of Science</i>, 9.</div><div id="fndiv47" class="flyoverdiv">See, for example, Harold Bloom, <i>The Anxiety of Influence</i> (New
York: Oxford University Press, 1973) and <i>A Map of Misreading</i> (New
York: Oxford University Press, 1975).</div><div id="fndiv48" class="flyoverdiv">According to Bloom, &ldquo;To live, the poet must <i>misinterpret</i> the
father, by the crucial act of misprision, which is the re-writing of
the father.&rdquo; See Bloom, <i>A Map of Misreading</i>, 19.</div><div id="fndiv49" class="flyoverdiv">Bloom refers to these ratios as follows&mdash;Clinamen, Tessera,
Kenosis, Daemonization, Askesis, and Apophrades.</div><div id="fndiv50" class="flyoverdiv">According to Bloom, &ldquo;Nietzsche and Freud are, so far as I can
tell, the prime influences upon the theory of influence presented in
this book. . . . Freud&rsquo;s investigations of the mechanisms of defense and
their ambivalent functionings provide the clearest analogues I have
found for the revisionary ratios that govern intra-poetic relations.&rdquo;
See Bloom, <i>The Anxiety of Influence</i>, 8.</div><div id="fndiv51" class="flyoverdiv">According to Taruskin, &ldquo;if similarity is evidence of influence,
but dissimilarity can be evidence of a stronger influence; if a poet&rsquo;s
direct allusion, not to mention his open assent or avowal, can be
evidence of his susceptibility, but the absence of an allusion and his
denial can be evidence of stronger susceptibility&mdash;then just what can
disprove the theory?  Nothing can: as a theory it is breezily
&rdquo;verificationist,&ldquo; and if it pretended to scientific status it would
be laughed right out of court.&rdquo;  Taruskin, &ldquo;Review,&rdquo; 119.  The charge
of solipsism is leveled by Suresh Raval in <i>Metacriticism</i> (Athens,
Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1981) : 170.</div><div id="fndiv52" class="flyoverdiv">See, for example, Karl Popper, <i>Conjectures and Refutations</i> (New
York: Basic Books, 1962), &ldquo;Replies to my critics,&rdquo; in <i>The Philosophy
of Karl Popper</i> ed. P. A.  Schlipp (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court Books,
1974): 961&ndash;1197, Adolf Grunbaum&rsquo;s <i>The Foundations of Psychoanalysis:
A Philosophical Critique</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press,
1984) and its sequel <i>Validation in the Clinical Theory of
Psychoanalysis.</i> A Study in the Philosophy of Psychoanalysis
Psychological Issues 61 (Madison CT: International Universities Press,
Inc. 1993). For extensive discussion of Grunbaum&rsquo;s views, see
<i>Behaviorial and Brain Science</i> 9 (1986).  For other general surveys
about the status of Freudian theory, see Sidney Hook ed.,
<i>Psychoanalysis, Scientific Method, and Philosophy</i> (New Brunswick,
N. J.: Transaction Publishers, 1990), and Richard Wollheim and James
Hopkins, <i>Philosophical Essays on Freud</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1982).</div><div id="fndiv53" class="flyoverdiv">The bibliography in this area is enormous.  For useful overviews,
see Michelene Chi, Robert Glaser, and Marshall J. Farred., <i>The Nature
of Expertise</i> (Hillsdale, N. J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., 1988) and
K. Anders Ericsson and Jacqui Smith ed., <i>Toward a General Theory of
Expertise</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991).</div><div id="fndiv54" class="flyoverdiv">Robert Gjerdingen, &ldquo;With respect to the harmonic and
voice-leading aspects of classical music, an early proponent of a type
of schema theory was the great Austrian theorist Heinrich Schenker.
He maintained that in the work of the masters the organization of
harmony and voice leading was guided by a high-level schema termed the
<i>Ursatz</i> or &lsquo;fundamental structure.&rsquo;&rdquo; See Robert Gjerdingen, <i>The
Classic Turn of Phrase: Music and the Psychology of Convention</i>
(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988): 23.</div><div id="fndiv55" class="flyoverdiv">See Nicholas Cook, &ldquo;The Perception of Large-Scale Tonal Closure,&rdquo;
<i>Music Perception</i> 5/2 (1987) : 197&ndash;206.  Cook asked a group of
undergraduate music majors to judge the degree of completion and long
range coherence of tonally closed and tonally open versions of six
pieces.  He found that, for pieces lasting over a minute in length,
the students were divided almost evenly between those who preferred
the closed to the open one.  He concluded that music theories which
emphasize long range tonal connections are much more appropriate as
models of composer, rather than of listener, psychology.</div><div id="fndiv56" class="flyoverdiv">Matthew Brown, Douglas Dempster, and Dave Headlam, &ldquo;The &#x266f;IV/&#x266d;V
