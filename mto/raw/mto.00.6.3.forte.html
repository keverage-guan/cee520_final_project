<p style="text-align: center"><b><a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php" name="Dubiel">Joseph Dubiel, &ldquo;Analysis, Description, and What Really Happens&rdquo;</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[1] Response by Allen Forte</b></p>

<p>[1.1] I find Professor Dubiel&rsquo;s paper original and thought-provoking. I only
wish I could say that I agree with his idea of what I will call concept
formulation, but I am sure he will acknowledge that in this instance, as in many
others in life, there is, as they say, room for disagreement, and I hope that he
will not be offended if I express mine rather directly, given the restrictions
on time under which we are all operating this afternoon.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.2">1.2</a>] Let me begin by saying that I, personally, have never thought that the
purpose of what Prof. Dubiel calls received theory was to tell anyone how to
hear music. His anonymous quotation, however, demonstrates that others do&mdash;in
particular, those who partake of a teleological viewpoint.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.3">1.3</a>] Prof. Dubiel describes teleological analysis as analysis that purports
to explain how a musical event should be heard, why it occurs, and why its prior
history leads inevitably to its later history. I&rsquo;m not sure that all
&ldquo;received analysis&rdquo; does this, but perhaps many analysts have been
guilty of unquestioningly accepting a teleological concept of this kind. Without
intending to dwell on this subject, it seems to me that a teleology is
indigenous to tonal music&mdash;for example, the concept of harmonic progression,
which is goal-directed, especially in its purest form, the circle of fifths. And
even Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s description of his experience of the key succession in the
Schumann movement involves a teleology, namely, the notion of syntactic harmonic
succession.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.4">1.4</a>] Nevertheless, in Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s view, teleological analysis does not
qualify as a basis for &ldquo;sharp, attractive, useful concepts for grasping our
experience of music&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#17">Dubiel 17</a>]. I can certainly see that a teleological approach to
the analysis of music may be completely inappropriate in some repertoires,
especially in music of the rapidly disappearing 20th century, and to that extent
I agree with his view.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.5">1.5</a>] I come now to my two main objections to the propositions Prof. Dubiel
puts forth in his paper. The first concerns his interpretation of received
theory. Music theory, and American music theory in particular, seems to me to
concern itself primarily with the explanation of and speculation about musical
structures and with analytical applications, with analysis broadly construed, to
a variety of repertoires. In my view, it is not basically a didactic endeavor.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.6">1.6</a>] Second, I find the comparison of the concept-formulation idea with the
wide range of achievements of American music theory&mdash; much of which is (forgive
me) formal in nature&mdash;at best inapt. If we were to accept Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s
recommendation <nobr>&ldquo;. . .</nobr> to give a very prominent place to the kind of
invention, communication, and understanding represented in my stories&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#11">Dubiel
11</a>], the character of the music theory endeavor would change radically.
Conference papers would tend to exclude rigorous analyses based upon new
theoretical ideas, there would be no room for speculative work in the area of
musical systems, and the discussion of issues in history of theory would become
irrelevant, or orthogonal, to borrow one of Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s adjectives. I cannot
see what future that holds for scholarly research in our field, nor do I see
significant pedagogical applications at any level.</p>
<p>[<a name="1.7">1.7</a>] Probably this dire prediction, which was intended to raise the level of
rhetoric in order to accentuate what I regard as important issues&mdash;probably that
prediction is exaggerated&mdash;but not, I believe, completely unreasonable. Is
there, then, a way of accommodating Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s strongly articulated
recommendation? Yes. According to Prof. Dubiel, it is possible that received
methods of analysis might lead to &ldquo;a distinct and interesting conception of
how a piece goes&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#17">Dubiel 17</a>]. Thus, his final recommendation: &ldquo;If we
theorists are as smart as we say we are, then we ought to make our
characteristic concern with musical structure, or whatever we call it,
recognizable as a source of stimulus for the invention and articulation of such
concepts&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#17">Dubiel 17</a>]. By such concepts he refers of course to the
exemplary phrases rendered by Brodbeck and Hasty. Still, if I read him
correctly, he recommends the creation of concepts as the central task of music
theory, and I cannot agree with that.</p>
<p>[1.8] Finally, despite the negative tone of my response, I want to say that
Prof. Dubiel has given us a good deal to think about, and I hope I have not
seemed to reject his idea lightly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[2] Joseph Dubiel replies:</b></p>

        <p>[<a name="2.1">2.1</a>] I appreciate the conviction and frankness of Professor Forte&rsquo;s
        response, yet I find that it confronts my ideas only obliquely. One
        reason for this, I suspect, is a difference of values between him and me
        that is considerably more extensive than the specific matter of my talk.
        Another reason, certainly, is a pattern of misunderstanding that occurs
        at several levels: I propose that theorists&rsquo; present range of operation
        be <i>expanded</i>, through our adoption of ideas or methods <i>in
        addition to</i> those that are now predominant, and he responds as
        though I have proposed to <i>eliminate</i> what is familiar and <i>replace</i>
        it with something new. When he misreads me in this way, he naturally
        finds my suggestions disturbing&mdash;so would I! I can&rsquo;t promise that he
        will be any less upset by what I actually say; but, for what it&rsquo;s worth,
        I will try to clarify.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.2">2.2</a>] The most easily identified (and rectified) instance of this
        pattern is Professor Forte&rsquo;s claim that, &ldquo;in Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s view,
        teleological analysis does not qualify as a basis for &lsquo;sharp,
        attractive, useful concepts for grasping our experience of music&rsquo;&rdquo;
        [<a href="#1.4">1.4</a>, in part quoting <a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#17">Dubiel
        17</a>]. No: in my view, teleology already <i>is</i>
        a sharp, useful, attractive concept for grasping our experience of
        music&mdash;when our experience happens to be of teleology. Whoever first
        thought of saying, of a suitable passage of music, that it sounded as
        though various events in the passage led to and followed from other
        events, had a great idea, one that has obviously caught on and proven
        susceptible to further application and elaboration. But of course it
        isn&rsquo;t the only such idea we need; and we&rsquo;ll need to keep devising more,
        as long as we keep hearing more different pieces going more different
        ways.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.3">2.3</a>] It is surprising that this is such a big point for Professor
        Forte, because, as far as I can tell, we agree completely on the (hardly
        radical) proposition that some musical passages proceed teleologically
        and some don&rsquo;t. For some reason, he devotes half of his response to
        warding off the assumption that he might be an inflexible teleologist [<a href="#1.2">1.2</a>], defending the attribution of teleology to some music
        [<a href="#1.3">1.3</a>], and
        mistakenly attributing an obviously silly view to me [<a href="#1.4">1.4</a>]; he needn&rsquo;t do any
        of this on my account.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.4">2.4</a>] If anything, Professor Forte ought to be on my side in trying
        to help the people I&rsquo;m trying to help, namely those who find the
        teleological model <i>so</i> impressive that they see a fundamental <i>methodological</i>
        difference between accounts of pieces in which the model is applied and
        ones in which it isn&rsquo;t. Look again at the quotation in my talk that
        defines analysis (as opposed to description) by reference to teleology [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#15">Dubiel
        15</a>]; it amounts to this: to analyze a piece <i>means</i> to show how its
        events are &ldquo;made necessary&rdquo; by earlier events and &ldquo;lead
        to&rdquo; later events. In that case, if you give an account of a piece
        as going that way, you are analyzing it; but if you give an account of a
        piece as <i>not</i> going that way (say, because you don&rsquo;t hear it going
        that way!), then you are <i>not</i> analyzing it (although you may be
        doing something less, such as &ldquo;merely describing&rdquo; it). The
        main point of my talk is that I don&rsquo;t find this distinction altogether
        rational. But (like many not altogether rational ideas) it&rsquo;s not
        uninfluential: people really do go around talking about minimalist
        music, or Morton Feldman&rsquo;s music, as &ldquo;unanalyzable&rdquo;; and,
        probably more insidiously, people bend their analytical models of less
        obviously refractory music in the direction of what they have learned to
        think are the methodologically most impressive claims they can make,
        namely claims of implication and inevitability, when they could
        recognize more possibilities and exercise freer choice. (An adequate
        treatment of the analysis-explanation-teleology series would require an
        extensive discussion of explanation; but since this is not an issue
        between Professor Forte and me, I will not go into it.)</p>
<p>[<a name="2.5">2.5</a>] Since I have just summarized it, I should point out that this
        particular account of this particular issue&mdash;that is, the
        differentiation of analysis from description on the basis of
        explanation, which is most characteristically teleological&mdash;is what I
        call the &ldquo;received view&rdquo; in my talk, and it is the <i>only</i>
        thing that I ever call &ldquo;received.&rdquo; There is no such thing as
        &ldquo;what Prof. Dubiel calls received theory&rdquo; [<a href="#1.2">1.2</a>]; what
        Professor Forte calls &ldquo;received theory&rdquo; [<a href="#1.2">1.2</a>,
<a href="#1.5">1.5</a>] or, at
        times, &ldquo;received analysis&rdquo; [<a href="#1.3">1.3</a>, <a href="#1.7">1.7</a>] is <i>his</i> issue. I take
        him to mean by this the music-theoretical status quo, broadly
        understood, perhaps with an emphasis on the &ldquo;formal,&rdquo; a
        characteristic he seems to feel he has to defend against me [<a href="#1.6">1.6</a>]. In my
        talk, this isn&rsquo;t even a subject&mdash;let alone one toward which I take a
        hostile attitude. If anything, my attitude is one of indifference.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.6">2.6</a>] And not even indifference, exactly: it&rsquo;s rather that I don&rsquo;t
        have any attitude at all toward formal, systematic analysis as such&mdash;I
        don&rsquo;t think that this is even the right sort of thing to have an
        attitude toward. I don&rsquo;t care whether a claim about music is presented
        formally or informally, systematically or unsystematically, as long as I
        can tell what experiences of what music are supposed to correlate with
        it. I value formality and systematicity when they help to clarify the
        implications of a theoretical claim for our hearing; I value informality
        and unsystematicity when they help to clarify the implications of a
        theoretical claim for our hearing. (I would cite my writings as
        evidence that I am committed to mobility along the methodological
        continuum, not to any fixed point on it.)</p>
<p>[<a name="2.7">2.7</a>] The two stories in my talk give accounts of pieces that are
        unusually, even exaggeratedly, informal and unsystematic (especially in
        the compressed forms in which I present them). It is of course part of
        my point that these are not the characteristics of style and method that
        theorists are in the habit of esteeming, at least in professional
        contexts. But (obviously, I thought) it is no part of my point to
        recommend these &ldquo;untheoretical&rdquo; characteristics <i>as against</i>
        their opposites; my point is to demonstrate that these characteristics
        are no impediment to getting the job done&mdash;the job being to help us get
        a better grasp of a wider range of musical experience. It is this
        conception of the job that I want to emphasize above everything else in
        my talk. Understanding what we hear is the reason to do music theory&mdash;
        isn&rsquo;t it? And if so, then it should set our standards of methodological
        adequacy, and of empirical and interpretive accomplishment&mdash;what else
        could?</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.8">2.8</a>] Professor Forte&rsquo;s response to this misunderstands it on the
        pattern to which I have already referred. I say &ldquo;Look: besides what
        we already recognize as valuable, here&rsquo;s something else that can
        work&mdash;it&rsquo;s happened to me&rdquo;; he reacts as though I have made some
        threat against what is recognized. In his zero-sum nightmare,
        &ldquo;conference papers would tend to exclude rigorous analyses based
        upon new theoretical ideas, there would be no room for speculative work
        in the area of musical systems,&rdquo; and so on, if a &ldquo;prominent
        place&rdquo; were given to &ldquo;the kind of invention, communication,
        and understanding represented in my stories&rdquo; [<a href="#1.6">1.6</a>, in part quoting
        <a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#11">
        Dubiel 11</a>]. The invention of models of pieces that <i>might or might not
        be</i> teleological; communication of them that <i>might or might not be</i>
        formal; and understanding of them that is concerned above all with their
        relation to musical experience&mdash;exactly <i>what</i> would this leave
        &ldquo;no room&rdquo; for?</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.9">2.9</a>] The only thing I can think of would be analysis that could not
        be connected to specific ways of hearing specific passages. And, now
        that I think of it, good riddance (although getting rid of things is not
        my project, and in real life I would be against discarding anything
        until a strenuous sympathetic effort had been made to work out any
        audible significance that its author may have failed to articulate). But
        in any event I see no reason to expect success and failure by this
        standard to be anything but randomly distributed with respect to (in)formality
        or (un)systematicity. If I wanted to twit Professor Forte, I could
        accuse <i>him</i> of a pessimism about the auditory relevance of his
        &ldquo;received analysis&rdquo; that I would never dream of entertaining.
        This might not be accurate as a representation of his thinking (he
        offers no alternate account of the relation of analysis to hearing, if
        he in fact doesn&rsquo;t like mine), but we are invited to imagine the worst
        by his horror story. He concedes this scenario to be &ldquo;probably . .
        . exaggerated&rdquo; [<a href="#1.7">1.7</a>]; but the concession only relieves him of the
        responsibility to defend this fantasy in the terms in which he presents
        it. We are still left with an image contrived to alarm us.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.10">2.10</a>] I cannot even tell whether Professor Forte thinks of himself
        as disclosing a perverse intention of mine, or merely pointing out the
        unintended implications of an innocent but ill-conceived fancy. (Am I a
        pyromaniac, or just playing with fire?) Since he has opened this larger
        question, I shall conclude by saying what I think would be the
        consequences for the music theory of the methodologically inclusive,
        experience oriented view of analysis expressed in my talk. I should
        specify that I am reluctant to claim it as <i>my</i> view, because I
        know I am not alone in holding it, or even in asserting it; accordingly,
        its influence is not all in the future&mdash;but for simplicity&rsquo;s sake I
        shall write as though it were.</p>
        <p>[<a name="2.11">2.11</a>] In that golden age, we theorists will hold ourselves
        responsible to tell our readers, as well as we can, the audible
        significance of our representations&mdash;what ways of hearing what music are
        to count as confirming (or disconfirming) our theoretical claims.
        Theoretical work will be considered ill-formed when it elides or bungles
        this crucial step&mdash;ill-formed in the only relevant sense, namely not
        formed so as to facilitate experiential evaluation. The evasion of such
        evaluation is the only trait that will be stigmatized as a lack of
        &ldquo;rigor&rdquo; (although unbendingness will not rank as high as
        flexibility, responsiveness, imagination, and solicitude toward
        experience among the qualities for which we will commend one another).
        Older theoretical work, which may or may not have been executed with the
        ideal of auditory relevance uppermost, may have to be reread and
        reevaluated&mdash;as normally happens when the interests of a disciplinary
        community evolve. Some of this work will reward such reading, richly and
        immediately, and some, initially more obscure, will be found to have
        musical significance beyond what its authors managed to place in the
        foreground. Some older work may resist such explication, but even then
        this work will have something to teach us, as little as we may wish to
        emulate it: we will have at least the historical project of figuring out
        what its authors were trying to do and why. If our predecessors turn out
        ever to have maintained something other than musical experience as their
        topic of investigation, or something other than efficacy at rendering
        and explaining experience as a methodological mandate, it will be
        mind-stretching to find out what it was. But our main business as
        theorists of music will be elaborating, exchanging, and trying out
        vividly imagined, diversely formulated accounts of what and how we hear.
        What&rsquo;s scary about that?</p>
        
<p style="text-align: center"><b>[3] Allen Forte responds again</b></p>

<p>[3.1] Despite the occasional gestures of bonhomie and the expressions of
generosity in support of a broad view of music theory and analysis, one that
would include more traditional activities, in the concluding statement of his
reply to my response Prof. Dubiel is unable to relinquish the narrow conception
of our field that was so evident in his original NECMT paper but that has been
modified by numerous additions and new formulations in his reply. I shall return
to this major issue at the end of my response.</p>
<p>[3.2] Indeed, many of Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s clarifications, amplifications, and
especially criticisms of my response are written as though they are based upon
statements made in his original NECMT paper. If only they had been there. Right
at the outset of his reply he asserts that I have misread him, and that I have
responded &ldquo;as though I have proposed to <i>eliminate</i> what is familiar and
<i>replace</i> it with something new&rdquo; [<a href="#2.1">2.1</a>].</p>
<p>[3.3] Denying this intention, Prof. Dubiel writes &ldquo;I propose that
theorists&rsquo; present range of operation be <i>expanded</i>, through our adoption of
ideas or methods <i>in addition to</i> those that are now predominant <nobr>. . .</nobr> &rdquo; [<a href="#2.1">2.1</a>].
But where does he say this in the NECMT paper? On the contrary, he makes a
number of statements that support my original interpretation, forming a
consistent and contradictory thread, for example, in the following categorical
statement: &ldquo;The received theory [by which he I assume he designates
currently standard music theory in general] isn&rsquo;t antithetical to these
experiences [related in the preceding two &lsquo;stories,&rsquo; which demonstrate epiphanic
concepts], it&rsquo;s orthogonal to them&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#12">Dubiel
12</a>]. Now, the mathematical term &ldquo;orthogonal&rdquo; means
&ldquo;right-angled&rdquo; or &ldquo;statistically independent,&rdquo; which,
construed metaphorically, signifies something like &ldquo;tangential,&rdquo;
&ldquo;incidental,&rdquo; or &ldquo;peripheral.&rdquo; It certainly does not support
the idea of &ldquo;<i>in addition to</i>,&rdquo; which Prof. Dubiel accuses me of
misreading.</p>
<p>[3.4] Here is another instance: &ldquo;I want to show you how a certain way of
thinking about analysis and certain familiar ways of learning about music are
mutually irrelevant; and, faced with that situation, I want to recommend keeping
faith with our actual experience and practices, and letting an imposed
methodological scheme go by the boards&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#2">Dubiel
2</a>]. Doesn&rsquo;t the phrase &ldquo;letting <nobr>. . .</nobr> go by the boards&rdquo; signify
rejection? If this statement implies rejection of &ldquo;methodology,&rdquo; as I
believe it does, then it excludes much significant music theoretic- analytical
work, such as Schenker&rsquo;s, and, more recently, neo- Riemannian harmonic theory,
which I would say embeds a &ldquo;methodology.&rdquo; From these and other
statements, which are not contradicted elsewhere in the NECMT paper, I conclude
that Dubiel&rsquo;s complaint in [<a href="#2.1">2.1</a>] concerning my misreading is
not supported. I read what he wrote and not what he didn&rsquo;t write.</p>
<p>[3.5] Yet another strand of the rejection thread occurs at the end of his
discussion of the two pieces, the anomalies (my word) of which had been of
concern to him, but were laid to rest by the concepts Hasty and Brodbeck
provided. Dubiel then considers the possibility that someone might &ldquo;tell me
how these pieces actually did proceed teleologically<nobr>. . . .&rdquo;</nobr> In that case,
he declaims: <nobr>&ldquo;. . .</nobr> I am convinced that any meta-analytical framework that
would even suggest that we say this is a framework that we&rsquo;d be better off
without&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#15">Dubiel 15</a>]. I submit that
this categorical statement and others like it contradict the idea of broad
inclusion that he expressed in [<a href="#2.1">2.1</a>]. And in [<a href="#2.11">2.11</a>],
at the end of his reply to my response, we see what the final determination is
with respect to those older, &ldquo;received&rdquo; views of music theory and
analysis.</p>
<p>[3.6] Moreover, Prof. Dubiel disputes my statement that in his view
&ldquo;teleological analysis does not qualify as a basis for &lsquo;sharp, attractive,
useful concepts for grasping our experience of music&rsquo;,&rdquo; whereas in [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#15">Dubiel
15</a>], after introducing &ldquo;teleological&rdquo; as the primary
characteristic of analysis through an anonymous quotation, he rejects the
teleological approach, stating, &ldquo;And of course that&rsquo;s exactly the view
that, in these two cases, I got over<nobr>. . . .&rdquo;</nobr> From this and the following
statement I conclude that teleological analysis did not engender the kind of
concept (which in [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#17">Dubiel 17</a>] he
characterizes as &ldquo;sharp, attractive, useful&rdquo;) represented by the Hasty
and Brodbeck extracts.</p>
<p>[3.7] I regret the defensive posture I have taken at the beginning of my
response, but I felt that it was necessary in order to remedy flaws in the
discourse, perhaps engendered by Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s haste in preparing a reply to my
NECMT response and consequent detachment from his original paper. Or perhaps he
wished to correct by amplification certain omissions in the original paper that
were due to the time restrictions imposed by the NECMT format. In that case he
should have informed the reader that there are significant differences between
what he actually said at NECMT 2000 and what he implies he said there.</p>
<p>[3.8] In [<a href="#2.2">2.2</a>] Dubiel also upbraids me for devoting
(&ldquo;for some reason&rdquo;) a significant portion of my response to the issue
of teleology, a term that he introduced. The &ldquo;reason&rdquo; was the central
role he accorded it in his NECMT paper, whereupon I took the occasion to
ruminate, and to include reflections on my own position, since I had not given
much thought to this issue, and had been inspired by that feature of the Dubiel
paper&mdash;and by others, as I indicated at the end of my NECMT response.</p>
<p>[3.9] Again, in [<a href="#2.4">2.4</a>] Dubiel brings up the teleological
attribute of analysis, amplifying his NECMT paper to assert that if an account
of a piece shows how its events &ldquo;made necessary&rdquo; by earlier events and
&ldquo;lead to&rdquo; later events, then it qualifies as analysis. Otherwise not.
Thus, he places in motion yet another dualism of which there are many in his
reply, analysis and non-analysis (my terms), a dichotomy that was fundamental to
his NECMT presentation. In his MTO response he writes: &ldquo;The main point of
my talk is that I don&rsquo;t find this distinction altogether rational.&rdquo;
Frankly, I don&rsquo;t know how to interpret this, especially since this is but one of
what he has called his main points. Perhaps he is leaving the door open for
teleological analysis, but only if it fulfills the requirements set forth in [<a href="#2.11">2.11</a>].
In the NECMT paper, however, he takes a dim, if not a completely negative view
of analysis, preferring what in my response I dubbed &ldquo;concept
formulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[3.10] Prof. Dubiel is fond of the term &ldquo;received,&rdquo; using it more
often than he indicates in his reply (&ldquo;received account [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#1">Dubiel
1</a>], &rdquo;received distinction [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#11">Dubiel
11</a>], &ldquo;received view&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#2">Dubiel 2</a>,
<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#12">12</a>, <a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#15">15</a>]
and &ldquo;received theory&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#12">Dubiel 12</a>],
which he so adamantly denies using.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>He does not, however, use the term &ldquo;received analysis,&rdquo; and I
apologize for imputing that usage to him.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.11] Still on the issue of what is &ldquo;received&rdquo; and what is not,
Dubiel writes: &ldquo;what Professor Forte calls &lsquo;received theory&rsquo; [Forte 1.2,
1.5] or, at times, &lsquo;received analysis&rsquo; [Forte 1.3, 1.7] is <i>his</i> issue. I
take him to mean by this the music-theoretical status quo<nobr>, . . . ,</nobr> perhaps with
an emphasis on the &lsquo;formal,&rsquo; a characteristic he seems to feel he has to defend
against me [Forte 1.6]&rdquo; [<a href="#2.5">2.5</a>]. I acknowledge that I am
defensive about the formal aspect of music theory and that this is not an issue
Dubiel brought up <i>explicitly</i> in his paper. It is, however, relevant to
this discourse, and at this point I wish to pose a question, one that Dubiel
would probably regard as heretical: Is the sole purpose of music theory to
explain &ldquo;pieces&rdquo;? I say &ldquo;heretical&rdquo; because it violates what
I would call his axiomatic criterion of audition, which is that the purpose of
music theory is to explain what we hear. I leave aside the questions of how
&ldquo;what we hear&rdquo; is determined, as well as how to account for individual
variations in that regard, in order to make an observation based upon simple
fact: many of the venerable figures in the history of music theory&mdash;Boethius,
for example&mdash;would be disqualified as music theorists were Dubiel&rsquo;s axiomatic
criterion of audition to be applied indiscriminately.</p>
<p>[3.12] Further, on the topic of audition as it relates to music theory,
Dubiel reports that he transformed Hasty&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;a constantly
evanescent beauty&rdquo; into immediate audibility, without Hasty (or Brodbeck)
&ldquo;letting me in on some kind of structure that underlay what was
audible&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#13">Dubiel 13</a>]. I find the
reality of this occurrence difficult to grasp, that is, the proceeding
instantaneously from a verbal description to an auditory image. And, once more,
the throw-away phrase &ldquo;some kind of structure that underlay&rdquo; strongly
and negatively refers to one of those &ldquo;ideas or methods <nobr>. . .</nobr> that are now
predominant&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.dubiel.php#13">Dubiel 13</a>], namely, I
assume, Schenkerian theory and analysis.</p>
<p>[3.13] In [<a href="#2.7">2.7</a>] Prof. Dubiel again introduces something
that was absent from his NECMT paper, namely, his willingness to accommodate
formal or systematic music theory if it gets the job done, &ldquo;the job being
to help us get a better grasp of a wider range of musical experience.&rdquo; He
continues: &ldquo;It is this conception of the job that I want to emphasize above
everything else in my talk.&rdquo; Sounds good to me, as long as the &ldquo;range
of musical experience&rdquo; is broad enough to include intellectual experience
that may not relate directly to the audition of individual pieces.</p>
<p>[3.14] In [<a href="#2.8">2.8</a>] Dubiel again complains that I misread him.
But as I have set forth in my earlier comments, his ecumenical inclusion of
analysis, presumably of the traditional type, was not made explicit, giving rise
to the &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; scenario I concocted in order to frighten readers.
Surely, Prof. Dubiel, you can forgive a little hyperbolic rhetoric. After all,
you have made effective use of it in both of your contributions to this forum.</p>
<p>[3.15] There is still more on my &ldquo;horror story&rdquo; in [<a href="#2.9">2.9</a>].
In large part I have answered this in my comments above, which suggest a partial
answer to Dubiel&rsquo;s comment here to the effect that I offer &ldquo;no alternate
account of the relation of analysis to hearing<nobr>. . . . &rdquo;</nobr> This is of course a
very large question, and it would be foolish even to attempt to answer it in
this context, particularly since there are others far better qualified to cope
with the attendant complexities than I.</p>
<p>[<a name="3.16">3.16</a>] In Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s [<a href="#2.10">2.10</a>] we
encounter the synthesis that was lacking in his NECMT paper, as he says that he
will conclude by setting forth &ldquo;the consequences for the music theory of
the methodologically inclusive, experience-oriented view of analysis expressed
in his talk.&rdquo; I failed and still fail to find the &ldquo;methodologically
inclusive&rdquo; part in Dubiel&rsquo;s NECMT paper, but perhaps I am misunderstanding
the syntax here. Is &ldquo;methodologically&rdquo; an adverb that modifies the
adjective &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo;?</p>
<p>[3.17] The golden age! What should we call what is described in [<a href="#2.11">2.11</a>]
of Dubiel&rsquo;s reply? The New Music Theory? Whatever it is called, we must all
remove our hats or, for those who do not wear hats, figurative hats, as the
brave young theorists march past bearing trophies of &ldquo;older theoretical
work&rdquo; that did not measure up to &ldquo;Prof. Dubiel&rsquo;s ideal of auditory
relevance.&rdquo; Who will have determined that failure? Why, &ldquo;the interests
of the disciplinary community,&rdquo; of course. (Here I pause to savor the
double meaning of &ldquo;disciplinary&rdquo; in this context.) Why have these older
theories been subjected to disciplinary rejection? Because they were &ldquo;not
formed so as to facilitate experiential valuation.&rdquo; Who determines whether
they were not so formed? Those who understand what &ldquo;experiential
evaluation&rdquo; is. The reader will kindly excuse this catechism, but I have
found it necessary in order to avoid yet another accusation from Prof. Dubiel to
the effect that I have misread him.</p>
<p>[3.18] To close in a more serious vein, my own vision of the future of music
theory is not as neat as Dubiel&rsquo;s. I am not as certain as he is about what
&ldquo;our main business as theorists of music will be.&rdquo; At the present time
there are many intellectual activities that impinge upon our small field, and
many of these will exert influence. This is not so new, of course. Of those that
were influential in the recent past, although they lack visibility at the
present time, I recall the information theory of the sixties, the phenomenology
work of my former student, the late Thomas Clifton, and the structural
linguistics of the seventies. In Dubiel&rsquo;s vision of the future, one of these
(Clifton&rsquo;s phenomenology) might be regarded as well formed&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure&mdash;while
the other two would certainly be subjected to &ldquo;figuring out what [their]
authors were trying to do and why&rdquo; [<a href="#2.11">2.11</a>], which is
presumably the last stage before final interment. In any event, the world of
music theory, according to Dubiel, is to consist of two communities: those whose
work facilitates &ldquo;experiential evaluation&rdquo; (I love that term) and
those whose work does not. None of his persuasive language and occasional
expressions of generosity toward those who might not agree with him conceal this
basically authoritarian point of view. And I do not say this to frighten anyone.
Prof. Dubiel has convinced me that that was a bad idea. It is just how I see it,
following, consistently, I hope, upon my charge from the folks at NECMT to
respond to the NECMT 2000 papers.</p>

Walk on the Wild
Side&rdquo;</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[4] Response by Allen Forte</b></p>

<p>[4.1] During my banquet address in Rochester at the 1987 celebration of the
tenth anniversary of the Society for Music Theory I said: &ldquo;What is most
striking to me is that the programs of the Society now exhibit a breadth of
interests that probably could not have been predicted when it began, but which
is to be encouraged.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>[<a name="4.2">4.2</a>] Prof. Hisama now tells us that a decade later a significant increase in
activities related to music theory began, activities that involved research and
publishing of various kinds centering upon music &ldquo;outside of the Western
European art music canon as well as the standard tonal and post-tonal repertoire&rdquo;
[<a href="mto.00.6.3.hisama.php#2">Hisama 2</a>]. From this she predicts career possibilities based upon
analytical involvement with this non-canonical music. All this is very exciting,
and I was impressed with the array of names Prof. Hisama invoked when
introducing the topic of professional potential (possibly leading to that summit
of academic achievement, tenure). Impressed is hardly adequate to describe my
reaction, which was momentarily vertiginous. And I must admit that out of the
list of names she presented as possible subjects of research on the non-canonic
side, I recognized only three, those of Sting, Mary Lou Williams, and Adam
Guettel. I am definitely running with the wrong crowd.</p>
<p>[4.3] Before I move along to a concluding and general comment on Prof.
Hisama&rsquo;s thoughtful and challenging paper, I would like to consider the term
&ldquo;canon&rdquo; that is tossed around so blithely these days. As a dedicated
sesquipedalian, I went to the Oxford English Dictionary to locate the entry
&ldquo;Canon.&rdquo; Here is what I found. Of the 14 definitions of the word in
the OED, number 4 seems closest to what I perceive as current usage: &ldquo;The
collection or list of books of the Bible accepted by the Christian Church as
genuine and inspired.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> 
Thus, the word is of religious origin. It is doctrinal in nature. I found myself
trying to imagine just how this information would be received by the
musicologists in Bob Jones University&rsquo;s Department of Music.</p>
<p>[4.4] I believe that the term canon is a recent arrival in the musicological
literature, perhaps introduced by some disgruntled scholar, possibly with
negative intent, since it implies permanence, immutability, and of course a
reverential attitude, not exactly attractive qualities to your average
post-modernist. At any event, it seems to be here to stay. When we use it as a
keyword in scholarly discourse, however, we would do well to be watchful.
Indeed, we might well pay heed to another meaning of canon, number 2c in the
OED: &ldquo;A standard of judgment or authority; a test, criterion, means of
discrimination.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>&nbsp; This
would certainly apply were one to allow an extension of the canonization process
to include new canons, if that is not a contradiction in terms. Allow me to
digress for a moment, however, to avoid possible misunderstanding. Just as Prof.
Hisama says she does not recommend &ldquo;that research on canonical composers
should [be] dispensed with&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.hisama.php#4">Hisama 4</a>],
I am not suggesting that research involving
non-canonical music be suspended, a suggestion that, in any event, would be
Chutzpah of the highest order. Quite the contrary. As I have indicated, we
should recognize that the canonization process is ongoing. We are all familiar
with instances, among the most visible of which is the music of the Beatles, now
fully transcribed and available in score form in a high-class binding. And of
course another, perhaps even more visible canonic corpus of music is the classic
American popular song repertoire, which comes from musical theater and movies
during the twenties, thirties, and forties.</p>
<p>[<a name="4.5">4.5</a>] Following the second definition of canon, it is clear that the
formation of new canons involves selection, which, in turn, requires criteria of
discrimination. Of course complex processes of selection are always in operation
in a vital art form such as music, and that is especially true in our often
bewilderingly complicated world of information dissemination. Clearly, as Prof.
Hisama indicates throughout her paper, a large part of the burden of selection,
from the scholarly vantage point at least, falls upon younger scholars, and I
hope, sincerely hope, that they bear in mind that second definition of canon. I
would also hope that job attainment leading to tenure is not a major motivation
for exploring music outside the canon, taking precedence over the intrinsic
interest of the musical artifact.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[5] Ellie M. Hisama replies</b></p>

        <p>[<a name="5.1">5.1</a>] After mentioning his 1987 SMT banquet address which noted the
        diversity of interests then exhibited by the Society, Prof. Forte
        writes: &ldquo;Prof. Hisama now tells us that a decade later a
        significant increase in activities related to music theory began,
        activities that involved research and publishing of various kinds
        centering upon music &lsquo;outside of the Western European art music canon as
        well as the standard tonal and post-tonal repertoire&rsquo;&rdquo; [<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>]. As
        the introduction to my paper states, my survey of developments in music
        theory takes 1997 as its starting point simply to avoid duplicating the
        efforts of papers presented at the 1997 SMT plenary session. It does not
        identify 1997 as a <i>beginning</i> in research activity on music
        outside of the Western art music canon. On the contrary, I would agree
        with Prof. Forte that the foundations of the discipline&rsquo;s present
        diversity are rooted in earlier work.</p>
        <p>[5.2] Prof. Forte continues: &ldquo;From this she predicts career
        possibilities based upon analytical involvement with this non-canonical
        music. All this is very exciting, and I was impressed with the array
        of names Prof. Hisama invoked when introducing the topic of professional
        potential (possibly leading to that summit of academic achievement,
        tenure)&rdquo; [<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>]. One of the purposes of my paper was to offer the
        perspective of someone who recently sought and obtained a tenure-track
        position in music theory. While I do not wish to present an unduly
        optimistic view of a job market that frequently requires graduate
        students to piece together adjunct teaching from multiple institutions
        to make ends meet or that sometimes forces newer scholars to leave the
        field altogether, I do believe that analytical work outside the Western
        art music canon is now becoming more widely accepted than it was ten
        years ago.</p>
        <p>[5.3] The discipline&rsquo;s increased interest in non-canonical music is
        underscored in Joelle Welling and Cynthia I. Gonzales&rsquo;s recent study of
        the music theory job market. Surveying advertisements for music theory
        jobs published in the College Music Society&rsquo;s Music Vacancy List from
        1985 to 1998, their article shows that the demand for applicants who
        could teach world music, jazz, and popular music in addition to theory
        courses rose sharply during the period 1994&ndash;1998. During this four-year
        period, world music was listed as a desired additional teaching area 12
        times as compared to five times over the nine-year period 1985&ndash;1994;
        jazz was listed as a desired teaching area 14 times over this four-year
        period in comparison to 18 times for the previous nine-year period; and
        popular music was listed as a desired teaching area seven times over the
        same four-year period in comparison to only two times during the
        previous nine-year period.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
        <p>[5.4] The choice of topic alone of course does not guarantee one a
        job interview, an offer, or quality analytical work. Prof. Forte raises
        the concern that the canons of the future may not be based upon
        discriminating criteria but upon the career possibilities they present.
        The current offerings of analytical work outside the canon eases this
        anxiety. I do not advocate choosing a topic based on what&rsquo;s currently
        marketable, and I sincerely hope that shoddy scholarship on bad music is
        not the wave of the future. Rather, I would encourage theorists who are
        attracted to repertories that remain little discussed and analyzed to
        pursue their interest and to bring to this music the same care with
        which they might approach a piece by Beethoven.</p>
        <p>[5.5] As most ABDs who have recently sought an academic position know
        all too well, the job market for music theorists is bleak. Welling and
        Gonzales&rsquo;s study showed that the average number of junior-level
        tenure-track jobs advertised in the Music Vacancy List from 1985 to 1998
        was 10.5 per academic year, with a low of 4 in 1988&ndash;89 and a high of 20
        in 1989&ndash;90.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
        With more than 10.5 applicants on the market in any given year, these
        statistics indicate that there are clearly not enough tenure-track jobs
        in music theory to go around.</p>
        <p>[5.6] Among the memorabilia preserved from my job search are several
        rejection letters that apologetically mentioned the number of
        applicants, which averaged 150 in the stack I collected. One of the
        lowest numbers of applicants for a job to which I applied was 107&mdash;these
        odds were positively heartening when compared to those of getting a
        one-year, non-renewable position at a liberal arts college in the South,
        which received a whopping 200 applications.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>[<a name="5.7">5.7</a>] Prof. Forte
concludes by voicing the hope that &ldquo;job attainment leading to tenure is not
a major motivation for exploring music outside the canon, taking precedence over
the intrinsic interest of the musical artifact&rdquo; [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>]. Like the
apprehension he expressed at the 1987 SMT meeting about &ldquo;overdiversification&rdquo;
(&ldquo;By fostering diversity<nobr>, . . .</nobr> the Society does run the risk of excessive
fragmentation&rdquo;), his concern is misplaced.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>Because Prof. Forte has not recently experienced first- hand the intense
competition for junior-level tenure- track jobs, he may not realize that these
days it is a practical rather than a crassly careerist measure to assess the
relationship between an area of research and one&rsquo;s chances of getting a job with
training in that area. Such matters do and should weigh heavily on the minds of
young scholars in the current market. Selecting an area of study in a music
doctoral program without considering its professional implications is simply not
an option unless one has independent means of support. We need to recognize the
present realities of the job market while selecting research topics of intrinsic
interest.</p>
<p>[5.8] Prof. Forte&rsquo;s invocation of tenure as &ldquo;that summit of
        academic achievement&rdquo; [<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>] led me to Cary Nelson and Stephen
        Watt&rsquo;s <i>Academic Keywords: A Devil&rsquo;s Dictionary for Higher Education</i>,
        which defines tenure as &ldquo;the expectation that a faculty member who
        has been through a probationary period and has passed a tenure review
        will remain employed until retirement, voluntary separation, or removal
        for cause.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup><sup>
</sup>To
        graduate students who hope to obtain a position more permanent than a
        teaching assistantship or an appointment as an adjunct, being employed
        for life may indeed seem like the summit of academic achievement.
        Whether one&rsquo;s research topic is Neo-Riemannian analysis of Wagner or
        timbre in Bikini Kill, tenure guarantees us the freedom to explore such
        topics and is not to be dismissed lightly, particularly by those who
        already have it.</p>
        
<p style="text-align: center"><b>[6] Allen Forte responds again</b></p>

<p>[6.1] I would like to begin by clarifying a minor issue: Prof. Hisama
misreads my observation concerning the &ldquo;significant increase in activities
related to music theory&rdquo; [<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>, referred to in <a href="#5.1">5.1</a>] a decade after my 1987 SMT banquet address. I did
not say that these activities began <i>only</i> a decade later, but simply wished to
connect the content of her present-day paper to my earlier forecast as a
verification and as a device for beginning my response. At any event, we are in
agreement as regards chronology, and I regret any misunderstanding that may have
ensued from the lack of precision in my prose.</p>
<p>[6.2] I do not dispute the growing interest in music outside the
&ldquo;canon,&rdquo; a term to the exegesis of which I devoted an inordinate
amount of time in my original response to Prof. Hisama&rsquo;s paper. At the same
time, I am gratified to see Prof. Hisama at least touch upon the issue of
quality that I raised, when she writes: &ldquo;We need to recognize the present
realities of the job market while selecting research topics of intrinsic
interest&rdquo; [<a href="#5.7">5.7</a>]. While my apprehension concerning &ldquo;excessive
fragmentation&rdquo; has decreased in the past thirteen years since the 1987 SMT
meeting, I still feel that as professionals we would do well to remain watchful
in that direction. By its traditions American music theory is a small field, one
that may not be able to accommodate unlimited diversification without
sacrificing some of its basic characteristics: primarily, the cultivation of
abstract theoretical concepts designed to illuminate specific repertoires of
music. Large-scale diversification in terms of identifiable repertories probably
belongs to our mother discipline, musicology, or to related disciplines, such as
ethnomusicology.</p>
<p>[6.3] With respect to the topic of diversification and the focus of research
activities, the Welling and Gonzales study, cited by Prof. Hisama, is relevant
because it dramatizes what many of us have known for a long time, namely, that
music theory still has a long way to go to achieve broad recognition in
academia, especially in smaller institutions where members of the music
department faculty, including those hired to teach &ldquo;theory,&rdquo; typically
teach in a wide variety of areas. In this regard I have had not first-hand, but
second-hand experience in connection with the four NEH Summer Seminars for
College Teachers I have directed, all of which were attended by extraordinarily
talented and, of necessity, diversified individuals. Prof. Hisama is right,
however, when she points out that I have &ldquo;not recently experienced
first-hand the intense competition for junior-level, tenure-track jobs&rdquo; [<a href="#5.7">5.7</a>], a rite of passage that for me exists, blessedly, only in the remote halls
of memory. Nevertheless, I continue to experience that competition second-hand,
through the many position-seeking Ph.D. recipients, with each of whom I have
spent several congenial years in a pedagogical and advisory capacity. Therefore
I am sympathetic to Prof. Hisama&rsquo;s sensitive statement that &ldquo;these days it
is a practical rather than a crassly careerist measure to assess the
relationship between an area of research and one&rsquo;s chances of getting a job with
training in that area&rdquo; [<a href="#5.7">5.7</a>], even though I am not convinced that young
scholars always make that assessment or even that they should, given the high
rate of burn-out in professions where the selection of training and research
areas and job attainment are so closely interlocked as to leave little room for
responsible long-range personal choice.</p>
<p>[6.4] Finally, although I should perhaps regret having made that final
statement in my response to Prof. Hisama&rsquo;s paper in which I expressed the hope
that &ldquo;job attainment leading to tenure is not a major motivation for
exploring music outside the canon, taking precedence over the intrinsic interest
of the musical artifact&rdquo; [<a href="#4.5">4.5</a>], I do not. Nor do I withdraw my description
of tenure as &ldquo;that summit of academic achievement&rdquo; [<a href="#4.2">4.2</a>], which, in
making its point, inadvertently exemplified the kind of institutionalized wit to
which I have been exposed for so many years. Thus, although that quip was
intended to be mildly sarcastic, I do believe quite seriously that intellectual
achievement and industry should take precedence over academic security in the
psyche of the burgeoning scholar. At the same time, I certainly value tenure,
for the reason so astutely formulated by Prof. Hisama at the end of her
response, but also for larger reasons having to do with the sanctity of the
academic environment and the need to protect it from anti-intellectual and other
negative forces that may infringe upon the freedom of thought that is so
essential to the development of many, if not all, academic fields, including
ours.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><a href="mto.00.6.3.kaminsky.php" name="Kaminsky">Peter M. Kaminsky, &ldquo;Revenge of the Boomers: Notes on the Analysis of Rock
Music&rdquo;</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[7] Response by Allen Forte</b></p>

<p>[7.1] Before I say a few words about Peter Kaminsky&rsquo;s paper I want to make
clear that my knowledge of rock is quite limited&mdash;some deriving from Mark Spicer
and a couple of other renegade graduate students at Yale, the remainder from
desultory reading and listening. Thus, I approached Prof. Kaminsky&rsquo;s paper with
a clear mind, as it were. If I were running for public office, however, this
would be the moment when I would tearfully reveal my own dalliance with
non-classical or non-concert music, that happy portion of my innocent youth in
which I was involved with the popular music of a different era and a different
repertoire. Thus, although my qualifications for responding to this paper are
meager, my intentions are good.</p>
<p>[7.2] Much of my selective knowledge of rock derives from the anthology
edited by John Covach and Graeme Boone entitled <i>Understanding Rock</i>,<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup>&nbsp;
which contains seven studies, all by academics with substantial music theory
credentials. All the essays involve (forgive me) structural analysis. I should
also point out that my name is inscribed in the Acknowledgments, for reasons
that are not altogether clear to me, except that John Covach is a friend of mine
and I may have uttered words of encouragement in an unguarded moment.</p>
<p>[7.3] When I sat down to make notes on the many highlights of Peter
Kaminsky&rsquo;s paper, the first thing that came to mind was the enthusiasm that
drives it! This is also evident in the analysis, which must have been written
before Part I of the paper; it is so beautifully polished and focused.</p>
<p>[<a name="7.4">7.4</a>] In the non-analytical portion of the paper, I found the discussion of
British authors Philip Tagg and Richard Middleton reasonably fair and broadly
informative, although Prof. Kaminsky stops just short of rejecting Tagg&rsquo;s
intertextuality idea, and comments only briefly on his approach to an <i>Affektenlehre</i>
for popular music&mdash;which seems not such a bad idea, after all. Middleton&rsquo;s
confusion (my interpretation) of analytical approaches and his evident need to
satisfy the pressures of the new musicologists is documented, including yet one
more derogatory reference by Middleton to &ldquo;formalist music theory,&rdquo; a
tiresome, but apparently obligatory gesture.</p>
<p>[7.5] On the other side of the coin, I like Walter Everett&rsquo;s statement and
Peter Kaminsky&rsquo;s elucidation of it, especially the point that the music must
have a certain &ldquo;degree of structural integrity&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.kaminsky.php#9">Kaminsky
9</a>]. This involves the
question of &ldquo;quality,&rdquo; which I feel is so important in the study and
evaluation of non-canonic music.</p>
<p>[7.6] Part II of Professor Kaminsky&rsquo;s paper, his analysis of &ldquo;Lithium
Sunset,&rdquo; is an excellent piece of work. Both the analysis and the tape of
the performance directed my attention to the simple, but very eclectic harmonic
progression. A general study of this aspect of the music, spanning the various
styles that have evolved in the rock genre seems worthwhile, if, indeed, it has
not already been achieved.</p>
<p>[7.7] Since it would be wholly inappropriate to end my laudatory response to
this paper on a positive note, I would like express my opinion that <a href="kaminsky_table_1.html" target="ex_window"> Table 1:
Projects and Publications</a>, seems not altogether useful, since many listings do
not include publication data. Also I am unable to infer anything about
analytical approach. I assume that Prof. Kaminsky knows all of the individuals
involved and has some idea of the quality of their work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[8] Peter Kaminsky replies</b></p>

<p>[8.1] First, my thanks to Professor Forte for his sensitive and thoughtful
response to my contribution for the plenary session. With respect to <a href="kaminsky_table_1.html" target="ex_window"> Table
1</a>,
Forte correctly notes that my omission of publication data (where appropriate)
and the analytical approach taken in these works clearly limits its usefulness
as a bibliographic tool. Given that my original file including such details runs
over twenty pages, I chose to omit this information. My principal motivation in
providing Table 1 was to give a snapshot of the variety and sheer volume of
ongoing, not-yet-published work by theorists and musicologists on rock and
popular music. However, in order to optimize its usefulness, I would be happy to
post for retrieval by interested readers the complete file of survey data from
which Table 1 is drawn.</p>
<p>[8.2] Professor Forte also notes a certain incompleteness in my citation of
Philip Tagg&rsquo;s seminal work, &ldquo;Analyzing Popular Music: Theory, Method and
Practice,&rdquo; from 1982. Tagg&rsquo;s work continues to resonate because of its
central tenets: the study of popular music is of necessity interdisciplinary,
and, therefore, the exclusive use of &ldquo;the traditional tools of musicology
[and by extension music theory]&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., analysis&mdash;is inadequate. I will
first respond with an anecdote. After hearing my run-through for this paper, a
colleague noted, &ldquo;I can understand your use of traditional analysis with
Sting. But take some of the popular music from my formative years, like the
Carpenters for example. Is scholarly study of their music possible?&rdquo; My
response was yes, it is possible. However, here the use of traditional tools of
structural analysis and the central focus on &ldquo;the music itself&rdquo; may
not be very illuminating. Obviously the perspective and choice of methodology
must be appropriate to the music, and should best explain what are perceived as
salient aspects of that music. (I shall leave the proper study of the
Carpenters&rsquo; music as a challenge for some enterprising theorist or
musicologist.)</p>
<p>[<a name="8.3">8.3</a>] There is also the matter of interdisciplinarity itself: one&rsquo;s notion of
what constitutes interdisciplinarity depends in part on how one views the
relation between methodology and the resultant scholarly work. Clearly a number
of scholars view certain analytical tools, especially formal methodologies like
Schenkerian theory, set theory, etc., as constraints and even blinders which,
notwithstanding their explanatory power, also possess the unfortunate side
effect of liquidating any musical elements outside their purview. If, however,
one views an analytical method as enabling rather than enslaving, as filtering
and coloring rather than blinding, then the relation between method and
scholarship changes and becomes symbiotic and catalytic rather than coextensive.
Under this conception, most scholarly work, on popular music as well as other
music theoretical topics, is interdisciplinary to some degree. Hence to debate
what constitutes an appropriate degree of interdisciplinarity is quite a
different matter than merely to question the employment of purely
&ldquo;formalist&rdquo; methods. Moreover, a degree of interdisciplinarity&mdash;or,
closer to home, a rapprochement with musicology (<i>pace</i>  <a href="mto.00.6.3.mccreless.php"> McCreless in his
contribution</a> to this plenary session)&mdash;need not and should not result in a
weakening of theoretical/analytical rigor.</p>
<p>[8.4] In conclusion, I shall turn once more to Tagg, again in response to a
perceptive observation by Professor Forte: &ldquo;Professor Kaminsky stops just
short of rejecting Tagg&rsquo;s intertextuality idea, and comments only briefly on his
approach to an <i>Affektenlehre</i> for popular music&mdash;which seems not such a
bad idea, after all&rdquo; [<a href="#7.4">7.4</a>]. In reconsidering Sting&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lithium
Sunset&rdquo; it is only now apparent to me how relevant Tagg&rsquo;s intertextuality
and his incipient <i>Affektenlehre</i> have been in the formulation of my
analytical approach. Specifically, the markedness (following Robert Hatten in <i>Musical
Meaning in Beethoven</i>) of cross relations carries with it the potential for
expression and representation. This potential is creatively exploited by Sting
against the (ironic) stylistic backdrop of country music, and a listener&rsquo;s
response may be affectively linked to the dual recognition of musical dissonance
and stylistic dissonance. Clearly the genesis of such a network of musical
relations and affects presumes an intertextual framework, which I construe as
one of Tagg&rsquo;s central (and significant) points.</p>
<p>[8.5] In place of a cool and catchy ending appropriate to a popular music
essay, I offer a riddle and a question. Riddle: What is the source of song #2,
&ldquo;Love of My Life&rdquo; (guest artist and co-writer Dave Matthews), on
Santana&rsquo;s recent Grammy-winning album <i>Supernatural</i>? Question: What
difference(s), if any, does this make in a prospective analysis of this song?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[9] Allen Forte responds again</b></p>

<p>[9.1] Peter Kaminsky&rsquo;s informative reaction to my NECMT response does not
elicit very much in the way of a reply, since it essentially enlarges upon
points he made in his original paper&mdash; with the exception, perhaps obviously, of
his brief introduction of &ldquo;interdisciplinarity&rdquo; [<a href="#8.3">8.3</a>] (sesquipedalian
alert!), a topic that underlay some of the papers on that fateful day at
Brandeis, notably Patrick McCreless&rsquo;s, and that was lurking in others, including
my responses. Here is material aplenty for debate, for example, in the reference
to the view that Prof. Kaminsky cites concerning the limiting effects of certain
formalistic analytical methods held by a number of scholars. Clearly, this is a
topic to be set aside for another day, with ample time allowed for sharpening
rhetorical weaponry. Nevertheless, I suspect that a number of scholars would
dispute Prof. Kaminsky&rsquo;s conclusion that <nobr>&ldquo; . . .</nobr> a degree of
interdisciplinarity <nobr>. . .</nobr> need not and should not result in a weakening of
theoretical/analytical rigor&rdquo; [<a href="#8.3">8.3</a>], perhaps rewriting to read, &ldquo;A
degree of theoretical/analytical rigor should not result in a weakening of
interdisciplinarity.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><a href="mto.00.6.3.karpinski.php" name="Karpinski">Gary S. Karpinski, &ldquo;Lessons from the Past: Music Theory Pedagogy and the
Future&rdquo;</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[10] Response by Allen Forte</b></p>

<p>[10.1] I am sure that many of us relate to the issues discussed so cogently
in Prof. Karpinski&rsquo;s fine essay. I know I can, having spent many happy hours
with eager and not so eager undergraduates who are discovering some of the
intricacies of tonal music theory. In my response I will deal with only four of
the six topics covered by Prof. Karpinski, namely, counterpoint, figured bass,
harmony, and curriculum design.</p>
<p>[10.2] Styled or Renaissance counterpoint became widely taught in the U.S.
after the publication of the translation of Knud Jeppesen&rsquo;s <i>The Style of
Palestrina and the Dissonance</i> in 1927,<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>&nbsp;
followed by his 1939 textbook on 16th century counterpoint.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>Many composers teaching theory, which was the norm in those days, adopted this
approach and taught species counterpoint with reference to the vocal repertoire
of the high Renaissance, as formalized in Jeppesen&rsquo;s rules, which corresponded
closely to those of Fux. Counterpoint courses, justified as an essential and
traditional discipline, became standard in many music departments. There was
always the question of student interest, however, inside as well as outside the
academy. George Gershwin became bored with the exercises that Henry Cowell
assigned him, but whether that was Henry&rsquo;s fault or George&rsquo;s remains moot,
although George was known to have a short attention span. Cole Porter, on the
other hand, preserved his extensive French species-like counterpoint exercises,
which are now at Yale.</p>
<p>[10.3] The list of eminent composers who studied species counterpoint is
long. Prof. Karpinski has mentioned Mozart and Beethoven, but there was also
Haydn and Brahms and of course many others. But it was Heinrich Schenker who
understood the basic reason for the importance of counterpoint study: it forges
a link between the fundamental models of musical motion embedded in species
exercises and the often large-scale expansions and elaborations of those models
in free composition. This beautiful idea of course creates a bridge between
high-level music theory and elementary instruction, serving as a model for music
theoretic studies in general.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>
<p>[10.4] Why, then, is counterpoint instruction in decline? I suggest the lack
of qualified teachers as a major reason, teachers who themselves can do
counterpoint and teachers who can make the study interesting and meaningful to
students. Harmony seems so much more accessible, so much easier for the teacher
equipped with the right textbook, that is, the one that tells you what to do
next, and of course students who do not expect too much from theory are unaware
of what they are missing.</p>
<p>[10.5] When it comes to figured bass, I am very old fashioned. As everyone
here knows, this notational system was intended originally for performers, but
gradually became a standard way of introducing students to music as nascent
composers. It is a wonderful way of obtaining immediate and tactile access to
counterpoint, construed as tonal voice-leading, and to harmony, construed as
constellations of intervals arranged vertically.</p>
<p>[10.6] As in the case of counterpoint, why is figured bass not taught as a
standard course? Once again, there is the matter of teacher competence. How many
teachers can actually play from figured bass, let alone improvise over a given
bass? Also, mass instruction in figured bass is out of the question. In my
experience, individual lessons are the best way of experiencing this basic
discipline, unless, of course, one of Gary Karpinski&rsquo;s machines, schooled in
Artificial Intelligence, comes along to solve that problem!</p>
<p>[10.7] Since my own harmony textbook has been out of print for some time, my
remarks in this area may be somewhat out of control. I will say, however, that
most harmony books are deplorable, beginning with the absence of any stated
purpose for publication of the book in the first place. With Prof. Karpinski, I
would also emphasize that in many textbooks, excluding of course Aldwell &amp;
Schachter, there is a failure to distinguish between harmony and voice leading,
a failure that in the worst case leads to the dismal preparation for advanced
analysis that those of us teaching graduate students routinely experience. As
Prof. Karpinski points out, this is not a new problem. And in this connection I
might cite Brahms&rsquo;s statement in a letter to Hugo Riemann: &ldquo;You would not
believe what I had to put up with from incompetent textbooks and how I had to
unlearn everything.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
<p>[10.8] Prof. Karpinski correctly identifies the movement of largest scale
concerned with curriculum design in this country: the Comprehensive Musicianship
Program of the 1960s, funded by the Ford Foundation. In its defense I should say
that many dedicated and idealistic musicians were deeply involved in the
program, which, thanks to Ford money, was able to sponsor workshops that
disseminated CMP philosophy across the country. However, the problems Prof.
Karpinski outlines were and are real. His integrated curriculum sounds
wonderful, although I am concerned about its practicality, simply in terms of
available faculty in a small music department such as we have at Yale.</p>
<p>[10.9] As my final word on this topic, I would recall Prof. Karpinski&rsquo;s
rueful close: <nobr>&ldquo;. . .</nobr> but none of this [referring to the adoption of new
methods, new technologies, etc.] will matter very much at all if we have nothing
of real value to impart&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.karpinski.php#8.1">Karpinski
8.1</a>]. In reflecting upon this
statement, it occurred to me that perhaps the best way of measuring the real
value of our teaching is to try to imagine the degree to which it will have a
positive effect upon the musical activities of our students in the future, which
is after all not such a vague undertaking, because it is supported by our own
experience as students and, increasingly over time, by our experience as
teachers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b><a href="mto.00.6.3.mccreless.php" name="McCreless">Patrick P. McCreless, &ldquo;Music Theory and Historical
Awareness&rdquo;</a></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[11] Response by Allen Forte</b></p>

<p>[11.1] Before I say a few words inspired by Patrick McCreless&rsquo;s paper, I
would like to introduce an excerpt from a relevant article published in the
recent past. The topic of the article is high-level, academic music criticism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Criticism does not exist yet on the American music-academic scene, but
something does exist which may feel rather like it: theory and analysis. The
shadowy, fluid state of the field; its problematic relation to analysis; the
sporadic nature of the published material; the small number of
practitioners&mdash;these features certainly make it hard to get hold of and discuss
with confidence. However, I think we realize that those practitioners, if they
ever paid the least attention to traditional musicology, might fairly claim
achievements ranking in rigor and importance with those of the historians.
Theory and analysis are not equivalent to criticism, then, but they are pursuing
techniques of vital importance to criticism. They represent a force and a
positive one in the academic climate of music, and tactful efforts should be
made (on both sides, let us sincerely hope) to arrange a rapprochement with
musicology.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[11.2] This remarkable view of the field of American music theory as it was
then emerging has of course changed quite radically, and one wonders exactly
what the author read in those early signs of vitality, which had not yet peaked
on that glorious fall day in 1977 at Northwestern University, when a few of us
proclaimed our independence from Musicology and led the way to the founding of
the Society for Music Theory. At any event, according to Prof. McCreless, we
ought to pursue the rapprochement so strongly advocated by the author of my
quotation, and, in certain respects, I must agree with him.</p>
<p>[11.3] A major question concerning the pursuit of a
&ldquo;rapprochement,&rdquo; however, is the extent to which we then weaken one of
the major characteristics of American music theory that has drawn international
attention. I refer to the rigor, precision, and logic of the more abstract
studies in the field, many of which have been published in <i>Journal of Music
Theory</i> since its inception in 1957 and, later, in the society&rsquo;s journal, <i>Music
Theory Spectrum</i>. I am especially concerned here with the nature of the field as
it will be determined by present-day graduate students in future years, with the
perception of music theory as the handmaiden of musicology (its role in European
musicology), especially if it is radically reshaped by the new musicologists. I
know that this is a dangerously exaggerated statement of course, and I only make
it to reinforce my point, which is that music theory needs to preserve its
essential independence, no matter what Leo Treitler, Lawrence Kramer, or other
eminent scholarly figures say!</p>
<p>[11.4] Except for omitting this important feature of American music theory,
Prof. McCreless&rsquo;s description of the distinction between the interests of the
musicologists and those of the theorists around, say, 1960, is apt and concise.
In particular, the question of repertoire, which he raises, is an important one.
Upon reflection it occurred to me that many of the individuals interested in
music theory in its formative days had a background in musical composition,
hence were involved in the problems of 20th-century music and its structural
immediacies. It is also true that the horizons of music theorists have been
considerably uplifted, both with respect to target repertoires for music
theoretical and analytical applications as well as in relation to
music-historical events that pertain to music theory. The recent movement called
Neo-Riemannian is a case in point, and the exegesis and reinterpretation of
Rameauian thought is another.</p>
<p>[11.5] The crux of Prof. McCreless&rsquo;s paper, concerns the point at which
musicology and music theory most profitably meet. I quote his eloquent
description of that confluence: <nobr>&ldquo;. . .</nobr> at the joint where analysis shades
into interpretation, where structure shades into hermeneutics&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.mccreless.php#5">McCreless
5</a>]. A little further on he writes: &ldquo;It is <nobr>. . .</nobr> at this juncture of
analysis and interpretation that historical awareness can best deepen and enrich
the analyses that we do as theorists, and that analysis can best deepen and
enrich the critical interpretations that we do as historians&rdquo; [<a href="mto.00.6.3.mccreless.php#5">McCreless
5</a>].</p>
<p>[11.6] As an instance of historical awareness, we have heard Prof.
McCreless&rsquo;s sensitive and perceptive reading of the opening portion of
Shostakovich&rsquo;s <i>First Quartet</i>, and I need not comment upon it, except to
suggest that it may not be what the new musicologists would have in mind as a
contribution to a rapprochement. There is no literary criticism, no narrativity,
no deep hermeneutics, and no sex.</p>
<p>[11.7] Finally, it seems to me that when we consider the juncture of analysis
and interpretation or structure and hermeneutics the elemental question remains:
how much does each contribute toward illumination of music? The answer to this
question should perhaps be left open until the rapprochement is achieved. But
because the new musicologists have left no doubt about their scorn for
formalized music theory and structural analysis, they have created a substantial
crevasse that would have to be traversed as part of any serious effort toward
rapprochement, unless of course music theorists simply jump without looking.</p>
