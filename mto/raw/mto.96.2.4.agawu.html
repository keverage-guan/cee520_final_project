<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] <a NAME="FN1REF"></a> Analysis has always played a role in 
musicology.  &ldquo;The analytical
process,&rdquo; writes Arnold Whittall, and echoing a generation of
structuralists, &ldquo;is two-fold: to identify the various materials of a
composition, and to define the ways in which they function.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Thus
defined, analysis is indispensable to a discipline that takes the
musical object as its point of departure.  Not all branches of
musicology demand a vigorous deployment of analytical techniques.  And
this is in part because not all branches of musicology are directly
concerned with the experience of music.  Attending to the archive (not
canon) of musical works is, however, impossible without analytical
mediation, itself propped up by an explicit or&mdash;more likely&mdash;implicit
theory.<p>


[2] Analysis plays an even more central role in the discipline of
Music Theory.  Traditionally defined, theory undertakes to codify &ldquo;the
various materials of a composition&rdquo; and to exemplify their functioning
in a range of works; it insists that its methods meet explicitly
stated criteria of coherence; and it often proclaims aesthetic
preferences, though not always directly. In a little-known essay
published posthumously, Adorno reflects upon the potential of music
analysis.  Reading notation, for example, requires &ldquo;an analytical
act&rdquo;; analysis is &ldquo;the prerequisite for an adequate performance&rdquo;, and
aesthetic theories on music are &ldquo;inconceivable without analysis.&rdquo;
Perhaps most important of all, analysis &ldquo;has to do with the 
<i>surplus</i>
[das Mehr] in art,&rdquo; this surplus being the &ldquo;truth content&rdquo; of a work
in so far as it goes beyond the mere facts.  <a NAME="FN2REF"></a>&ldquo;No 
analysis,&rdquo; Adorno
writes, &ldquo;is of any value if it does not terminate in the truth content
of the work, and this, for its part, is mediated through the work&rsquo;s
<i>technical structure</i>&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[3] <a NAME="FN3REF"></a> Not all areas of theory need analysis, but by 
and large the
majority of scholars who regard themselves as &lsquo;theorists&rsquo; or
&lsquo;analysts&rsquo; or &lsquo;practicing analysts&rsquo; are often engaged in a more or
less systematic inquiry into the structure of &lsquo;the music itself.&rsquo;
Analysis allows practitioners to come to grips with &ldquo;the detail of a
musical whole.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Its rewards, like 
those of musical performance,
stem from a hands-on experience.  Although it makes claims about
knowledge (here the differences between analysis and theory are
noteworthy), an analysis does not merely produce a detached set of
results available in verbal form.  This is neither to mystify the
analytical process nor to claim for it transcendent status; it is
rather to remind us of the easily forgotten fact that there are
different kinds of musical knowledge, and that these are constituted
in a complex variety of ways.<p>

[4]<a NAME="FN4REF"></a> Analysis, finally, is a relatively young 
discipline.  According to
Ian Bent, analysis &ldquo;as a pursuit in its own right, came to be
established only in the late 19th century.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Although codified
analytical methods date back at least to the eighteenth century, and
although the refinement and formalization of techniques in our own
century have depended directly on those earlier developments, it is
perhaps more than merely coincidental that not until the 1980s did the
first comprehensive guides to analytical techniques in English appear:
Ian Bent&rsquo;s Grove spin off, <i>Analysis</i> (1980/1987); Nicholas Cook&rsquo;s 
<i>A
Guide to Musical Analysis</i> (1987); and Jonathan Dunsby and Arnold
Whittall&rsquo;s <i>Music Analysis in Theory and Practice </i>(1988).  
Intended
in part to meet a pedagogical need, these books take full advantage of
the specialized studies of previous decades in order to consolidate
analytical knowledge.  The stage was now set, it seemed, for exploring
the range of applicability of various techniques, for interrogating
their foundations, and for assessing their limitations.<p>

[5] <a NAME="FN5REF"></a> Before this intra-disciplinary 
self-examination could play itself
out, however, the young discipline of analysis came under attack.  In
&ldquo;How We Got Into Analysis and How to Get Out&rdquo; published in 1980,
Joseph Kerman asked theorists some tough questions, and then proceeded
to elevate his own brand of criticism to a position of privilege among
the competing discourses about music.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Although he recognized
criticism&rsquo;s debt to analysis, Kerman nevertheless placed a higher
premium on a research enterprise that did not terminate either in the
gathering of facts or in the establishment of a work&rsquo;s internal
relationships.  <a NAME="FN6REF"></a> His book of five years 
later, <i>Contemplating Music</i>,
enabled a crystallization of the offending categories as &lsquo;positivism&rsquo;
and &lsquo;formalism&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Although these 
terms carry considerable semantic
and ideological baggage, their complex histories were subsequently
suppressed in the drive to inform about the limitations of
theory-based analysis.  The charge of formalism was made because
analysts inquired only into the connections between patterns within a
piece; they did not deal with matters of affect and expression, with
the &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of music, with its cultural context.  This unfortunate
misrepresentation of a hitherto complex theoretical enterprise made
possible the prescription of an instant cure. To escape the dilemmas
of formalism, you must attach the patterns you have observed to
something else: a plot, a program, an emotional scenario, a context,
an agenda, a fantasy, or a narrative.  You must, in other words,
problematize the gap between the musical and the extra-musical.  <a NAME="FN7REF"></a> The
findings of formalist analysis are like a severed phallus; ideally,
they should be re-attached.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><p>

[6] It was in this anti-formalist climate that the so-called &lsquo;new
musicology&rsquo; emerged.  To say that they are united in their
anti-formalist stance may not please the new musicologists, for an
essential part of their strategy is to deny any stable, collective
identity, to insist on the impossibility of anchoring the first
signifying relationship.  Such denial is understandable in light of
the different initiatives that are gradually coalescing into a &lsquo;new
musicology.&rsquo;  But could such denial also be a trick aimed at ensuring
that new musicologists are always able to shift their identities in
order to, as it were, remain on top?<p>

[7] What, then, is the new musicology?  In her 1994 presidential
address to the American Musicological Society, Ellen Rosand took note
of &ldquo;new approaches to music, most of them developed in other fields.&rdquo;
<a NAME="FN8REF"></a> She writes, &ldquo;Semiotics, response and reception 
theory, narratology,
gender theory, cultural criticism&mdash;these are just some of the
analytical approaches that have been newly brought to bear on the
study of music.  And the result is a conglomeration of critical
activities commonly called the &lsquo;new musicology.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> <a NAME="FN9REF"></a> The new 
musicology
is, in short, eclectic and selectively pluralistic.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup><p>

[8] <a NAME="FN10REF"></a> Rosand&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Musicology of the Present,&rdquo; 
with its subtle
suppression of any prophetic claims, and its even-handed review of
current musicological activity, challenges but also reinforces the
substance of an article published two years earlier under the
unabashed title, &ldquo;The Musicology of the Future.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Lawrence Kramer
admits that &ldquo;the new conceptual modes are too motley a grouping to
form a school, and too critical of grand syntheses to admit of one.&rdquo;
He nevertheless offers the single most forthright statement about the
new musicology that I have come across.  Kramer&rsquo;s is not a casual
invitation to interested music scholars to sample some new products.
On the contrary, it is nothing less than a prophecy about the death of
musicology.  In order to survive, musicology must embrace a network of
&ldquo;postmodernist strategies of understanding&rdquo;.  And despite his words to
the contrary, Kramer&rsquo;s enumeration reads like a manifesto: &ldquo;The
theories that ground [postmodernist] strategies are radically
anti-foundationalist, anti-essentialist, and anti-totalizing.  They
emphasize the constructedness, both linguistic and ideological, of all
human identities and institutions.  They insist on the relativity of
all knowledge to the disciplines&mdash;not just the conceptual
presuppositions but the material, discursive, and social
practices&mdash;that produce and circulate knowledge.  <a NAME="FN11REF"></a> While often
disagreeing with each other, poststructuralists, neopragmatists,
feminists, psychoanalytic theorists, critical social theorists,
multiculturalists and others have been changing the very framework
within which disagreement can meaningfully occur.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> To give up
essentialist, foundationalist and totalizing discourses is to
radically rethink the basic task of representation.  A simple&mdash;though
I hope not simplistic&mdash;account of Kramer&rsquo;s statement may be given as
follows.  We should now accept that there are no nuggets of identity,
no positivisms, no irreducible essences.  There are no invariant first
principles, no God or universal reason, no single grand narratives by
which human history can be conceptualized.  Our epistemologies are
constructed and situated.  Everything is fragmented and discontinuous;
all truths are partial and provisional.  Nothing is ever objective,
nothing is ever &lsquo;new,&rsquo; and nothing can be taken for granted.  This
bold attempt to wipe the slate clean is, of course, salutary, a long
overdue and a much-needed initiative to liberate musicology (and music
theory) from their ostensible conservatism and complacency.  If we
read Kramer&rsquo;s statement as a call to action rather than as a summary
of existing scholarship, if in other words we detach its political
motivation from the cogency of its epistemology, then it is hard to
imagine any worthwhile opposition to his vision of a new musicology.
<p>

[9] To the question, What has the new musicology achieved so far?, one
answer may be that it has fostered what is often presented as a new
way of construing cultural objects.  Politically-motivated criticism
is in; issues of race, gender construction and sexuality that impinge
on the consumption of music are very much in.  Non-canonical
repertoires, especially of the popular variety, are in.  The reception
of music, understood not necessarily as an account of other listening
subjects (with specific histories and geographies), but as an account
developed around the individual subject, is in in a big way.  One&rsquo;s
insights need not meet the test of intersubjective corroboration; nor
do they need to be propped up by what is often presented as an
over-determined theory-based analysis.  The fantasies set in motion by
biography, be it that of composer, performer, or listening subject,
need no longer be suppressed or even understated.  And the language in
which all of this is mediated is best if it highlights the
performative element in writing&mdash;charged, colorful, sometimes obscure
sometimes playful, but never clinical or &lsquo;scientific.&rsquo;<p>

[10] Which brings us to the question of analysis. Since analysis is
associated with formalism, and since the new musicology is, among
other things, an anti-formalist movement, and since the discipline of
theory is constituted in large measure by practicing analysts, it
would seem that the aims of theory and the new musicology are
fundamentally incompatible. Is there any way in which music theory can
embrace the positive tenets of the new musicology and still give due
attention to what Adorno called the &lsquo;technical structure&rsquo; of musical
works, not as an end but as a means to an end?<p>




[11] It is not possible to answer this question within the scope of a
brief essay, for there is such a wide variety of new musicological
offerings that any attempt to establish its analytical program as a
unified and coherent project is bound to be defeated even before it
has begun.  Nevertheless, it is worth noting that note-by-note
analysis has so far not played a central role in the new musicology.
To avoid analysis or close reading of scores altogether may be one way
of escaping the dilemmas associated with analysis as a modernist
pursuit.  But my interest here is not in those publications that
deliberately avoid analysis but in those that use analysis, however
tangentially, to buttress their claims.  Here, a curious picture
emerges.  Rather than develop new methods for analysis, methods that
are free of conventional biases, new musicologists often fall back on
conventional methods.  The props of insight-formation are considered
self-evident.  Rarely are the perceptual and conceptual foundations of
musical analysis openly confronted.  <a NAME="FN12REF"></a> It is hard 
to square this
particular manifestation of reticence among some new musicologists
with the searching, no-nonsense spirit of post-modern inquiry.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> <p>

[12] <a NAME="FN13REF"></a> One brief example may help to focus the 
issues.  Susan McClary
attempts to tease out &ldquo;narrative agendas&rdquo; in the first movement of
Brahms&rsquo;s Third Symphony.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> Her aim 
is not to provide a detailed
analysis in the manner of an &ldquo;austere&rdquo; formalist (like Carl Dahlhaus)
but to remind us that the conventions upon which Brahms depended were
not free of social meaning.  Tonality, for example, involves the
chanelling of desire, while sonata form is gendered in its thematic
process.  How are these (historically and socio-culturally) prior
characterizations domesticated in the Brahms&rsquo;s movement?  McClary
offers not one but several competing narratives, narratives that do
not invest heavily in the &lsquo;technical structure&rsquo; (in Adorno&rsquo;s sense) of
the movement.  The first and most obvious is a gendered discourse: a
heroic and obviously masculine first theme in the tonic, F major, is
followed by a seductive and feminine second theme in the
(unconventional) key of A major.  In the development section, the
second theme precedes the first, its character now changed from
feminine to masculine; the first theme, which appears towards the
close of the development, is now feminized.  The recapitulation &ldquo;goes
through the paces of the exposition once again.&rdquo; In this first
narrative, then, McClary is interested in the character of themes,
privileging overarching characterizations over inherent contradictions
among the constituent dimensional processes.
<p>

[13] The second narrative is oedipal.  The relationship of alterity
between first and second themes is now reread as &ldquo;the archetypal
struggle of the rebellious son against the conventional Law of the
Father.&rdquo; A third narrative is a racial discourse arising from the
seductive second theme, described by Hermann Kretzschmar as &ldquo;Delilah.&rdquo;
McClary takes this to be a sign of &ldquo;Oriental exoticism,&rdquo; chides the
doubting modern listener for forgetting that the theme &ldquo;would have
been conceived and perceived as &lsquo;Oriental&rsquo; within the codes of that
time,&rdquo; and implies that Brahms, like the hundreds of culprits
assembled in Edward Said&rsquo;s book <i>Orientalism</i>, was an orientalist.
<a NAME="FN14REF"></a>(He was not the only one, of course; orientalism 
forms a kind of
epistemological constant, perhaps even a cognitive constant in
European constructions of subjectivity).<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The fourth narrative
concerns the interplay between a generalized set of norms and Brahms&rsquo;s
specific practice.  It turns out that the heroic first theme,
alternatively described as masculine and as embodying the oedipal
Father, is in fact &ldquo;dissonant with respect to the conventions that
sustain [the movement&rsquo;s] narrative procedures.&rdquo; In other words the
masculine Father is atypical, an aberration.  From this follows a
fifth claim, namely that the &ldquo;real dilemma&rdquo; of the movement is &ldquo;how to
define closure in a piece in F major that insists on maintaining a
defiant <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> for purposes of identity.&rdquo;<p>

[14] This last claim may come as a surprise to some readers, for it
opens up a line of inquiry that might have formed not the end but the
beginning of a &lsquo;formalist&rsquo; analysis. And it is here that the theorist
may wonder whether it is possible to press the earlier narratives into
the detail of the music?  Can an analysis that is concerned not only
with the A&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> issue (which McClary says is the &ldquo;real dilemma&rdquo; of the
movement) but with other semitonal relations, with third-related keys,
with motivic expansion and contraction, and with the (sometimes
enormous) trajectories built by Brahms&rsquo;s periodicity: can such an
analysis provide the conditions of possibility for McClary&rsquo;s
overarching characterizations?  A theorist who argues that McClary&rsquo;s
analysis lacks detail may well be making an irrelevant point.  There
is enough detail to support the specific characterizations that she
wishes to make.
<p>

 [15] And so we reach an impasse: theory-based analysis, which prides
itself on leading the analyst to the &lsquo;truth content&rsquo; of a work as
mediated by its &lsquo;technical structure&rsquo; (Adorno), which allows the
musical mind to engage directly with the compositional elements
themselves&mdash;such analysis seems to be of limited utility in a project
that interprets music as social discourse.  The truth seems to be that
new musicologists have so far not found a use for the <i>surplus of
detail</i> that theory-based analysis produces.  It would be helpful if
this surplus was acknowledged either as a presence or as a problem.
To object that theory-based analysis is a self-fulfilling and
self-referential exercise is to pretend that tautology and circularity
are ever avoidable in the criticism of art&mdash;they are not.  And the
analyst&rsquo;s failure to reach for an extramusical label, her failure to
provide a &lsquo;translation&rsquo; of the analysis, as if that which goes
unlabelled or untranslated necessarily lies outside the bounds of
&lsquo;social discourse&rsquo;: these (and other) issues need to be aired.<p>


[16] Referring generally to &lsquo;new musicologists&rsquo;&mdash;as I have done in the
foregoing paragraphs&mdash;and drawing conclusions about their approach to
analysis produces a limited and perhaps ambiguous set of results.  By
the same token, however, the habit of some new musicologists of
ritually denouncing &lsquo;formalist&rsquo; analysis would gain greater
credibility if the group of theorists, too, was understood not as a
monolithic group espousing a single doctrine but as a highly diverse
group motivated by a few shared concerns.  We could go further.
Within the discipline of theory, there exists a vast range of
innovative inquiries that have been overlooked by new musicologists.
Were it not for theorists&rsquo; reticence about adopting new slogans, these
initiatives would easily converge into a &ldquo;New Theory.&rdquo; New
musicologists&rsquo; failure to acknowledge this work does not, of course,
deny it a place in the discourses of the musical sciences.  <a NAME="FN15REF"></a> It only
testifies to a willed amnesia on their part, a necessary strategy,
perhaps, for redrawing the boundaries of the musical disciplines.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> <p>

[17] Allow me to mention, by way of conclusion, a few contributions
that touch upon aspects of the new musicological agenda.  In doing so,
I am conscious of the scores of studies that will necessarily go
unmentioned.  (An attempt to include European precedents for these
[mostly American] discourses alone would fill an entire paper).  I am
also conscious of the fact that some of my authors have moved on from
the intellectual positions espoused in these papers.  Nor do I mean to
hold these up necessarily as the best or most influential or most
representative work produced by music theorists recently.  I mean
simply to note their existence.  <a NAME="FN16REF"></a> Such an 
exercise will have achieved
its aim if it encourages new musicologists to temper their
proclamation of the novelty of their efforts with some acknowledgment
of the traces that exist in some corners of American music theory.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> <p>



[18] <a NAME="FN17REF"></a> Back in the 1970s, Thomas Clifton was busy 
developing ideas about
the phenomenology of music, elaborating notions of play, and composing
a poetics of musical silence.  I haven&rsquo;t seen Clifton&rsquo;s name (or, for
that matter, those of latter-day phenomenologists) in the new
musicology&rsquo;s footnotes.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> David 
Lewin, in his relentless and
disciplined pursuit of the &lsquo;truth content&rsquo; of musical works, has
frequently developed hermeneutic readings from paths as diverse as
those of a layered metrical and hyper-metrical coherence, or the paths
of voices in adjacent chromatic collections. <a NAME="FN18REF"></a> The 
resulting analyses,
valued for their technical demonstration as well as for their
aesthetic implications, can hardly be consigned to a class of
formalist analyses.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> <p>

[19] Charles J. Smith, writing about harmony, probably the least
translatable of musical dimensions, and one that has (therefore) not
featured prominently in recent readings of music as social text,
encourages us to multiply our descriptions of chordal affiliation in
order to embrace the challenge of multiple meaning without at the same
time stooping to an all-pervasive relativism.  <a NAME="FN19REF"></a> 
Smith&rsquo;s is not merely a
call; it includes a concrete demonstration, an exploration of limits,
allowing the reader to assess the limitations of his claims.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> <a NAME="FN20REF"></a> Alan
Street has continued to remind us of the foundational instability of
our terms, the contingency of our analyses, and the fragility of our
conceptual constructs.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> In 1987 
Robert Snarrenberg experimented
with the Derridean notion of <i>differance</i> in an analysis of
Brahms&rsquo;s Intermezzo, Op. 118 No. 2.  <a NAME="FN21REF"></a> Explicating 
notions of difference
and deferring, Snarrenberg sought to mediate between a &lsquo;strong
reading&rsquo; of the Intermezzo following the methods of Lerdahl and
Jackendoff and Brahms&rsquo;s sly cadential practice.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> <a NAME="FN22REF"></a> Later in 
the same
journal, Patrick McCreless gave serious attention to three of the five
codes assembled by Roland Barthes&rsquo;s in <i>S/Z</i>, testing their musical
applicability on the tonal grounds of the first movement of
Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ghost Trio.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
Readings like Snarrenberg&rsquo;s and
McCreless&rsquo; allow a more effective assessment of the usefulness of
transferring literary-critical terms into music analysis.
<p>

[20] Even the so-called obsession with unity has been rethought in
productive ways.  Rick Cohn and Doug Dempster have explored the
possibility of plural unities, a concept that may at first sight
appear anathema to card-carrying theorists, who have often depended on
an undivided first principle.  In pursuing the possible &lsquo;divisions&rsquo; of
that first principle, Cohn and Dempster are responding to a quite
specific challenge, and doing so constructively and from within the
discipline.  <a NAME="FN23REF"></a> It is hard to finish their article 
and still maintain
that theory is somehow laboring under the yoke of uninterrogated
foundationalist premises.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> <p>

[21] <a NAME="FN24REF"></a> In a challenging and controversial article, 
Richard Littlefield
and David Neumeyer laid bare an aspect of Schenkerian ideology,
arguing that mastery of narrative tropes by the analyst is what allows
the analyzed work to be configured as an aesthetic object of high or
low standing, and not necessarily anything inherent in the work
itself.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> In different but 
complementary ways, Kevin Korsyn and
<a NAME="FN25REF"></a> Joseph Straus have appropriated Bloomian notions 
of anxiety of
influence to explain striking recompositional points of contact
between Brahms and Chopin (and Reger) and between the canonical
early-twentieth century masters and their forbears.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> In the area of
musical semiotics, David Lidov, in a series of writings that deserves
to be better known, has exemplified processes of meaning formation
stemming from repetition, including the place of the body in the play
of music&rsquo;s signifiers.  <a NAME="FN26REF"></a> Again, I am yet to see a 
reference to Lidov&rsquo;s
provocative work in any of the new musicological writing.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> <a NAME="FN27REF"></a> Ongoing
work on metaphor and on the discourses of music theory and analysis
by, among others, Marion Guck and Fred Maus, continues to remind us of
the constructedness of our pedagogical schemes, their situatedness,
their gendered biases, and hence their limitations.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> <a NAME="FN28REF"></a> And Carl
Schachter concluded a recent study of harmony and voice-leading in a
Bach Prelude by attaching ideas of structure to ideas of theological
symbolism.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup><p>

[22] This list could be greatly extended, of course, but not here.  The
evidence of these and numerous other studies ought to do three things:
first, to remind us that some of the challenges posed by new
musicologists have not gone unobserved in the theoretical literature;
second, to help counter the gross and surprisingly popular criticism
of music theory as a merely formalist enterprise and to enjoin new
musicologists to approach the intellectual capital of music theory
with a bit more discrimination; third, to demand of new musicologists
a new and improved approach to analysis, one that escapes the dangers
of present practices that they have identified. Theorists&rsquo; commitment
to analytical demonstration is sometimes facilely dismissed as an
outgrowth of a modernist impulse.  And their acceptance of a burden of
proof would seem to slow them down, throwing a &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; veil
over their activities.  Why this should be a cause for concern is not
clear.  Academic discourse is surely not racing towards a single
finishing line.</p>

Macmillan, 1980], vol. 1, pages 340&ndash;88).  This procedure of first
determining the &lsquo;units&rsquo; of a given structure and second establishing
their rules of combination is associated with musical semiology in its
earliest phases, that is, in the writings of Nicolas Ruwet and
Jean-Jacques Nattiez.  See Ruwet, &ldquo;Methods of Analysis in Musicology,&rdquo;
<i>Music Analysis</i> 6 (1987), pages 11&ndash;36 and Nattiez, &ldquo;Varese&rsquo;s

his most recent
book,<i>Classical Music and Postmodern knowledge</i> (Berkeley: 
University
of California Press, 1995), Kramer develops this vision further,
stressing the need to reinject a human interest into music criticism
and to recover a (lost) public discourse about music.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">It has always seemed odd to me that the on-going 
debates within
theory and analysis, which in many ways capture the spirit of
post-modern inquiry, have been marginalized in the characterization of
theorists as &lsquo;formalists.&rsquo;  For one among many examples of theory&rsquo;s
self-reflexivity, see the first section, &ldquo;Metatheory and Methodology,&rdquo;
in <i> Perspectives on Contemporary Music Theory</i>, ed. Benjamin 
Boretz
and Edward T. Cone (New York: Norton, 1972).  For an insightful and
cogent account of the historical development of music theory in the
United States, see Patrick McCreless, &ldquo;Rethinking Contemporary Music
Theory.&rdquo; In  <i>State of the Art: Refiguring Music Studies in the 
1980s</i>,

orientalism in music, see Ralph P. Locke, &ldquo;Reflections on Orientalism

pages 49&ndash;64. and &ldquo;Constructing the Oriental &lsquo;Other,&rsquo;: Saint Saens&rsquo;s
Samson et Dalila,&rdquo; <i>Cambridge Opera Journal</i> 3 (1991), pages 261&ndash;302.
The argument is, of course, easier to make with regard to opera than
it is to instrumental music, McClary&rsquo;s subject.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">A startling omission from the new musicology&rsquo;s 
discursive
practices is any sustained engagement with the intellectual heritage
of the discipline of ethnomusicology.  Practically all of the new
musicology&rsquo;s favorite subjects&mdash;concerns with race, gender, sexuality,
non-canonical repertoires, the nature of representation, etc&mdash;have not
only been touched upon but in some cases theorized explicitly by
ethnomusicologists.  Surely this engagement is long overdue.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">I do not include here pockets of &lsquo;old&rsquo; 
musicological research that
deal directly or indirectly with the new musicology&rsquo;s concerns, but
that, too, have been relegated to the margins.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Thomas Clifton&rsquo;s major work <i>Music as Heard: A 
Study in Applied Phenomenology</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press,

ground music theory in experience and to define and exemplify music
analysis dynamically in terms of acts and actions rather than static
