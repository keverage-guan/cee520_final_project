<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Sometime around the middle of the ninth century, perhaps in the
northern reaches of Lothringia, some singing teachers whose identities
remain anonymous organized two basic handbooks to guide instruction in
music. These handbooks have been handed down to posterity as the
<i>Musica Enchiriadis</i> and the <i>Scolica Enchiriadis</i>. 
Marginalized with
the success of early eleventh-century north Italian theory (Guido of
Arezzo its standard bearer), the <i>Musica</i> and <i>Scolica 
Enchiriadis</i>
(henceforth ME and SE respectively) were accorded a place in the canon
of European music theoretical texts with their publication in volume
one of Martin Gerbert&rsquo;s <i>Scriptores Ecclesiastici de Musica Sacra
Potissimum</i> (1784). (That Gerbert misattributed them to Hucbald need
not concern us here.)<p>

[2]  The appearance in 1981 of a critical edition 
edited by Hans Schmid
paved the way for detailed scrutiny of these and related writings and
set the conditions for a responsible English rendition.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> With the
present publication of Raymond Erickson&rsquo;s fluent translation, the ME
and SE have become readily accessible to anglophone readers, and their
significance for the early stages of Western European music theory can
be more widely appreciated.
<p>



[3] As Erickson points out in his comprehensive introduction, major
eleventh-century theorists&mdash;Guido of Arezzo, Berno and Hermann of
Reichenau, the anonymous author of the <i>Quaestiones in 
musica</i>&mdash;were
familiar with the ME/SE. Although they reject the daseian tetrachords
and notation that are the hallmarks of the Enchiriadis group, many of
the concepts they employ and issues they address arise directly from
those treatises. The Enchiriadis theorists insist on the modal
functionality of individual pitches and refer fundamental theoretical
claims to empirical judgment: &ldquo;when you sing this <nobr>. . .</nobr> you will
perceive that <nobr>. . .</nobr> &rdquo; (page 9).  They delve into 
reasons for basic
musical phenomena, selectively appropriating from Boethius principles
that have explanatory value and relate directly to ninth-century
practices. They are serious in trying to discover and explain the deep
reasons behind well-formed melody and agreeable sounds (<i>armonia</i>),
the <i>Scolica</i>, with Boethius as guide, pursuing this far into the
numerical realm, the <i>Musica</i> (chapter 19) concluding that the real
profundity of music, its impact upon the soul (<i>anima</i>), can 
scarcely
be expressed in words.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Among 
remarkable innovative elements in
these two treatises, Erickson enumerates &ldquo;the first fixed-pitch
notation, the earliest (and sometimes only) notated versions of the
chants cited, the earliest description of polyphonic singing, and the
first technical discussion of modal theory based on final and ambitus&rdquo;
(page xxi).<p>

[4] The Enchiriadis theorists lived in an environment where liturgical
chant of the Christian Church (that dialect we call Gregorian) was the
prime significant manifestation of sounding music. In trying to
understand their realm of musical experience in a rational way, they
came to recognize two fundamental realities. One was the four basic
pitches or functions that accounted for the four distinct modal
qualities familiar to them. Each pitch type was assigned a fixed place
in a model tetrachord and received its own distinctive daseian sign.
Replication of the daseian tetrachord through various registers
generated a scale (two octaves and a tritone) adequate to compass the
adult male voice range. (The ME puts it that the pitches may be
extended up or down &ldquo;until the voice gives out&rdquo; [page 3].) The other
fundamental reality was the agreeable sound of the <i>ymphoniae</i>. 
These
select intervals&mdash;fourth, fifth, and octave&mdash;accounted for aurally
salient associative relations among pitches and were employed with
suave effect in organal singing of chant. The diapason was
particularly agreeable, since its two constituent pitches were &ldquo;not so
much consonant as equal-sounding&rdquo; (page 53).
<p>

[5] These two realities are not entirely congruent, for the daseian
scale and notational system are periodic at the fifth, ninth, and
thirteenth, while octave equivalence is periodic at the eighth and
fifteenth. In an aural/oral situation, the necessary adjustments can
be slipped in as a simple matter of &ldquo;sighting,&rdquo; but in a written,
theoretical context, conflict between the two is inescapable. This
incongruence was recognized by the Enchiriadis theorists, and gives
rise to probing questions and expansive answers in the SE (e.g. pages 89&ndash;93). The ME theorist invokes a &ldquo;wondrous change&rdquo; through which
octaves are made equivalent even though tones a ninth apart are &ldquo;found
to be the same [daseian symbol and function]&rdquo; (pages 18&ndash;19).  The
discrepancy forces the theorists and the scribes who transmitted their
writings to devise special notational strategies for the examples of
organum involving octave doubling. Although the translation prints
some figures as they appear in the manuscripts (e.g. pages 8&ndash;12), the
reader must refer to the Schmid edition to see how the notational
system was manipulated to represent octave doubling in organum.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> <p>

[6]  Some acquaintance with the conditions and 
ambiance of ninth
century Carolingian culture is essential to an appreciation of how the
Enchiriadis treatises are constituted and what they accomplish. For
this, Raymond Erickson&rsquo;s 46-page introduction provides stellar
guidance. Besides outlining the content of both treatises, the
introduction covers questions of dating, manuscript transmission,
authorship and provenance, literary sources. For much of this
material, Erickson draws on Nancy Phillips&rsquo;s admirable dissertation, a
debt which he scrupulously acknowledges.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> The section on
&ldquo;Intellectual and Cultural Influences&rdquo; (pages xxxvi&ndash;xlvi) is especially
informative. Here the reader learns of the centrality of grammar and
rhetoric in Carolingian education and institutional life, of
influential musical concepts from Byzantium, of the enduring power of
Boethius, prime Latin expositor of the Greek harmonics tradition, and
chief authority cited by the ME/SE authors. When these strands are
blended with the purposes of articulating the fundamental principles
governing liturgical chant and instructing singers in these
principles, a highly original theory results.<p>


[7] Erickson&rsquo;s translation itself is excellent and renders the Latin
sense intelligibly without being stiffly literal. The numerous
technical terms offer a major challenge. In clarification, Erickson
often provides the Latin term or phrase in parentheses after an
English word or supplies copious notes explaining the range of a term
or referring to other passages in the treatises where it is
employed. Cues throughout the translation to pages in the Schmid
edition facilitate reference to the original language. Besides dealing
with terms, the notes also identify quotations or borrowings from
source writings and refer to manuscript glosses when these shed light
on contemporary interpretations. In the case of an intriguing phrase
by the master of SE &ldquo;things outside [the discipline] to which the
science of singing aptly conforms&rdquo; (<i>extrinsecus occurrentibus
disciplina canendi sese apte conformat</i>) (page 34), Erickson reports 
one
gloss that refers to &ldquo;a good voice&rdquo; and another that invokes the
character (joyful or sad) of a text and its appropriate delivery. He
ventures that if the locution &ldquo;refers to matters discussed in the
treatise, the phrase probably refers to organum, which is not
necessary to the performance of chant and thus is extrinsic to it&rdquo;
(page 34, note 3). Given the full context, I tend to give more credit to
the glosses and to understand the master here as alluding to the many
facets of expert singing, such as vocal quality, delivery in
performance, attention to the character of a text, that cannot be
subsumed under written or rational principles. Organum itself can be
explicated within the discipline, as the subsequent section of the SE
shows.
<p>

[8] Erickson has produced an English version that reads smoothly,
respects the theoretical issues addressed, and preserves the
straightforward tone of the theorists&rsquo;s discourse. In very few
passages would I quibble about the sense conveyed in the
translation. Although relatively minor in import, I cite three
examples to give some notion of the care it takes to render these
ninth-century treatises in modern English.  About 
the middle of Part I
in SE, the master has the student sing the opening of the standard
protus formula from each of the four daseian degrees so that he can
experience for himself the resulting modal transformations. Then the
master has him sing the protus version once again and remarks:<p>

<blockquote>
For present purposes, use whichever type of the protus you want, and
you will note that all melodies sung according to the protus mode end 
on the protus tone. (page 46&ndash;7).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
<p>

<i>Huc adhibe proti quos volueris modos, et videbis omnia, 
quae ad protum modum canuntur, sono proto finiri</i>. (Schmid, page 80.)
</blockquote>
<p>

[9] Although Erickson&rsquo;s rendition is defensible grammatically, I find
it difficult to grasp what might be meant by &ldquo;use whichever type of
the protus you want,&rdquo; as though there were more than one category of
protus. What I take the theorist as conveying is:<p>

<blockquote>
Match this [the protus formula just sung] to any melody whatever in
protus, and you will see that all melodies sung according to the 
protus mode end on the protus tone.
</blockquote>
<p>

The subsequent illustrations for the other three modal categories
confirm the methodology of singing the characteristic modal fragment
(a descending pentachord) and comparing to it melodies known to be in
that mode. The basic thrust is toward aural perception that the
pentachord above the final traversed in melodies of a particular modal
class will align with the standard pentachord unique to that mode.<p>

[10] Another slight hitch occurs when the master is explaining how one
sings at the diapason. After describing such singing with the help of
a diagram, he says:<p>

<blockquote>
For whether one pitch is taken after the other an octave apart or is 
sung simultaneously with two equal-sounding pitches, the song of a simple
diapason is made by this method. (page 54)
<p>

<i>Sive enim alia post aliam per octava loca sumatur, sive in unum 
binis aequisonis vocibus canatur, fit hac ratione cantio diapason 
simplicis</i>. (Schmid, page 91)
</blockquote>
<p>

The provision of &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; as referential noun for &ldquo;<i>alia</i>&rdquo; suggests 
an odd manner of singing a melody in which successive tones seem to be
sung alternately at the lower and upper octaves. Nor does &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; work
well as subject of &ldquo;<i>canatur</i>.&rdquo; It makes more sense to take 
&ldquo;<i>cantio</i>&rdquo; as the implied noun, and to understand the first procedure as
involving alternation between phrases in different registers (the
initial one being repeated at the octave above), the second as
involving concurrent performance in parallel octaves. I would render
the passage:<p>

<blockquote>
For whether one melody [see figure 27] is taken up after the other at
the octave or whether [the melody] is sung simultaneously with two
equal-sounding [i.e., octave] pitches, a song of the simple diapason 
is made by this method. (page 54)
</blockquote>
<p>

Although the diapason has yet to be defined in the treatise as a 2:1
proportion, it may be noted that &ldquo;<i>ratio</i>,&rdquo; rendered appropriately
here as &ldquo;method,&rdquo; also has overtones of &ldquo;ratio,&rdquo; a mathematical
relationship, a meaning made explicit in the third part of the SE.<p>

[11] A particularly thorny passage in the SE is where the pupil
inquires of the master how the first two types of composite organum at
the diapente differ from the first two types of composite organum at
the diatessaron. The answer hinges on the delicate issue of modal
identity, which holds at the fifth, but not at the fourth:<p>
<blockquote>

Indeed, as long as the tropes or modes always recur at the fifth and
at the octave, and as long as the lower voice corresponds with the
upper voice at the diapente in the same category of trope, it is
necessary that there be at the octave a correspondence again with each
voice in the same trope. This is done so that, when the organal voice
is doubled at the diapason and the principal voice is the middle
voice, the lower organal voice is separated from the middle voice by a
fifth and from the upper voice by a fourth, which is the first
composite form of the diapente. (pages 61&ndash;2)
<p>

<i>Siquidem dum quintis et octavis locis semper sit troporum vel 
tonorum reversio, necesse est, ut, dum vox inferior ad superiorem vocem eodem
tropi modo diapente respondet, utrique rursus voci ab octava sua eodem
tropo espondeatur. Fitque, ut organali voce per diapason geminata et
principali voce media vox organalis inferior quintis locis a media
separetur et superior quartis, quod est compositum diapente
primum</i>. (Schmid, page 103).
</blockquote>
<p>

The translation introduces a distinct impression of 
agency&mdash;<i>fitque</i>,
&ldquo;this is done so that <nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;&mdash;and encourages the notion that the modal
correspondence is carried out in order to produce a certain
disposition of intervals between the voices. But the modal
relationships at octave and fifth are systematic and in no way depend
upon the particularities of a specific type of composite organal
singing. I take &ldquo;<i>fitque</i>&rdquo; to be simply descriptive here, &ldquo;hence it
happens [from the modal relationships] that <nobr>. . .</nobr> ,&rdquo; or as a gloss puts
it, &ldquo;the resulting disposition is.&rdquo; A clause has somehow escaped in
the translation also, so that the lower organal voice is said to be
separated from the upper by a fourth, whereas the theorist knows they
stand an octave apart. I would revise the passage thus:<p>

<blockquote>
Indeed, since the recurrence of tropes or modes always takes place at
the fifth and at the octave, it follows necessarily that just as the
lower voice responds at the diapente to the upper voice in the same
category of trope, so in turn their octave doublings respond to each
one of them in the same trope. Hence it happens that when the organal
voice is doubled at the diapason and the principal voice is in the
middle, the lower organal voice is separated from the middle voice by
a fifth and the upper [organal voice] from the middle one by a fourth
[above], which is the first composite form of the diapente.
</blockquote>
<p>

Subsequent passages with parallel language on the second composite
type of diapente organum and on organum at the diatessaron should be
similarly emended.
<p>

[12] The book is well produced, with clear musical examples and nicely
proportioned daseian symbols. I am puzzled, however, why Yale
University Press chose to set the <i>Scolica Enchiriadis</i> in a 
smaller
font than the <i>Musica Enchiriadis</i>. As a result, quotations in SE 
do
not stand out typographically as they do in ME, the musical examples
and their texts are magnified in relation to the surrounding dialogue,
and the treatise itself seems diminished relative to the larger font
of ME and the Introduction. Presumably economic factors entered into
this decision, but the volume would have been handsomer, and SE more
justly served, at least symbolically, had the size of the main font
remained consistent throughout.

<p>

[13] The publication of clear and trustworthy English translations of
the <i>Musica</i> and the <i>Scolica Enchiriadis</i> should be 
celebrated among
those who concern themselves with the early stages of European music
theory. This volume should encourage thoughtful study of these seminal
treatises and should stimulate inquiry into the theoretical problems
they engage.</p>
