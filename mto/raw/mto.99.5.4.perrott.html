<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In 1862, Fetis curtly dismissed the ensemble of theories of his contemporary, Durutte, with the words &ldquo;il suffit de
l&rsquo;expliquer pour le reduire au neant&rdquo; [&ldquo;It suffices to explain it
to reduce it to nothing&rdquo;]. In his recent work, &ldquo;Theories
scientifiques de la musique aux XIXe et XXe si&egrave;cles&rdquo;, Laurent
Fichet proceeds to do just that and, with a candor that may at
times embarrass the more gentle reader, provides a sharp critique
of various and varied attempts over the last two centuries to
espouse a &ldquo;scientific theory of music.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[2] More precisely, Fichet limits himself to the most
significant, poorly understood or ill-known theories from mainly
French and German authors over the last two centuries, that are
based on physics, acoustics, physiology, or mathematics. These
are sciences that can establish facts with objectivity and
certitude, explains Fichet, in contrast to sociology and
psychology, which can often be the object of discussion without
end. We learn that this work should be particularly useful to
musicians, many of whom, either through disinterest or lack of
scientific background, neglect these theories, even those of
their favorite composers. The author&rsquo;s main conclusion is that
most attempts to provide a scientific account of music, whatever
this actually means, are at best quasi-scientific in nature, and
often riddled with incoherence and logical inconsistency. Indeed,
the reader is left to ponder at the end of the work whether it is
at all feasible aspire to such a goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[3] Published in 1996 by Librarie philosophique J. Vrin, the work
appears as the seventh in a series on music and aesthetics.
Broadly speaking, its 382 pages are divided into four sections: a
brief introduction is followed by a hundred or so pages on
nineteenth century theories, leaving the bulk of the work to be
devoted to mathematics- and physics-based theories from the
twentieth century. A twenty-page conclusion attempts to
thematically reunite the preceding sections, after which a
still-curious reader may find a useful annotated bibliography
organized by chapter, an index, and a more detailed description
of the contents than is found at the beginning of the work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[4] Opening with quotes from Rameau that &ldquo;La musique est une
science physico-mathematique&rdquo; [&ldquo;Music is a physico-mathematical
science&rdquo;] and that &ldquo;la simple resonance du Corps Sonore donne la
loi a toute la musique theorique et pratique&rdquo; [&ldquo;the simple
resonance of the Corps Sonore accounts for all music theory and
practice&rdquo;], Fichet overviews the musings of seven post-Ramellian
theorists, ranging from the wonderful to the just plain weird.
The first three&mdash;Alfred Day, Jerome-Joseph de Momigny, Victor
Derode&mdash;unsuccessfully attempt to demonstrate how the chromatic
scale and harmonic practices at the time could be derived from an
analysis of the resonance of the <i>Corps Sonore</i>, and their
theories are variously criticized by Fichet for their
intellectual gymnastics, logical inconsistency, and failure to
correspond to musical reality. The avid reader then takes a trip
into the wonderful world of Baron Blein, who declares with
certitude but without calculation that the primary colours
correspond exactly to the sounds produced by the major chord. The
writings of three more theorists&mdash;Arthur von Oettingen, Anatole
Loquin and E Guyot&mdash;are then briefly overviewed, again merely to
be quickly dismissed as merely speculative in the case of the
first, convoluted in that of the second, and unscientific in that
of the third, whose assertions are excoriated by Fichet for being
&ldquo;as mysterious as they are inconsequential.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[5] The next portrait in this rogues&rsquo; gallery is that of Camille
Durutte. A little known French composer, and epigone of the
Polish mathematician and philosopher, Hoene Wronski, Durutte
introduces the notion of rhythmic numbers, which is the series of
prime numbers and their multiples, from which, he argues, the
true chromatic scale can be derived. To fend off his critics,
Durutte was cleverly able to justify the importance of certain of
these numbers by physiological demonstrations&mdash;three is justified
as a rhythmic number, for example, since the heartbeat moves in
triple time. Amongst the most original of Durutte&rsquo;s ideas, we
learn, are his &ldquo;Loi generatrice des accords&rdquo; (two formulae for
generating every possible chord), and a series of mathematical
principles which purport to distinguish between good and bad
chord sequences. Fichet proceeds by way of example to demonstrate
how Durutte&rsquo;s notions could produce absurd results that would not
even have comported with what musicians regarded as acceptable in
Durutte&rsquo;s own time, and exposes the theorist&rsquo;s attempt to mask
this flaw by judicious selection of self-serving musical
examples.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[6] The second half of the section on nineteenth century theories
of music is devoted to three theorists whose scientific
orientation was physiological in nature: A-J Morel, Charles
Henry, and Hermann von Helmholtz. Few pages are devoted to
discussion of the first, whose theories were based on the
misconception that the timpanic membrane can only perceive one
tone at a time. The ruminations of the second, whose goal was to
realise our destiny in the form of the creation of a universal
harmony, are similarly presented as rather absurd, with Fichet
noting that it was indeed their very lack of seriousness which,
although limiting their weight, had allowed them to evade
systematic criticism for so long. This section of the work
concludes with an overview of the writings of Helmholtz, who
sought to bring together the fields of acoustics, physiology, and
music. Fichet notes that although Helmholtz&rsquo;s theories on
consonance are now obsolete in certain respects, they
nevertheless form the basis of contemporary thought on the
subject. For example, Helmholtz argued that different frequencies
are processed by particular auditory nerve fibres in the same way
as if different piano strings were attached to them, with
approximately 33 fibres per semitone. It is clear that Helmholtz
was at least on the right track, and the main advantage of this
theory, notes Fichet, was that it explained why the ear could be
insensitive to phase differences in the various components of a
sound, for the perception of timbre. An overview is then provided
of Helmholtz&rsquo;s account of consonance and dissonance in terms of
beats, and his classification of various intervals and chords
according to their dissonance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[7] The twentieth-century theories covered in <i>Theories
scientifiques de la musique </i> are subsumed under two categories:
those founded on mathematics, and those based on physics. In the
former group fall Hindemith, Schillinger, Ansermet, Information
Theory, theories influenced by the advent of computer-assisted
sound wave analysis, the theories of Xenakis, and the Set Theory
of Allen Forte; the latter group encompasses theories based on
micro-intervals, spectral music, and the work of Stockhausen.
Concerned to bring an end to the confusion that hitherto reigned
in musical composition, Hindemith proposed several laws of
composition designed to bring an element of certitude to the
discipline, while at the same time maintaining a profound belief
in the total freedom of the compositional process. Like his
nineteenth-century counterparts, Hindemith commenced by
attempting to use the acoustical phenomena of harmonics to derive
the ideal chromatic scale and provide a complete classification
of musical intervals. Hindemith&rsquo;s approach differs from that of
his predecessors in that he does not hold that the harmonic
series is necessarily instantiated in the natural spectrum of
musical instruments, but is more like a mathematical
representation which more or less coincides with it, and he
provides a convoluted algorithm for deriving the notes of the
chromatic scale, which Fichet dismisses as a mere game of numbers
with no scientific basis whatsoever. He then proceeds to show the
internal logical inconsistency of Hindemith&rsquo;s derivation of a
tonal hierarchy, his account of difference tones, his
classification of chords with respect to their dissonance, and
his dismissal of all atonal music. Fichet concludes this section
by arguing that Hindemith&rsquo;s approach on the whole is only
speciously scientific, often based on nothing more than
compositional practice, as the direct expression of human nature,
as if it were as immutable as the physical nature of sounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[8] The next theorist examined by Fichet, Joseph Schillinger,
receives a critique so scathing that one is left to wonder why
his work was ever considered worthy of discussion in the first
place. Schillinger is described as an obscure and mediocre
composer, with a poor musical background, and in the fourteen
pages devoted to summarizing his work it is demonstrated that his
methods have no scientific or mathematical foundation whatsoever,
despite his claim to have established the first scientific system
crossing the threshold of the sanctuary of musical creation.
Lovers of the great masters may be especially interested in the
section describing Schillinger&rsquo;s noble vision to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; the
works of Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, by recomposing them
according to his compositional methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[9] An overview is then provided of phenomenological accounts of
music, which focus upon the mental phenomena arising from the
appearance of music in sounds. Ernest Ansermet, famous conductor
and Swiss phenomenologist, is shown to argue illogically,
inconsistently, and incomprehensibly that the energy from sound
percepts is logarithmic in nature, which he argues to imply of
itself that music must have a tonal center and that the fifth is
of primordial importance in intervallic relations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[10] The next section focuses on application of Shannon and
Weaver&rsquo;s Information Theory to music, by Abraham Moles among
others. The basic idea is that a musical composition is treated
and analyzed into bits of information to be communicated to the
auditor, and that the more structured a piece of music, the more
redundancy it contains and the less original information it
conveys. The main problem that Fichet identifies with this
approach is that it totally ignores the subjective nature of
perception, both between auditors and between epochs, and rests
on the dubious assumption that the brain processes all sensory
information in the same manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[11] Continuing the computer science theme, Fichet next describes
the limited success of the attempts of Hiller, Isaacson, and
Barbaud to design computer programs capable of composing music,
using random number generation within the confines of programmed
harmonic rules, to model the creative aspect of composition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[12] The final two approaches considered under the rubric of
mathematics are the stochastic music of Xenakis, and the set
theory of Allen Forte. The former is more a mode of composition
than a theory as such, and applies a formula derived for
analyzing kinetic energy of gases, to allow manipulation of the
degree of randomness in various aspects of musical composition.
The main problems Fichet identifies with this approach are that:
various degrees of order can still emerge in patterns defined as
random according to the formula; that the formula was not
designed to indicate whether or not a particular pattern would be
perceived by humans as random; and that it prescribes randomness
only for small clusters of notes and not for the way in which
these clusters are then linked together by the composer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[13] Forte&rsquo;s Set Theory is then reviewed, and criticized for its
overly complex nature, that it not does not always provide a
complete analysis of important patterns evident in atonal music,
and that it can sometimes give results that do not comport with
the reality of the music described.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[14] Fichet&rsquo;s analysis of physics-inspired &ldquo;theories&rdquo; of music
consists of an overview of compositional procedures using
micro-intervals and spectral music, as well as a discussion of
Stockhausen&rsquo;s notion of the primacy of time as the overarching
organizational principle in music. Fichet observes here that
these are more a series of scientifically-based observations on
music that may help to create compositions closer to
naturally-occurring sounds, rather than attempts to expound
exhaustive theories of music.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[15] The final section of the text is a twenty-page conclusion,
which Fichet commences by noting the yawning chasm between the
hopes raised by the theories reviewed and the actual progress
they have made to music theory, and that this shortcoming is
particularly apparent for those theories from the preceding
century. In fact, Fichet concludes that the only theorist from
that period to have made any real contribution to music theory
was Helmholtz, with his theory of dissonance. He notes that,
while notions of what is considered &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; have changed
over the last two centuries, this nevertheless does not excuse
the number of mathematical and logical errors and inconsistencies
contained in these purportedly &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; theories of music,
and that several theorists (notably Ansermet) attempted to give a
scientific flavor to their writings in an attempt merely to give
them some credence of rigor and certitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[16] Fichet then notes (without any real substantiation beyond
two quotes from Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper) a movement over
the twentieth century of the decreasing confidence of scientists
in the value of science as a discipline, which renders somewhat
surprising the hopes that certain (unspecified) musicians place
in scientific research. He then questions whether it is even
feasible to ever hope for one scientific theory of music, given
the very large extent to which the notion of what comprises music
is so heavily culturally-mediated. He leaves open the
possibility, however, that there does exist some universal
conception of music, but that we are yet to discover what it is.
It is at this point that Fichet reopens the possibility that
scientific research in other domains&mdash;notably, the psychology of
music perception&mdash;may actually be able to make some useful
contribution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[17] He concludes by noting that the quest over the last two
centuries to produce a scientific account of music has largely
been motivated by the search for an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; music, based in
nature, and declares rather patronizingly that it is regrettable
that artists sometimes take themselves for researchers capable of
discovering in nature immutable laws for their art form, and that
it would be more reasonable for them to &ldquo;find&rdquo; their own music,
taking into account natural constraints, but trusting in their
intuition, guided by a rich cultural background, to thereby
produce <i>une creation feconde</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[18] By way of general appraisal, Fishet&rsquo;s writing style is lucid
and entertaining, and the development of ideas proceeds in a
logical manner throughout the text. Occasionally, however, some
points are too labored (for example, in the section on computer
modeling of composition, Fichet takes three pages to explain the
simple point that it is inappropriate for Barbaud to run his
software several times and then independently select the most
aesthetically pleasing computer output to demonstrate the
effectiveness of his program), and the chapter on Xenakis is at
times repetitious (the point is made several times that while
Xenakis&rsquo; formula indicates the number of each musical phenomenon
that should appear if a work is to be regarded as random, it does
not indicate the exact positioning of the phenomenon with respect
to its neighbors).&nbsp;</p>

<p>[19] The usage of footnotes and illustrations is informative
without distracting from the flow of the text. It would have been
helpful, however, if the abbreviations employed therein were more
clearly defined by initially noting them adjacent to the phrase
they denote. Furthermore, the reader would be better able to
follow the structure of the text had section headings and
subheadings been more clearly differentiated. Finally, given the
author&rsquo;s recognition in his conclusion of the contribution that
other scientific disciplines&mdash;notably psychology&mdash;may bring to
understanding the nature of music, and the manifest inadequacy of
theories proposed in the &ldquo;harder&rdquo; sciences, it would arguably
have been legitimate to include in the work some analysis of
research in these fields over the last century.</p>
