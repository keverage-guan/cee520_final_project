				<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="5"><a style="color:black" href="#AUTHORNOTE1">Wayne Alpern</a></font></span></h2><br><br><p><font size='4'>KEYWORDS: Shreffler, Webern, lyricism, atonality, analysis, sketch study,
  postmodern, vocal works</font></p><p><font size='4'>ABSTRACT: Anne Shreffler&rsquo;s recent book on Webern is a breath of
fresh air in the antiseptic laboratory of more traditional Webern
studies.  Challenging his conventional image as a &ldquo;cerebral
master of control,&rdquo; she paints an intimate portrait of a lyrical
composer of Lieder in the line of Schubert and Wolf, whose
intellectual concern for logical coherence is tempered by an
intuitive appreciation of the expressive potential of ambiguity.
This book presents detailed musicological evidence about Webern&rsquo;s
life and compositional process to substantiate analytical
assertions about his music in support of this lyrical
reappraisal.  There is important new information about the
composer&rsquo;s sketching routine, the precise nature and sequence of
each compositional step, the aesthetic criteria invoked in
revisions, and the essential character of his creative decision
making.  Contrary to analytic approaches that ignore or devalue
ambiguity as a flaw, Shreffler praises the richness of multiple
associations it implies.  Poignantly, it is the quintessentially
structured music of Webern, the paragon of analytic formalism, in
which the author asserts this theoretical imperative.  Her
musical insights and interdisciplinary methodology merit careful
attention and considerable praise.</font></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a name="Section1"><b>Introduction</b></a></p>

<p>[1] It is testimony to Anton Webern&rsquo;s stature that
the contemporary erosion of structural formalism has not
witnessed any concomitant decline of interest in his music.
Attention has shifted rather toward the composer&rsquo;s neglected
expressivity and poetic sensibility.  In <i>Webern and the Lyric
Impulse:  Songs and Fragments on Poems of Georg Trakl</i>, Anne
Shreffler adds momentum to the current swing away from a
traditional structuralist approach.  Her thesis is that the
composer&rsquo;s more intuitive alter ego and the &ldquo;lyric impulse&rdquo; at
the core of his music has been undeservedly overlooked.
Shreffler condemns Webern&rsquo;s exclusive &ldquo;association with a
cerebral, detached aesthetic&rdquo; as a historical bias fostered by
the &ldquo;anti-Romantic agenda of the post-war serialists,&rdquo; an
overreaction against 19th-century sentimentalism, and the
&ldquo;Darmstadt project&rsquo;s&rdquo; reification of systematic relationships in
all music&mdash;particularly St.  Anton&rsquo;s (page 3).<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2] Shreffler&rsquo;s lyrical Webern is no longer the calculating Mr.
Spock of &ldquo;sparseness, severity, and control&rdquo; like the familiar
logical one, an &ldquo;intellectually driven genius&rdquo; (page 4) determined
to extricate himself from the lugubrious excesses of musical
Romanticism.  The meticulous musical engineer who memorized train
schedules, once revered for &ldquo;building structures from sound
itself,&rdquo; is transmogrified into Shreffler&rsquo;s &ldquo;champion of the
lyric genre&rdquo; (page 4), an expressive humanist invoking a keen
poetic sensibility to avert an aesthetic crisis caused by an arid
and overly mechanistic compositional technique.
</p>

<p>[3] Lyrical Webern appeals to our heart, not our brain.  He
implores us to hear his music not as &ldquo;Chinese puzzles&rdquo; to be
deciphered and unraveled, but as emotional experiences to be felt
and savored.  Shreffler conceives of these neglected
compositional traits as manifesting a latent tension within
musical modernism itself.  She dubs Webern&rsquo;s setting of Trakl&rsquo;s
poetry in op. 14 the centerpiece of her study, a
&ldquo;quintessentially modernist work&rdquo; (page 19).  Although the author
does not propose this realignment, however, lyrical Webern can be
filtered through a postmodern, poststructuralist lens as well.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section2"><b>Lyricism</b></a></p>

<p>[4] Lyricism is the gravamen of Shreffler&rsquo;s complaint.
But just what exactly is <i>lyrical</i> about Webern&rsquo;s music?  The
composer once suggested that everything he wrote had an &ldquo;almost
exclusively lyrical nature&rdquo; (page 18).  Yet his music is surely
not &ldquo;lyrical&rdquo; in any ordinary sense of the word&mdash;say like
Puccini&rsquo;s.  Most listeners perceive a poetic stillness in these
enigmatic sounds, a myopic focus on the inner nature of
things&mdash;what Kierkegaard called a sense of &ldquo;passionate
inwardness.&rdquo;  Yet, whatever is lyrical about these haunting
echoes from an intensely personal, private world seems elusive
enough for advocates of opposing aesthetics to appropriate as
evidence of their own agenda.  These are murky waters in which
drifts in trying to assert lyricism as the cornerstone of
Webern&rsquo;s music.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section3"><b>Background</b></a></p>

<p>[5] Shreffler has emerged as a significant
contributor to the renaissance in Webern studies over the past
decade.  Her partiality toward Webern&rsquo;s music presumably played
some role in her own expatriation to Basel, Switzerland, placing
the composer&rsquo;s archives in the Sacher Foundation in her analytic
backyard.  She has co-authored several articles with Felix Meyer,
its knowledgeable curator, including a recent essay on revisions
in Bailey&rsquo;s fine collection.  Shreffler&rsquo;s book joins Bailey&rsquo;s own
analysis of Webern&rsquo;s serial music and Allen Forte&rsquo;s eagerly
awaited study of the atonal works as the only books about this
composer by a single author in the English language in recent
times.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> This alone puts <i>Lyric Impulse</i> on the required reading
list for anyone seriously interested in Webern.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section4"><b>Interdisciplinary Approach</b></a></p>

<p>[6] Shreffler is also one of a small
yet growing band of scholars wearing two hats in an attempt to
bridge the methodological schism between musicology and theory
via &ldquo;historically contextualized analysis.&rdquo;  Musical works are
not approached as insulated, autonomous structures, but as living
texts conditioned by their own historicity.  From this
perspective, the analytic task is not fully satisfied by
discerning abstract structural relationships as though one were
inspecting a crystal in a lab.  It necessitates grounding
analytic inferences in the evolutionary process of actual
creation.  Shreffler&rsquo;s observations about musical structure are
not distilled in a theoretical vacuum, but are wedded empirically
to its genealogy.  Her musicological data carries analytic
import; this is musicologically informed analysis.  For anyone
other than a devout purist of either discipline, the author&rsquo;s
effort to span the interdisciplinary divide via this hybridized
methodology is refreshing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section5"><b>Sketch Study</b></a></p>

<p>[7] Since the conventional image of a logical
Webern arose in a relative musicological void, it is vulnerable
to attack on the grounds that it may be dictated more by
theoretical bias than historical fidelity.  Shreffler appeals
what she condemns as Darmstadt&rsquo;s premature verdict on the grounds
of newly discovered evidence.  She is among the first to peruse
the atonal sketches, particularly for the vocal works of
opp. 12&ndash;18 upon which her study dwells.  In general, her book
falls in the same camp as Bailey&rsquo;s analysis of the serial
sketches by emphasizing their link rather than break with musical
tradition.  It also supplements a growing body of analytic sketch
studies of this and other post-tonal composers.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>

<p>[8] The analytic as opposed to musicological value of sketch
study, of course, has come under attack from those considering it
irrelevant to the autonomous structure of the finished work.
Shreffler&rsquo;s methodological debt to Lewis Lockwood, a leading
sketch advocate and editor of the <i>Studies in Musical Genesis and
Structure</i> series in which this book appears (based upon
Shreffler&rsquo;s 1989 dissertation under Lockwood&rsquo;s direction), is
evident from her unflinching archival commitment.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Unlike
Lockwood, however, Shreffler attempts to circumvent rather than
refute the controversy by disclaiming any objective assertions
about the music itself, and modestly asserting that sketches
merely enrich our own subjective apprehension instead.  She thus
leads with a striking neo-Kantian curtailment of claims:  we can
never know music anyway, but only our perception of it.  The
value of sketch study, Shreffler disarmingly confesses, lies in
the work&rsquo;s &ldquo;reception rather than elucidation&rdquo; (page 12).
</p>

<p>[9] Despite Shreffler&rsquo;s epistemological disclaimer, however, like
most theorists she continues to make what still sound like
objective propositions about the music itself&mdash;not simply about
her subjective impressions.  The legitimate distinction Shreffler
is driving at, though, entails a fruitful shift of focus in
sketch study away from the compositional <i>intent</i> of a revision
to its compositional <i>effect</i>. Instead of trying to burrow inside
the composer&rsquo;s head to divine the subjective reasons for his
choices, we can discern their objective consequences in the
structure of the music itself.
</p>

<p>[10] Whatever the vicissitudes of sketch study, the fact remains
we are still interested in the underlying issue itself, that is,
the complex relationship between the creative process and the
work of art.  Analysis of the score as an isolated entity can
sometimes present a narrow, stoic view that may feel incomplete,
contrived, or unsatisfying.  Sketch study, like the companion
issue of compositional intent, is controversial precisely because
it breaches this modernist requirement of aesthetic autonomy.  In
this sense, sketch study has a postmodern bite, insistently
anchoring analytic abstractions in the terra firma of creative
reality.  In the hands of a skilled practitioner like Shreffler,
who not only makes it her academic business to gain access to
archival sites in remote sectors of the scholarly universe, but
also possesses the musicological and theoretical skills to
construe them in enlightening ways, sketch study can be a
valuable analytic tool.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section6"><b>Antiteleology</b></a></p>

<p>[11] Negating the autonomy of the finished work,
Shreffler shows compensatory respect for the sketches themselves
by rejecting a teleological view of the compositional process.
She cautions against forcing earlier versions of a piece into a
&ldquo;teleological step ladder&rdquo; by demoting them to inherently
inferior stages of creation, progressively purged of their
impurities and &ldquo;culminating in an aesthetically and structurally
perfect work&rdquo; (page 13).  Revisions change a work, but without
necessarily improving it.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Sketches merely represent &ldquo;points
along a continuum [on] a path that could even have taken
different directions&rdquo; in the creative evolution of a work.  Their
analysis reduces &ldquo;our perception of [a piece&rsquo;s] autonomy by
making audible the different voices present at various stages of
its becoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;suggests that a view of Webern&rsquo;s music based
only on the published works is incomplete&rdquo; (page 13).
</p>

<p>[12] Shreffler&rsquo;s attitude toward the creative process parallels
her rejection of the modernist view of music history as a
teleological progression between different styles, in favor of a
postmodern conception that is de-centered, discontinuous,
fragmented, and pluralistic.  History as evolution is replaced by
history as synchronic tension.  Webern&rsquo;s atonality is not an
embryonic, inherently flawed stage of unsystematic musical
chromaticism, eventually shedding its structural deficiencies and
blossoming into the rational totalization of serialism.
Serialism can claim no structural superiority over atonality
simply because it came later.  These are both independent and
fully developed musical languages, premised upon equally valid
but merely different aesthetic criteria.  If anything,
atonality&rsquo;s more ambiguous theoretical premises might account for
its greater longevity in surviving serialism into the postmodern
era.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section7"><b>Compositional Process</b></a></p>

<p>[13] Shreffler traces the successive
stages of Webern&rsquo;s compositional process through motivic
fragments, continuity drafts, revision copies, and printer&rsquo;s
copies, in each step carefully monitoring his musical methods and
choices.  We learn that he customarily began composing by
intuitively conceiving a short, striking musical gesture which
then became the opening idea of the piece.  Webern next extended
this motivic cell into a single, monophonic vocal line, from
which he then generated the remainder of the piece.  Accompanying
instrumental parts were added only after he first completed the
vocal line, as opposed to vertically coordinating all the parts
together at the same time.
</p>

<p>[14] This contrapuntal layering of successive parts is visually
evidenced by discernible vertical misalignments between
individual lines in the sketches shown in the book.  It is also
conspicuously reminiscent of similar vertical misalignments
between successively conceived voices in the music of Heinrich
Isaac, whom Webern notably admired.  Shreffler construes this
cumulation of independent melodic strands as revealing a
predominately linear approach to polyphony, which she in turn
attributes to the essential lyricism of Webern&rsquo;s musical
conception.  She further extrapolates that the composer&rsquo;s lack of
interest in combinatoriality in his later serial works manifests
this same lyric orientation, inducing him to conceive of rows
primarily from a horizontal and melodic perspective rather than a
vertical or harmonic one.
</p>

<p>[15] Other crucial aspects of the sketches support Shreffler&rsquo;s
revised conception of a lyrical Webern as well.  Instead of
deliberating intensely over each painstaking note as one might
imagine, he actually seems to have jotted his musical ideas down
rather quickly, fluidly, and intuitively, revising if at all on
the spot.  In fact, there is virtually no evidence that he ever
reworked or even revisited previously sketched material during
this atonal period at all.  His entire approach to composing
appears to be based instead upon free transformations in a
through-composed, &ldquo;stream-of consciousness-like fashion&rdquo; (page
234), as opposed to any rigorous, intellectual, systematic
procedures that might appeal to logical Webern.
</p>

<p>[16] Given the intricate structure of the musical outcome, it is
nothing short of astonishing that Webern&rsquo;s atonal sketches, like
Schoenberg&rsquo;s, reveal absolutely no precompositional aids,
schemes, charts, plans, or diagrams suggestive of any systematic
approach whatsoever.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> They also suggest as much concern with
purely expressive elements on the musical surface, such as
contour, register, texture, and orchestration, as they do with
underlying pitch structures.  Rehearsal and performance materials
confirm Webern&rsquo;s preference for an expressive performance style
far removed from antiseptic precision of Boulezian modernist
performance practice.  Finally, of greatest interest to
theorists, contrary to the hallowed image of the composer in
single-minded pursuit of rational order and coherence,
Shreffler&rsquo;s study reveals that Webern at times deliberately
sought out ambiguity and disorder for their lyrical potential.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section8"><b>Vocal Works</b></a></p>

<p>[17] Shreffler contends that the vocal works of
Webern&rsquo;s middle period, &ldquo;the vocal decade&rdquo; from 1914&ndash;1924
comprising half his total output, &ldquo;have simply been bracketed out
of the Webern canon&rdquo; because they are incompatible with the
conventional image of a logical Webern (page 4).  She argues that
these &ldquo;forgotten works&rdquo; contain an essential lyric ingredient
rather than a logical one, that &ldquo;lies at the heart of all his
music&rdquo; (page 18), and accordingly warrant a radical reappraisal of
the composer&rsquo;s evolution.
</p>

<p>[18] Shreffler detects a subtle shift from the static
pointillistic textures of free atonality in Webern&rsquo;s early
pre-war instrumental pieces to the more extended linear
counterpoint in the later works after 1924.  She attributes this
transition not to Schoenberg&rsquo;s serialism, but rather to Webern&rsquo;s
discovery of lyricism during the intervening vocal period.  The
crisis in Webern&rsquo;s career was not his later stylistic
confrontation with his mentor&rsquo;s methodology and his need to
develop a personal serial voice, but rather his more elemental
need to develop a basic contrapuntal and melodic technique.  The
specific manner in which Webern confronted this fundamental
challenge&mdash;by learning how to write a flowing lyrical atonal line
in a vocal setting&mdash;set the stage for how he later addressed
serialism as well.
</p>

<p>[19] According to Shreffler, Webern&rsquo;s initial atonal period from
1908&ndash;14 hit a dead end in musical miniaturism because his
compositional technique was basically incapable of sustaining an
extended melodic line, and thus generating bona fide
counterpoint.  These early aphoristic pieces from opp. 5&ndash;11 are
&ldquo;not contrapuntal and could not be,&rdquo; in the sense of combining
independent, self-sufficient horizontal melodies (page 107).  They
have an essentially vertical construction based upon the static
&ldquo;juxtaposition of non-overlapping musical ideas&rdquo; and &ldquo;isolated
gestures,&rdquo; creating more of a timbral mosaic than a contrapuntal
web.  Even in those works that &ldquo;seem contrapuntal&rdquo; like op. 5/3,
Shreffler contends that the apparent parts are really only
&ldquo;quasi-independent layers rather than truly autonomous, self
sustaining polyphonic melodic voices.&rdquo;  In short, Webern really
didn&rsquo;t know at this stage &ldquo;how to maintain the total chromatic in
a contrapuntal context&rdquo; (pages 107&ndash;08).
</p>

<p>[20] Shreffler argues that the composer turned in desperation to
song as a way out of this musical cul de sac.  The continuity of
the words in a poetic text necessitated horizontal thinking and a
more fluid melodic approach.  Writing vocal music in a
declamatory style, to which Webern exclusively devoted himself
for ten years, led to a more integrated linear style, as opposed
to the fractured juxtaposition of autonomous cells in the earlier
instrumental pieces.  Projecting the long lines of a poem with a
sustained melody, from which the other parts organically derived,
not only led out of the atonal impasse, but eventually blossomed
into a linear, melodic, or &ldquo;lyrical&rdquo; approach to serialism.
Webern&rsquo;s experience in writing through composed vocal music thus
&ldquo;predisposed&rdquo; him to &ldquo;writing rows melodically and accompanying
them with similar linear figures&rdquo; (page 18).<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section9"><b>Disjunct Lyricism</b></a></p>

<p>[21] Shreffler discerns that Webern&rsquo;s final
serial period represents a synthesis between the disjunction of
his early period and the lyricism of his middle period,
culminating in a hybrid &ldquo;disjunct lyricism.&rdquo;  He eventually
blended the aphoristic, verticalized pointillism of the
instrumental miniatures with the fluid, horizontal counterpoint
of his songs.  After learning how to write extended atonal
melodies in his vocal works with the mimetic aid of a text,
Webern reabsorbed his earlier fragmented instrumental style by
&ldquo;refracturing&rdquo; these vocalized melodies, or &ldquo;instrumentalizing&rdquo;
the vocal line.  He thus employed the voice first to achieve a
lyrical style, and then proceeded to logically deconstruct it
again.
</p>

<p>[22] Shreffler places op. 14, <i>Six Songs on Poems by Georg
Trakl</i> at the musical juncture between these opposing lyrical and
logical approaches.  But it was only the latter impulse of the
first and last periods, without the opposing melodious, lyrical
impulse of the middle vocal period that tempered it, that the
Darmstadters seized upon and reified in trimming Webern&rsquo;s
aesthetic to fit their own formalist conceit.  Armed with
empirical evidence from the composer&rsquo;s newly discovered sketches,
Shreffler seeks to redress this historical imbalance by elevating
lyrical Webern to a level of parity with his logical counterpart.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section10"><b>Analytic Approach</b></a></p>

<p>[23] Shreffler devotes over half her book to
dissecting op. 14 in light of its sketches to furnish analytic
support for her claim.  Although another reviewer scurrilously
castigated her for exploiting the &ldquo;babble-prose of Power
Analysis,&rdquo; the terminology she invokes is conventional set
theory.  While many theorists will enjoy competent analyses
conducted by an astute musicologist with archival details at her
fingertips, others might miss a bit more technical sophistication
at this evidentiary stage of her case.  To be fair, though, there
are few scholars capable of combining comprehensive archival
skills with a mastery of high-voltage analytic techniques, and
one probably ought not expect Shreffler or anyone else for that
matter to excel in both.
</p>

<p>[24] Given the ambitious methodological scope of her endeavor and
the controversial nature of her allegations, however, a broader
analytic pallet might help at times.  The author&rsquo;s analyses
essentially are confined to foreground relationships on the
musical surface.  They could be enhanced by penetrating to deeper
structural levels and adopting a more &ldquo;transformational
attitude.&rdquo;  For the most part, though, Shreffler makes an able
case with the means she invokes.  The book&rsquo;s technical
limitations also assure that there are no intimidating
theoretical impediments to its apprehension by the expanded
audience of musicologists and theorists it is designed to
address.
</p>

<p>[25] One of the inherent consequences of Shreffler&rsquo;s
interdisciplinary approach is the relinquishment of excessive
technicality in either direction.  While some musicologists may
find her invoking analytic &ldquo;babble-prose,&rdquo; some theorists may
discern insufficient analytic evidence to substantiate her
claims.  To anyone who values communication beyond increasingly
narrow occupational walls, however, Shreffler&rsquo;s style is
exemplary.  A more complex theoretical apparatus might easily
compromise not only her hybridized methodology, but her thesis of
an approachable, less systematic, lyrical Webern.
</p>

<p>[26] Still, Shreffler&rsquo;s discussion of op. 14/4&rsquo;s <i>Abendland III</i>
is one spot where a heftier analytic toolchest would help.  Her
contention is that the piece reflects a significant change in
compositional technique away from the fragmented juxtaposition of
cells towards an integrated, linear contrapuntal web.  Attempting
to show the organic derivation of instrumental parts from the
lyrical vocal line, she extracts a handful of disparate
referential sets from the initial vocal gesture&mdash;(56E), (3456),
(456E), (E056), and (E3456)&mdash;which she then designates as a
single collective referential motive.
</p>

<p>[27] Acknowledging that these constituent sets are &ldquo;not formally
equivalent,&rdquo; Shreffler nonetheless argues that they &ldquo;are
functionally so because of their common origin&rdquo; in the vocal
phrase (page 163).  Her analysis here, as well as throughout,
could be reinforced by identifying prime forms, instead of merely
normal orders.  Boiling these down to (016), (0123), (0127),
(0167), and (01237) makes things a lot clearer, and highlights
their invariant subset relationships.  More seriously, however,
she restricts herself to locating local recurrences of these
different sets on the musical surface, which she then submits as
evidence of an organic contrapuntal style manifesting Webern&rsquo;s
lyric impulse.
</p>

<p>[28] But Shreffler casts too wide a net.  Other than their common
origin in the initial vocal gesture, there is little analytic
payoff derived from noting the subsequent recurrence of so many
sets in the instrumental parts.  Motivic saturation in itself
reveals nothing unique about this particular piece.  Numerous
first period works reveal the same saturation derived from an
opening gesture.  Without some further demonstration of how these
sets link up to one another at deeper levels of structure, it is
not exactly clear how this piece &ldquo;represents a breakthrough in
Webern&rsquo;s handling of motivic atonality<nobr> . . . </nobr>changing how
motives relate to each other&rdquo; (page 174), let alone reflecting
anything notably lyrical.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section11"><b>Embellishments</b></a></p>

<p>[29] In other instances, Shreffler&rsquo;s sketch
evidence alone provides a valuable springboard for further
analyses bolstering her contention that Webern was not
exclusively concerned with achieving maximal structure and order.
The revisions of op. 14/3&rsquo;s <i>Abendland II</i>, for example, reveal
that the composer actually sabotaged long-range coherence to
achieve a more expressive local effect.  The beginning of the
piece presents a pair of (01) dyads, [C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] followed by [D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] at
T2.  The end presents two (014) trichords at the same pitch
levels, [C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-E] and [D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>], also related at the same
transpositional level.
</p>

<p>[30] Shreffler partitions out the semitone dyads [C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] and
[D-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] within each trichord to show their equivalence with the
opening dyads.  She accounts for the nonconforming E and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> at
the end as &ldquo;imbedded modifications&rdquo; of the initial dyadic idea.
In an earlier sketch, however, she notes in passing that the
opening [C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>] dyad was originally preceded by an E, thus
presenting a [C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-E] trichord both at the beginning and the
end.  A reasonable inference could be drawn that the sketch was
therefore actually more unified by a long-range structural
relationship than the revision.  By lopping off the initial E,
Webern disrupted the equivalency between opening and closing
trichords, opting in favor of a more local association between
dyads at the expense of large-scale unification.
</p>

<p>[31] Shreffler&rsquo;s impressive archival excavation of three
different sketches of the opening vocal gesture of op. 14/1&rsquo;s <i>Die
Sonne</i> also affords additional analytic inferences in support of
her thesis of a lyrical Webern.  Each of the three preliminary
versions of the phrase is internally unified by an equivalency
relationship between two constituent sets.  In the final version,
however, Webern again ruptured this internal symmetry by
juxtaposing two disparate sets instead.  This revision also
suggests a preference for lyrical disorder over logical order,
supporting the revised conception of the composer Shreffler
proposes.  This compositional orientation of undermining rather
than promoting logical coherence is subtly summed up in the final
gesture of the finished work as well.  A note-for-note
equivalency relationship unfolding progressively between two sets
is ultimately derailed by the last two notes of the piece in a
dramatic crescendo.  The deliberate disruption in the revision
process thus provides a useful analytic paradigm for
comprehending structural aberrations in the final score, too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section12"><b>Proto-Serialism</b></a></p>

<p>[32] Shreffler falters uncharacteristically in
her otherwise convincing attempt to show that Webern was not
immediately enamored with serial techniques.  According to her,
shortly after Schoenberg first serialized op. 25, Webern
sketched a quasi-serial &ldquo;near retrograde&rdquo; in op. 14/1 between the
pentachordal segments &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-F-E&gt; and &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-C-Eb-D-G&gt; (page 234),
which he later threw away.  Shreffler contends that the fact that
Webern &ldquo;rejected an operation similar to those found in serial
pieces indicates that he was not following a system&rdquo; (page 234),
and thereby manifests his sense of lyrical confinement and
dissatisfaction with systematic logic.  But while Shreffler&rsquo;s
hypothesis of Webern&rsquo;s lukewarm reception of serialism may be
correct, this is not the best evidence.
</p>

<p>[33] At the outset, these two pentachords are not
&ldquo;near-retrogrades&rdquo; as Shreffler claims, but rather
&ldquo;near-retrograde inversions&rdquo; at RI5.  Their <i>ordered pitch-class
interval successions</i>, &lt;-5-1+3-1&gt; and &lt;-1+3-1+5&gt;, are
near-retrogrades, not retrograde inversions as they must be to
make the pitch segments themselves near-retrogrades.  This is a
minor oversight that might actually support Shreffler&rsquo;s argument,
however, since the abandoned RI relationship is even stronger
evidence of a serial state of mind than a mere retrograde.
</p>

<p>[34] But Shreffler&rsquo;s case is seriously jeopardized by the fact
that the two segments are more directly heard as
near-transpositions or traditional canonic imitations.  The first
four notes of the second pentachord, &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-C <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D&gt;, form an exact
transposition down a whole step of the first pentachord starting
on its second note, &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-F-E&gt;, with the same &lt;-1+3 1&gt; interval
succession.  Moreover, this is succeeded by another
transpositional entrance down another whole step of a third
pentachord &lt;B-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-A&gt;, whose first four notes transpose those
of the first pentachord exactly from its beginning, again with
the same intervals &lt;-5 1+3&gt;.  In light of this conventional
transpositional scheme, Shreffler&rsquo;s contention that lyrical
Webern was rebelling against Schoenberg&rsquo;s logically ordered
retrogrades and inversions when he abandoned this sketch seems to
attack a straw man.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section13"><b>Progressive Transformations</b></a></p>

<p>[35] Transformational analysis with
a dose of &ldquo;fuzzy logic,&rdquo; however, confirms that these three
near-equivalent pentachords are in fact systematically related by
a <i>progressive transformation</i> or &ldquo;P-transformation.&rdquo;  A
&ldquo;P-transformation&rdquo; is a recurrent &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo; operation without the
strict equivalency requirement of conventional &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo;
functions on one hand, but which formalizes the vagueness of
&ldquo;near-transformations&rdquo; by specifying the precise degree of
relatedness on the other.  Any transformation can be applied
recursively or cyclically through incremental stages by
progressively increasing or decreasing the number of notes
participating as a subset in the operation.
</p>

<p>[36] Canonic serial operations, for example, can be defined
progressively as &ldquo;progressive-transposition (PnT),&rdquo;
&ldquo;progressive-inversion (PnI),&rdquo; &ldquo;progressive-retrograde (PnR),&rdquo;
and &ldquo;progressive-retrograde inversion (PnRI),&rdquo; where n equals the
size or cardinality of the participatory subset of equivalent
notes between two near-equivalent sets.  The value of n also
represents the number of the successive application or
&ldquo;run-though&rdquo; of the transformation in a sequence, ranging from
(1, 2<nobr> . . . </nobr>m), with m equal to the maximum cardinality of the
entire set, at which point the progressive transformation is
identical to the normal equivalency operation.  P transformations
flush out the continuum of transformational increments between
the &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; of strict equivalency relationships.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>

<p>[37] PnRI successively retrogrades the interval succession of the
three pentachordal segments in Webern&rsquo;s op. 14/1 sketch, but
progressively inverts only n of their members at a time.  The
first run-through, P1RI, retrogrades the entire intervallic
succession &lt;-5-1+3-1&gt; of the first pentachord &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-F-E&gt;, but
inverts only its first interval.  This generates &lt;-1+3-1+5&gt;, the
interval succession of the second pentachord, &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-G&gt;.  The
descending fourth &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&gt; at the beginning of the first
pentachord thus becomes the ascending fourth &lt;D-G&gt; at the end of
the second, while the transpositionally invariant tetrachords
&lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D-F-E&gt; and &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-C-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-D&gt; remain intact.
</p>

<p>[38] The second progressive application, P2RI, then retrogrades
the output of P1RI, but this time inverts just its first and last
intervals.  This generates &lt;-5-1+3+1&gt;, the interval succession of
the third pentachord, &lt;B-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-F-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-A&gt;.  Now the first and third
pentachords share a transpositionally invariant tetrachord at
their beginning, with the descending semitone &lt;F-E&gt; at the end of
the first pentachord matching the ascending semitone &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-A&gt; at
the end of the third pentachord.  The three segments of Webern&rsquo;s
sketch thus comprise a coherent transformational network
logically organized by a single progressive transformation.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup></p>

<p>[39] But regardless of the means of structural integration in
this sketch, Shreffler&rsquo;s conclusion is warranted by its most
crucial point:  its abandonment.  Webern ultimately disrupted
even the fuzziest logic by tossing out the second pentachord
altogether and substituting a structurally anomalous and
inexplicable &lt;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-G-C&gt; trichord in the final version instead.  The
underlying compositional process here as before reveals the
composer deliberately revising his sketches to instill greater
ambiguity rather than order through the distortion or
&ldquo;fuzzification&rdquo; of a logical scheme.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section14"><b>Multi-Referentiality</b></a></p>

<p>[40] This instantiates Shreffler&rsquo;s pivotal
notion of &ldquo;multiple reference,&rdquo; a term she coins to indicate that
Webern&rsquo;s atonal pitch structures often associate flexibly or
perhaps &ldquo;lyrically&rdquo; with each other in a loose family or &ldquo;network
of references&rdquo; based upon similarity or resemblance rather than
strict, systematic equivalence, somewhat akin to Schoenbergian
&ldquo;developing variation.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> The &ldquo;richness of associations&rdquo;
(page 242) through multiple references compensates for the
relinquishment of precision.  &ldquo;Even some of [Webern&rsquo;s] most
strictly controlled works have elements of ambiguity,&rdquo; she
observes, and goes on to cite the unexpected exploration of the
&ldquo;possibilities of row disorder&rdquo; in his serial music as well
(page 4).
</p>

<p>[41] The compositional process suggested by these sketches of
ambiguating or &ldquo;dissonating&rdquo; the normative regularity of a
structural idea alters the composer&rsquo;s traditional image as a
calculating precisionist invariably seeking total coherence and
organic unification.  It transforms the familiar portrait of
logical Webern into his lyrical alter ego trying to stretch
beyond the restrictive confines of his intellect in pursuit of
the expressive potential of ambiguity.  It also flips the
compositional process on its head as a process of deconstruction
rather than construction.  Instead of logically integrating,
purifying, and rationally shaping an initial, amorphous,
intuitive idea through the progressive refinement of its
structural imperfections, Webern at other times appears to have
employed the inverse process.  He intentionally blurred the logic
of systematic prototypes in order to translate the fractured
syntax and juxtaposed metaphors of Trakl&rsquo;s expressionist poetry
into the disassociated discourse of free atonality.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>

<p>[42] Must the act of composing or theorizing inevitably imply
defeating incongruities by bending them into conformity with some
totalizing principle?  Is aesthetic value always dependent upon
what Derrida calls the &ldquo;illusion of a centered structure?&rdquo;
Ironically, it is the music of Webern, this paragon of logical
refinement, that suggests not.  In presenting this reappraisal,
Shreffler invokes a more magnanimous conception not only of his
music, but of music generally&mdash;one that embraces the beauty of
&ldquo;crippled symmetry&rdquo; and invites us to celebrate flaws and
wrinkles instead of always trying to &ldquo;iron them out.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>Ambiguity is not always a shortcoming.  It can serve an
expressive function comparable to dissonance in a normative
context of structural coherence.  As Robert Morris points out,
conflict rather than unity &ldquo;can be at the heart&rdquo; of a piece.
When &ldquo;one does not quite grasp how [music] works,&rdquo; observes David
Lewin, he listens &ldquo;with added, rather than dissipating,
interest.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a NAME="Section15"><b>Conclusion</b></a></p>

<p>[43] Theorists and musicologists alike owe Anne
Shreffler a debt of gratitude:  she has lyricized Webern and, in
a sense, the analytic endeavor itself.  Shreffler&rsquo;s book serves
as a necessary reminder that even St.  Anton was not always in
the business of organizing every single note so that it conformed
to some coherent theoretical account.  As Stravinsky once half
quipped, &ldquo;only mediocre composers are consistent.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>

<p>[44] At the same time, however, Shreffler&rsquo;s lesson in lyricism
ought not disrupt one dogma only to substitute another.  Her new
lyrical Webern need not diminish our appreciation of the old
logical one as well, as she herself concedes.  An occasional
absence of crisp set-class equivalence does not necessarily imply
chaos or preclude some other form of rational organization.
There are many other significant unifying factors and criteria
for musical comprehensibility, particularly with respect to how a
piece is heard.  Moreover, fuzzy logic and progressive
transformations suggest that lyricism and even ambiguity may be
achieved through logical means themselves.  Lest we forget that
logical Webern wrote &ldquo;even the most fragmented sounds must have a
completely coherent effect.&rdquo;  Still, at other times lyrical
Webern described having &ldquo;an intuitive vision of the work as a
whole<nobr> . . . </nobr>inspiration, if you like.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Lockwood is wise to
counsel sober equilibrium in his preface to Shreffler&rsquo;s book,
finding Webern&rsquo;s &ldquo;lyric impulses tempered at every step by
concerns with coherence and structure&rdquo; (page vi).
</p>

<p>[45] Our two Weberns, one logical the other lyrical, exist side
by side.  Both are real and necessary to our full recognition of
their collaborative achievement.  But in the end, of course,
there is only one real Webern&mdash;and he is both together,
delicately balanced in a steady state of logical lyricism.  It is
his music&rsquo;s symbiosis between rationality and intuition, its
precarious dialectic between order and expressivity, uniting what
Levi Strauss called &ldquo;the contrary attributes of being both
intelligible and untranslatable,&rdquo; that instills its special
mystique.  This paradox earns Webern&rsquo;s rank and resilience
despite shifts in analytic paradigms across the poststructural
divide.  For how else can the same composer be claimed by
contrary aesthetics?  Bach, in Webern&rsquo;s time, was appropriated by
competing factions.  Now Webern seems to have sufficient breadth
to be appreciated from different and even opposing perspectives.
These oscillating views exist simultaneously in our minds and the
music itself.  Analysis is simply &ldquo;a selection,&rdquo; as Leo Treitler
once wrote, &ldquo;from all the true things that may be said&rdquo; about a
work of art.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p>[46] Despite his advocacy of Darmstadt orthodoxy, Karlheinz
Stockhausen nonetheless espoused tolerant catholicity toward
Webern&rsquo;s music.  As if anticipating Shreffler&rsquo;s heretic
reappraisal nearly a half century later, <i>die Riehe&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;enfante
terrible&rdquo; confessed on the tenth anniversary of the composer&rsquo;s
death:  &ldquo;We have been accused of doing violence to Webern&rsquo;s music
by reading into it something that is not there at all.  There is
not one interpretation but as many as there are points of view.
The fact that everyone discovers something different in his music
and wishes to demonstrate it to others throws a useful light on
the manifold ideas about Webern; and that above all, his music
allows of interpretation from the most varied points of view
speaks only for its vitality.  Let us concern ourselves with our
common task, for it is unfruitful to make out of it a clash of
philosophies.  The matter at hand is to acquire a knowledge of
the actual contents of Webern&rsquo;s scores, to quicken our perception
of it, looking from every possible angle.  Not everything that
cries out for contradiction should be taken too seriously.  And
every musician who loves this music may feel it his duty
untiringly to bring it nearer to others, to communicate the joy
he feels at having discovered it.  Then Webern&rsquo;s music will be
able gradually to radiate its innermost power, by drawing people
together in shared astonishment at such beauty.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

18.2 (fall, 1996):  167&ndash;99, and also in Bartok&rsquo;s music in Laszlo
Somfai, <i>Bela Bartok:  Composition, Concepts, and Autograph
Sources</i> (Berkeley:  California University Press, 1996):  81&ndash;82.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Shreffler thereby links this study with her previous research
showing that Webern&rsquo;s first serial effort in op. 15/4 emerged
directly out of a vocal line.  &ldquo;&lsquo;Mein Weg geht jetzt vorueber&rsquo;:
The Vocal Origins of Webern&rsquo;s Twelve Tone Composition,&rdquo; <i>Journal
of the American Musicological Society</i> 47 (1994):  275&ndash;338.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">For purposes of clarity, directed intervals (+ and -)
instead of conventionally uniformly ascending intervals are used
to denote pitch class intervals, not pitch intervals, i.e., -5 =
7.  The prime forms of these three sets are 5-4 (01236), 5-7
(01237), and 5-10 (01346).</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">David Lewin discusses progressive and partial transformations in a
different context in <i>Generalized Musical Intervals and
Transformations</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987): 125&ndash;28,
141&ndash;43.  Joseph Straus explores near transformations in &ldquo;Voice Leading
in Atonal Music,&ldquo; Baker, <i>Music Theory in Concept:</i> 237&ndash;74.  Ian
Quinn, &ldquo;Fuzzy Extensions to the Theory of Contour,&rdquo; <i>Music Theory
Spectrum</i> 19.2 (fall, 1997): 232&ndash;63, offers a &ldquo;Fuzzy Tutorial&rdquo; to
analyze &ldquo;slight alterations&rdquo; in Steve Reich&rsquo;s music.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">P3RI would retrograde the previous output, this time
inverting just its first, second, and fourth intervals to
generate &lt;-1+3+1+5&gt;.  P4RI would in turn retrograde that, finally
inverting all its intervals, just like a conventionally crisp RI
equivalency relationship to generate &lt;-5-1-3+1&gt;.  In conventional
pci notation, P1RI &lt;7-11-3-11&gt; = &lt;11-3-11-5&gt;, P2RI &lt;11 3-11-5&gt; =
&lt;7-11-3-1&gt;, P3RI &lt;7-11-3-1&gt; = &lt;11-3-1-5&gt;, P4RI &lt;11-3-1-5&gt; =
&lt;7-11-9-1&gt;.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Shreffler&rsquo;s central theme of &ldquo;multiple reference&rdquo; acknowledges
affinity with Arnold Whittall&rsquo;s &ldquo;multiple meaning&rdquo; in &ldquo;Webern and
Multiple Meaning,&rdquo; <i>Music Analysis</i> 6 (1987): 333&ndash;53, which in turn
cites Schoenberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;multiple harmonic meaning&rdquo; in <i>Structural
Functions of Harmony</i> (New York: W.W. Norton, 1969): 168.  See also Janna
Saslaw and James Walsh, &ldquo;Musical Invariance as a Cognitive Structure:

the Age of Romanticism</i>, ed.  Ian Bent (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1996): 211&ndash;32.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Stravinsky&rsquo;s and Bartok&rsquo;s sketches also were often simpler,
classical prototypes or &ldquo;Urforms&rdquo; transformed to become
increasingly free and remote from their normative structural
origins.  Joseph Straus, &ldquo;The Progress of a Motive in
Stravinsky&rsquo;s The Rake&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; <i>The Journal of Musicology</i> 9
