1960s&mdash;represented by pieces such as <i>Threnody</i>, <i>Fluorescences</i>, <i>Polymorphia</i>,
and others&mdash;Penderecki employed a compositional system whose axiomatic concept
was not a single sound, but the sound matter in its totality. Distinct states of
this sound matter were governed by two relatively independent systems: (1) a
basic system which ruled the texture of sound masses and (2) a timbre system
governing their sound color. Categories of the basic system are a few binary
oppositions concerning pitch, time, and loudness: spatial mobility vs.
immobility, temporal mobility vs. immobility, spatial continuity vs.
discontinuity, temporal continuity vs. discontinuity, high vs. low register,
loud vs. soft dynamics. These categories account for the morphology of the basic
system because a combination of terms chosen from individual categories
generates an inventory of units in Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic style. The same set
of categories also determines syntax, as the temporal order of units in the
course of musical narration is ruled by the internal logic of individual binary
oppositions. Categories of the timbre system are in turn metal, wood, and
leather&mdash;materials of which the sound sources of traditional musical instruments
are most often made&mdash;forming a ternary opposition. The timbre system underlies
the wealth of new musical tools as well as eccentric playing techniques on
traditional instruments called for by the composer.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Penderecki&rsquo;s music of the 1960s, known in Poland under the name of
&ldquo;sonorism&rdquo; and represented by such famous pieces as <i>Threnody-To the
Victims of Hiroshima</i>, <i>Polymorphia</i> or <i>Fluorescences</i>, is based
on a compositional system of a very particular sort. Its particularity lies in
the fact that the axiom here is not a concept of a single sound event, but of
sound matter taken in its totality&mdash;<i>en masse</i>, so to say. As a
consequence, this system governs relations not between individual sounds but
between sound masses. These relations are qualified in respect of texture and
timbre. Accordingly, Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic system consists of two subsystems:
one that rules texture of sound masses and that I call &ldquo;basic system,&rdquo;
and the other that accounts for their timbres which is called by me
&ldquo;timbre system.&rdquo; In what follows, I will concentrate on the basic
system alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[2] The basic system concerns three of the four parameters of auditory
perception: loudness, pitch, and time. On those parameters, categories of the
basic system are founded, each of them established by a binary opposition (see <b>Table 1</b>).</p>
<p>[3] Opposition between spatial continuity and discontinuity denotes here a
relation between bands and individually discernible points on the perceptual
axis of pitches. Temporal continuity vs. discontinuity is an opposition between
lasting sounds and momentary impulses as, respectively, sections and points on
the temporal axis. Spatial mobility means a perception of pitch change, and
temporal mobility is tantamount to rhythm in traditional musical terminology. To
understand the way in which these categories operate within the system, it is
necessary to examine their inner logical structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[4] The binary oppositions listed in the table take shape as either
contradiction or contrariety. Contradiction is an opposition which classifies
every possible phenomenon under either of its opposite terms, <i>tertium non
datur</i>. Mathematically, it can be thus modeled as a relation between a given
set and its complement (<b>Figure 1</b>). This
type of opposition is represented by spatial continuity vs. discontinuity,
temporal continuity vs. discontinuity, spatial mobility vs. immobility, temporal
mobility vs. immobility. Contrariety, on the other hand, forms an opposition in
which <i>tertium datur</i>, that is, which allows for phenomena to be classified
under neither term of the opposition itself. In Penderecki&rsquo;s basic system, it is
represented by high vs. low register (because there also exists middle register)
and loud vs. soft dynamics (because dynamics can also be medium). The
mathematical model of contrariety is thus a relation of two sets, each of them
belonging to the complement of the other (<b>Figure
2</b>).</p>
<p>[5] However, the figures just presented are not quite adequate models of
Penderecki&rsquo;s categories. This is so since both contradictions and contrarieties
of the basic system are relations of fuzzy, and not classical, logic and
therefore should be modeled by fuzzy, and not ordinary, sets.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> In fuzzy sets, the discrimination between their elements and non-elements is
obscured. Classical cases of fuzzy sets are thus designated by terms of both
contrarieties: high vs. low register and loud vs. soft dynamics. Clearly, one
cannot indicate any single frequency value at which low register ends or at
which high register starts. Similarly, there is no such a thing as an upper
intensity border of soft dynamics or a lower intensity border of loud dynamics.
Rather than border-lines, we have here border-zones of values that&mdash;in different
contexts&mdash;can be classified as either belonging or not belonging to a given set
within an individual category (<b>Figure 4</b>).</p>


<p>[6] As regards contradictions, the reason for their fuzziness lies in the
fact that they&mdash;as all the categories of Penderecki&rsquo;s basic system&mdash;are
perceptual, and not acoustical. And, even if acoustically it is always possible
to classify a given sound under one term of a given contradiction, it might
often be impossible for a listener to decide unequivocally how&mdash;in the framework
of this opposition&mdash;to classify a sound phenomenon just perceived. For instance,
glissando is a spatially mobile phenomenon. But if its speed is being gradually
reduced, then, at some point, the listener will hesitate whether it is still a
glissando or rather a long-lasting&mdash;and thus spatially immobile&mdash;pitch. Its
classification will thus vary, depending on the context and aural abilities of
the listener. As a result, again, the border-line between opposite terms will
turn into a border-zone whose elements are neither univocally included in nor
excluded from the neighboring sets (<b>Figure 3</b>).</p>
<p>[7] The border zone enables a transition between opposite terms. But, beside
transition, there exist also further possibilities of mediation for every binary
opposition. Both opposite and mediative terms of Penderecki&rsquo;s categories are
listed in <b>Table 2</b> below, separately for contradictions and contrarieties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[8] As shown in the table, mediation of a contradiction can be accomplished
by means of a <i>border-zone term</i>, represented graphically by several shades
of gray in Figure 3 above. On the other
hand, mediation of a contrariety is possible owing to a <i>neutral term</i>
comprising intermediary values in Figure 4.
Furthermore, both contradiction and contrariety can be mediated by a
simultaneous occurrence of values characteristic for positive and negative terms
(<i>complex term</i>) as well as by sound masses exposing a mixture of values
evenly spread upon the whole range of a given category (<i>total term</i>).
Because Table 2 contains also abbreviated symbols of terms, it can be treated as
a handy list of explanations for later analytical samples.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>II. MORPHOLOGY&nbsp;</h4>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 5</b>. Example of a segment definition</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="mirka_examples.php?id=6&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 5 thumbnail" src="mirka_fig5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[9] On the paradigmatic axis, the categories established by binary
oppositions account for the morphology of the basic system. This is so because a
combination of their terms generates an inventory of elementary syntactical
units in Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic style. I call such units <i>segments</i>. Every
segment is thus a combination of terms chosen from all the individual
categories. Consequently, to define a segment, it is necessary (and enough) to
specify its component terms. One example of such a definition is given in <b>Figure 5</b>.</p>

<p>[10] Because there are six categories altogether, each of them modeled as a
relation of sets within a one-dimensional space, segments as syntactical units
of Penderecki&rsquo;s basic system are objects of a six-dimensional space. And because
every term of a given category is represented not by a single point, but by a
set which, moreover, is fuzzy, every segment admits an infinite number of
variants as its concrete realizations. Segments are thus to be conceived as <i>types
of texture</i>, and hence invariant, abstract entities. Their variants may
display considerable differences as to sound contents inasmuch as these
differences do not threaten constitutive terms of a given segment. One variant
of the segment just shown is the final cluster of <i>Threnody&mdash;To the Victims of
Hiroshima</i> (<b>Example 1</b>).</p>
<p>[11] Knowing all the terms of all the binary oppositions of the basic system,
one can combine them to obtain a full list of segments accessible in
Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic style. If there were only opposite terms available in
each category, the basic system could be graphically illustrated by the
&ldquo;rosette&rdquo; shown in <b>Figure 6</b>.</p>

<p>[12] Individual segments would be represented by all the hexagons to be found
within the rosette, and their total number would be 64 (=2<sup>6</sup>). The rosette
would also exhibit paradigmatic relationships between segments. Since every
opposite term of any category forms its own vertex, the higher the number of
common vertices between hexagons, the closer the relationship of segments
represented by them. In reality, however, the total number of segments actually
at Penderecki&rsquo;s disposal in his sonoristic pieces is much higher and their
paradigmatic relationships much more complicated than suggested by the rosette
due to mediative terms that occur within every category. The presence of
mediative terms means that the logical relations between terms in frameworks of
individual categories can take several, logically varied shapes: not only that
between two opposite terms, but also between one opposite and one mediative
term, as well as between two different mediatives. In each case, the
relationship between segments containing a given pair of terms is also
different.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[13] The same set of categories, which on the paradigmatic axis underlies the
morphology of the basic system, on the syntagmatic axis, determines its syntax,
that is, the temporal order of segments in the course of a musical narration. In
Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic style, this order is ruled on the level of individual
categories. In the course of a piece, the succession of terms representing a
given category is allowed to assume a shape of sequences serving as either a <i>
presentation</i> or a <i> mediation</i> of the binary opposition characteristic of a that
category. Presentation of the opposition consists in a directly contrasting
juxtaposition of its opposite terms (<b>Figure 7a</b>). In the case of mediation, one or more mediative terms is inserted between the opposite terms (<b>Figure 7b</b>). From here it follows that a prohibited sequence of terms is a return to an initial opposite term, be it positive or negative, after a mediative term or a chain of such terms has occurred (<b>Figure 7c</b>).</p>

<p>[14] Presentation of the opposition between high and low register is shown in
<b>Example 2</b>. This example brings about an
impressive amalgam of sounds produced by several quasi-musical tools as well as
by atypical techniques of playing traditional musical instruments.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> In rehearsal number 94, low register is represented originally by jarring sounds
of rattle (Rgl) and guiro, glass bar (Vtr) and sheet metal (Ltr) rubbed with
files, pieces of iron (Frro) and wood (Lgn) sawed with hand-saws, and the piano
(Pfte) whose lowest string is rubbed with a triangle rod. These non-instrumental
noises are subsequently joined by trombones, horns and tubas playing their
lowest possible notes of indefinite pitches. The high register in number 95
combines definite pitches of flutes, oboes, and vibraphone with sounds of two
triangles, flexatone, piano strings excited with wire brushes, and stringed
instruments played between bridges and tailpieces. In number 96, apart from the
unusual sound effects known already from number 94, one finds a technique of
bowing cellos and double basses on their bridges and tailpieces. Finally, in
number 97, the composer introduces an electric bell (Cmp. elttr.) and whistles
with high, sharp sounds (Ftti) whose squeaks merge with highest possible notes
of strings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[15] In the above example, segments form a simple succession. This, however,
is not always the case. In Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic pieces it happens quite often that segments overlap or impose on one another. <b>Example 3</b> shows an imposition of as many as three segments, which takes place in the central section of <i>Polymorphia</i> (38&ndash;45). Seen from the angle of the opposition between spatial mobility and immobility, this section begins with a
negative term: spatial immobility results from repetitions of an atypical
technique of playing stringed instruments that consists of striking the
fingerboard with the palm of the hand. Transition is accomplished by a gradual
introduction of more and more instruments as well as progressive differentiation
of their articulatory effects required by the composer: tapping soundboards with
fingertips, tapping the desk with the bow or the chair with the nut, <i>legno
battuto</i> between bridge and tailpiece, and highest possible notes played <i>pizzicato</i>.
This transitory passage represents a mediation of the binary opposition in
question. After the maximal impression of spatial mobility is established in
number 43, there occur lasting plies of highest possible notes in violins,
violas, and cellos (44), as well as a whole-tone cluster in contrabassi (45).
All these sound phenomena are spatially immobile and represent a new segment
imposed onto the earlier percussive effects. This new segment, in its turn,
breaks down into two: one representing high register (vn, vl, vc) and the other
located in low register (vb).&nbsp;</p>

<p>[16] Imposition of segments may result in splitting the musical narration of
a given passage into two or more parallel threads. This happens when
superimposed segments form longer chains that run along the main thread of
narration. And yet, it need not always be clear which chain forms the main, and
which one the subordinate thread. Sometimes the parallel chains are coordinate.
Some other time, the originally leading chain drives into a dead end, giving way
to the hitherto overshadowed thread of narration. Still another time, two or
three threads of either equal or different importance merge into each other,
running back into a unified stream of music. How to play out such passages of
split musical narration, is every time a matter of strategy assumed by the
composer. The two following examples demonstrate two different strategies used
by Penderecki in <i>Fluorescences</i> and in <i>Polymorphia</i>. <b>Example 4</b> from <i>Fluorescences</i> exhibits a diversity of string playing
techniques known already from the previous musical example (Example 3), which
establish spatial mobility straight from the beginning of rehearsal number 45.
At number 47, however, a new, spatially immobile segment occurs, represented by
winds playing with stops and pistons. After a break (50), this new segment is
continued by repetitions of the winds&rsquo; highest possible notes. Thus far, spatial
mobility is attributed to strings and spatial immobility to wind instruments.
But at number 55 an unexpected switch happens: winds suddenly take over the
spatially mobile segment by playing <i>staccato</i> pitches that cover the whole
sound space, while strings change to spatial immobility represented by chords
repetitions. Because these last chords are played in low register, the spatially
immobile segment at the same time skips from positive to negative term of the
opposition &ldquo;high vs. low register.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 5</b>. Penderecki, <i>Polymorphia</i> 32&ndash;37</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="mirka_examples.php?id=15&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 5 thumbnail" src="mirka_ex5_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[17] Whereas in the foregoing example the two chains of segments are kept
clearly separated, <b>Example 5</b> shows how
two threads gradually merge into one another. From the viewpoint of the
opposition &ldquo;temporal mobility vs. immobility,&rdquo; both threads represent
the latter, negative term, though realized in different ways. In violins, the
temporal immobility results from maximal density of repeated impulses <i>pizzicato</i>,
which precludes any perception of rhythmic patterns. In violas, cellos and
contrabassi the momentary chords, originally separated by more than three-second
breaks, are perceived as mutually unrelated, single impulses. Yet the temporal
intervals between them are gradually shortened, which results in a transition
from temporal immobility to mobility in this thread of musical narration. A
parallel transition happens also in violins, even if temporal intervals between
maximally dense impulses remain equal. In reality, this passage is based on a
particular compositional trick and gives interesting proof of Penderecki&rsquo;s
intuitions about processes of sound perception. It makes use of the fact that
successive sounds become more discernible as their frequency changes (thus
repeated sounds are the hardest to hear individually). Therefore, the impression
of a gradual increase of time-spans between individual <i>pizzicato</i> sounds
arises not owing to the progressive enlargement of physical time-span values,
but through gradual acceleration of glissando. As a result of their parallel
transitions, the hitherto separated threads of music fuse into one segment at
rehearsal number 37.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[18] Of course, compositional strategies apply not only to sections of a
split narration, but also to single chains of segments. Because every segment is
defined by a combination of all its terms, a change of one term suffices to
change a segment. But one can also change terms of more than one category when
moving from one segment to another. The higher the number of changing terms, the
higher and hence more general also the level of segmentation. The hierarchy of
segmentational levels constitutes a syntagmatic counterpart of the earlier
discussed problem of paradigmatic relationships of segments. Obviously, the
closer the kinship between two consecutive segments, the lower the level of
segmentation established by moving from one of them to the other. And
conversely, the lower the kinship (hence higher the contrast between them), the
higher also the level of segmentation so established. In a given piece or a
section thereof, the composer may give preference either to minimal changes
(hence operating mostly on the lowest level of segmentation) or to striking
contrasts (while operating on the highest segmentational levels). In the former
case, the result will be a smoothness and fluency of musical narration, in the
latter, narration agitated and explosive.</p>

<p>[21] Still another area of compositional
strategies concerns relations between categories. Basically, of course,
individual categories are mutually independent, but the composer may create
artificial dependences between them by linking some of their terms into more or
less permanent configurations. One example of such a configuration is to be
found in the section of <i>Fluorescences</i> played earlier, where high register
is each time combined with soft dynamics and low register with loud dynamics (Example
2).</p>

<p>[20] Finally, a compositional strategy may also aim to create dependences
between categories on the one hand and individual levels of segmentation on the
other. This happens when the composer makes some categories act mostly on lower
and others mostly on higher hierarchical levels. In such cases, one can speak of
a hierarchy of categories assumed for a given piece or a section thereof, hence
also of higher and lower level categories. While categories of lower levels
account for local nuances of a piece, higher-level categories are responsible
for its overall formal layout as comprehended by a listener. For example, in <i>Fluorescences</i>
a strong impression of a tripartite ABA form arises owing to the category
&ldquo;spatial mobility vs. immobility&rdquo; which changes only twice in the
course of the piece. An individual listener may understand this form quite
otherwise, however, if the listener concentrates on another category or shifts
attention between different categories as the piece unfolds. The analytical
diagrams of this and other Penderecki&rsquo;s pieces, included in my book (Mirka
1997), can thus be seen as their particular maps, summing up all the possible
routes the listener can take across the music.</p>

<p>[21] My most immediate aim was to
explain how Penderecki had dealt with texture and, consequently, how a music
theorist should deal with the texture of Penderecki&rsquo;s sonoristic pieces. A
further question is whether this explanation tells us something valuable about
how to deal with texture in general. Certainly, texture and timbre are the two
aspects of music in which systematic analytical approach is still missing.
Perhaps the system of Penderecki, elaborated as his method of composition&mdash;both
the basic system just discussed and the timbre system left aside from this
discussion&mdash;may give some new impulses to methods of musical analysis.</p>
