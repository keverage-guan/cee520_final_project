broaden their focus beyond the Austro-German repertoire. The notion of &#8220;common

<h3 align="center"> 
I.</h3>
<p>[1] As Clausewitz famously declared, war is a continuation of politics by other 
means.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> By now it is hardly news that music analysis, in almost all forms 
inherited from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, is a continuation 
of German Romantic ideology by other means. Yet saying so (and it has been said 
for over a quarter-century now) has changed remarkably little in the day-to-day 
life of North American music theorists. In particular, it has not changed the 
pre-twentieth-century repertoires that we study and teach. German Romantic 
hegemony has been challenged in many ways&#8212;most loudly perhaps by Richard 
Taruskin<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>&#8212;but theorists have hardly begun to do so using other repertoires, 
contemporary to its ascendancy, that might offer alternatives to it. It seems 
foolish to eschew organicist methods of analysis for music conceived according 
to organicist premises,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> but it is equally foolish to apply only organicist 
methods to music differently conceived. Without seeking to topple German 
Romanticism within its own domain, we should explore other domains and try to 
view them in other ways. Only, since German Romanticism saw its domain as 
universal, to relativize it in this way&#8212;to deny its universalizing claims&#8212;is 
necessarily to dethrone it. We can continue to draw our Schenker graphs and tell 
our Carpenter narratives without expecting the world to submit to Schenkerian or 
Schoenbergian standards of measurement.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Similarly, we can continue to cherish 
the Austro-German repertoire from Bach to Webern without granting it the 
aesthetic exclusivity that its apologists sought or, in many cases, assumed.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2] For each dominant culture, there are multiple countercultures. The 
counterculture that I choose to cultivate is nineteenth-century Italian opera.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> In this essay, intended as a prolegomenon to a larger study, I argue for the 
historical and theoretical importance of this repertoire within the larger 
corpus of nineteenth-century music. This importance lies partly in historical 
priority: some innovations that have widely been ascribed to German composers 
can more plausibly be traced to Italy. At a minimum, Italian composers 
discovered them independently and popularized them earlier than composers in 
other parts of Europe.</p>
<h3 align="center">II.</h3>
<p>[3] It has been thirty years since Robert Bailey introduced five concepts for 
the analysis of Wagner&#8217;s operas: associative tonality; expressive tonality; 
directional tonality; tonal pairing; and the double-tonic complex.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> The 
double-tonic complex remains controversial, but Bailey&#8217;s other ideas have been 
widely accepted, at least in North American scholarship. Directional tonality 
and tonal pairing have proven especially important to the analysis of 
Austro-German music from Wagner through Wolf, Mahler, and early Schoenberg, 
offering an alternative to more traditional approaches, chiefly 
Schenker-inspired, that seemed to work less well for the post-Wagnerian 
repertoire. The state of this art <i>circa</i> 1990 can be reviewed in the well-known 
volume <i>The Second Practice of Nineteenth-Century Tonality</i>, a Bailey <i>Festschrift</i> 
in all but name.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>[4] Bailey&#8217;s concepts have also been applied to music before Wagner. Harald 
Krebs has been especially active here, publishing several articles on 
directional tonality and tonal pairing in the music of Schubert and Chopin.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>  
William Kinderman and Kevin Korsyn have also discussed Chopin&#8217;s two-key pieces 
from a more or less Bailey-influenced point of view.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Peter Kaminsky has 
explored the subject of tonal pairing and directional tonality in Schumann&#8217;s 
early piano cycles, albeit without direct reference to Bailey&#8217;s ideas.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>[5] Virtually all of this attention has been focused on music by Austro-German 
composers, the sole exception being Chopin&#8212;a composer who, as most theorists 
know, was adopted as an honorary German by Heinrich Schenker, much as Berlioz 
was adopted (for different reasons!) by adherents of the New German School.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
William Kinderman, in his introduction to <i>The Second Practice</i>, acknowledges the 
Austro-German focus of that volume, while expressing the hope that scholars will 
apply its approach to &#8220;French, Russian, and other musical repertoires of the 
nineteenth century.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[6] David Kopp&#8217;s recent book, <i>Chromatic Transformations in Nineteenth-Century 
Music</i>, continues the Austro-German bias. Kopp&#8217;s book is largely about chromatic 
third-relations, especially modally matched transformations involving one common 
tone&#8212;for example, a move from a major triad to its major mediant (III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">) or 
lowered submediant (<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI).<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> There is nothing peculiarly Germanic about 
chromatic third-relations, but when it comes time for analytical illustration 
Kopp rounds up the usual suspects: Schubert, Chopin, and Wolf. He does include 
pieces by Liszt and Dvorak, two composers closely identified with German styles, 
and a short excerpt by Smetana. There is even a snippet of Chausson.</p>
<p>[7] Kopp&#8217;s omission of Italian music is both noteworthy and symptomatic: 
noteworthy, because in chromatic third-relations it was Rossini who set the 
pattern for the rest of Europe to follow; symptomatic, because the 
marginalization of nineteenth-century Italian opera has long been a defining 
feature of North American music theory. I can only sketch the relevant history 
here. Italian opera was the Other against which German Romantic musical culture 
defined itself, as can be seen in the writings of critics from Schumann to 
Wagner, Hanslick, and Schenker.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Even before the arrival in America of 
Schoenberg, Hindemith, and the Schenker circle, those American musicians 
involved in teaching and writing about music theory tended to be Germanic in 
their musical sympathies, and some (including Percy Goetschius) studied in 
Germany. But other, non-Germanic viewpoints continued to flourish&#8212;as evidenced, 
for example, by those American composers who flocked to Nadia Boulanger. The 
musico-intellectual climate changed gradually after the arrival of Austro-German 
&eacute;migr&eacute;s, who impressed their Germanocentrism on American composers and, still 
more profoundly, on American theorists.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> That theory was even more deeply 
affected than composition surely owed to the fact that speculative theory was 
overwhelmingly a German field after 1850; to think theoretically was, almost by 
definition, to think Germanically. By the 1950s American theory was dominated by 
an Austro-German (often specifically Viennese) aesthetic, which only increased 
as professional theorists progressively displaced composers in the theory 
classroom. While American opera fans were thrilling to Maria Callas and the <i>bel 
canto</i> revival, elite opinion held that the only acceptable Italian operas were
<i>Otello</i> (Verdi&#8217;s, not Rossini&#8217;s), <i>Falstaff</i>, and anything by Mozart. The only 
nineteenth-century vocal pieces encountered in the typical theory classroom 
were, and are, <i>Lieder</i>.</p>
<p>[8] What, for an earlier generation, was principled Germanocentrism has 
continued to the present day through a combination of inertia, indoctrination, 
and prejudice. While twentieth-century popular music has been declared ripe for 
theoretical attention, American theorists have largely cleaved to the 
&#8220;classical&#8221; repertoires they learned in their youth and the prejudices they 
imbibed from their teachers. I speak, of course, partly from personal 
experience.</p>
<p>[9] As I suggested earlier, many of the innovative practices addressed by 
Bailey, Kopp, and others can be found in early-nineteenth-century Italian opera, 
which may represent their historical source. That Schubert was affected by the 
Viennese mania for Rossini; that Chopin&#8217;s melody shows the imprint of Rossini 
and Bellini; that Wagner admired Bellini&#8217;s melodies and his dramatic sense&#8212;all 
of these things are well known. The effects of Rossini&#8217;s music on Schubert&#8217;s 
harmonic practice are only beginning to be described,<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> while Italian influence 
on Schumann seems to have gone unrecognized. Myths created by Wagner himself 
have obscured recognition of what he learned from his Italian predecessors.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>III.</b></p>
<p>[10] The same decades that saw the efflorescence of North American scholarship 
on Wagner and his successors saw an unprecedented upsurge of analytical 
attention to the music of Verdi. An early indication of both trends was the 1984 
Verdi&#8211;Wagner conference at Cornell University (which I did not attend) and the 
book, <i>Analyzing Opera</i>, that grew out of it.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> The editors of that volume, 
Carolyn Abbate and Roger Parker, juxtaposed Verdi essays and Wagner essays as 
carefully as a chief of protocol seating guests at a state dinner, but they 
failed to hide the lack of scholarly intercourse between Verdians and 
Wagnerians. Like the Italian and German divisions of the Metropolitan Opera in 
its early decades, the two groups of scholars merely occupied the same building. 
They may have chatted cordially, but they didn&#8217;t cite each others&#8217; work&#8212;this 
despite the shared heritage of their heroes in the music of Spontini, Rossini, 
Bellini, Hal&eacute;vy, Meyerbeer, <i>et al</i>. The situation was different in Europe, where 
a similar conference had been held in 1969 with far greater emphasis on the

<p>[11] The new Verdi scholarship has been extremely impressive, yet this 
literature seems to be unknown to all but a few American music theorists.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup>  
Although much of this work has been carried out by Europeans (among them 
Pierluigi Petrobelli, Friedrich Lippmann, and Gilles de Van), many leading Verdi 
analysts have been North Americans; yet hardly any have held professional 
positions in music theory.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Verdi analysts to emerge in the 1970s included 
Martin Chusid, David Lawton, and Robert Moreen. The &#8216;80s and &#8216;90s produced 
Harold Powers, James Hepokoski, Scott Balthazar, Steven Huebner, and Roger 
Parker (although Parker has become more of an anti-analyst). Among the younger 
generation there is Andreas Giger, who specializes in Verdi&#8217;s French operas. 
Every one of these figures has emerged from the disciplines of historical 
musicology or, in Powers&#8217; case, ethnomusicology. To ask why would be to confront 
some of the most deeply entrenched biases of American music theory.</p>
<p>[12] Let us turn instead to some of the positive ideas that have emerged from 
Verdi scholarship. A great deal of attention has been paid, understandably, to 
matters of musical form, since formal principles in this repertoire differ 
significantly from those familiar to theorists from the study of Viennese 
instrumental music ca. 1775&#8211;1815.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> More important, for my purposes, has been 
an idea that was proposed, apparently independently, by Pierluigi Petrobelli and 
Martin Chusid in the early 1970s. Petrobelli argued that Azucena&#8217;s music in 
<i>Il trovatore</i> centers around a single melodic pitch, B4, which is alternately 
harmonized by the keys of E minor and G major.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> At about the same time, Chusid 
demonstrated the centrality of the pitch C4 to the music sung by two baritone 
characters in <i>Rigoletto</i>, Monterone and Rigoletto himself.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> In effect, 
Petrobelli and Chusid argued that, at least for these characters, the center of 
musical gravity lay not in the orchestral bass but in the vocal line. Instead of 
emanating upward from a fundamental, as in the tonal theories of Rameau and 
Schenker, musical coherence emanates downward from a focal melodic pitch. 
Petrobelli dubbed such a focal pitch a <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> (&#8220;sonority&#8221;).</p>
<p>[13] The concept of <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> was adopted by other scholars, including Harold 
Powers and David Rosen.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Both promoted the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> as a distinctively Italian 
organizing principle, arguing (as I shall argue) that Verdi&#8217;s music follows 
principles different from those that underlie most Austro-German music. In 
addition to building on Chusid&#8217;s work on &#8220;baritone C,&#8221; Powers offered an 
analysis of the love duet from Verdi&#8217;s <i>Otello</i>, also based on the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i>. Here, 
it seemed, was a new way of demonstrating musical coherence in non-monotonal 
music. But the implications of the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> concept are more radical than this. 
As I have already noted, the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> de-privileges the bass of a musical 
texture, using melodic pitches (not tonics) as the principal agent of coherence. 
It thus represents a departure from all bass-oriented theories of tonality. One 
task of opera analysis in the coming decades will be to evaluate the 
applicability and scope of the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> concept.</p>
<p>[14] Unlike the early Wagner analyst Alfred Lorenz, Verdi scholars have rarely 
invoked Hugo Riemann. But the Riemann revival of recent years reminds us that 
Riemann, too, argued against privileging the bass; he railed ceaselessly against 
what he called &#8220;thoroughbass&#8221; theories, among which he included Rameau&#8217;s 
fundamental bass and Gottfried Weber&#8217;s Roman numerals. Riemann&#8217;s function theory 
has no fixed points of reference except the tonic and its two dominants; his 
theory of <i>Schritte</i> and <i>Wechseln</i> lacks even these. A theory of nineteenth-century 
music based on common-tone relations&#8212;Kopp&#8217;s term &#8220;common-tone tonality&#8221; 
describes it nicely&#8212;has much in common with Riemannian and especially 
neo-Riemannian theories. It also has obvious points of contact with theories of 
twentieth-century &#8220;centric&#8221; music. Igor Stravinsky, for example, pointed to the 
note A as the &#8220;axis of sound&#8221; in his <i>S&eacute;r&eacute;nade en la</i> (1925), regardless of 
whether A is harmonized by chords of F major, A minor, or (later) A major. In 
other words, Stravinsky&#8217;s <i>la</i> is a <i>sonorit&agrave;</i>.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>
<p>[15] We are left with multiple theoretical traditions, German and non-German, 
with no clear relation to each other. In what follows, I begin to bring some of 
these traditions together for the purpose of understanding Italian operatic 
music between 1810 and 1860. I proceed more or less chronologically, beginning 
with Rossini and ending with a famous excerpt from Verdi&#8217;s <i>Il trovatore</i>. As we 
shall see, Rossini embeds chromatic mediants and tonal pairing within a mostly 
traditional tonal framework. Composers from Bellini onward increasingly disrupt 
this framework, moving into realms beyond monotonality. To explain these later 
practices (which begin no later than 1825), we will need to employ theoretical 
approaches not typically applied to music from the first half of the nineteenth 
century.</p>

<p>[16] The frequent use of chromatic mediants is a Rossinian fingerprint from the 
earliest years of his career. What made the cabaletta &#8220;Di tanti palpiti&#8221; from 
<i>Tancredi </i>(1813) wildly popular for half a century was only partly its jaunty 
melody; it was also the quietly thrilling move from a C-major chord 
(representing a half cadence in F major) to a new phrase in A-flat major, with 
nothing to foreshadow it save a <i>crescendo</i> on scale-degree <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>, which becomes the 
leading tone to A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">. (See <b>Example 1</b>.) The characteristically Rossinian move 
of a major third downward, from one major triad to another, was far from unknown 
in eighteenth-century music, where it usually involved a direct move from III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, 
approached as V of the relative minor, to a major tonic. In an article first 
published in 1957, Jan LaRue called this phenomenon &#8220;bifocal tonality,&#8221; which he 
described as a combination of a major key with its relative (not parallel) 
minor.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
The presence of III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I progressions in the music of J. S. Bach, Haydn, 
Mozart, and Beethoven has been widely discussed; in his <i>Harmonielehre</i> (1906), 
Schenker describes III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I as a means of tonicization, an alternative to V&#8211;I.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup>  
Rossini&#8217;s move in <i>Tancredi </i>is more unconventional, because it involves not a 
return to the tonic but a leap from an active dominant into a distant key.</p>
			<p>[17] Rossini&#8217;s progression can easily be described using any of the available 
neo-Riemannian theories. In the best-known version, based on the work of David 
Lewin and others, Rossini&#8217;s move from a C-major to an A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">-major triad 
represents the double transformation PL; the change of key, F major to A-flat 
major (a more abstract relation), represents PR. Using Kopp&#8217;s positional 
terms&#8212;not his transformations&#8212;Rossini moves from V to UFM (the Upper Flat 
Mediant) of his main tonic, F major; in relation to A-flat major, the move is 
from USM (the Upper Sharp Mediant) to I. In terms of Daniel Harrison&#8217;s theory, 
there is a dominant discharge from G to A<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> (leading tone to tonic) and a 
subdominant discharge from E (representing F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, the flatted sixth degree) to 
E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> Readers who are so inclined may translate my remaining analyses into 
the desired dialect of neo-Riemannian.</p>
		
<p>[18] Although Rossini&#8217;s music is not as stereotyped as some believe, his most 
effective ideas often turned into predictable mannerisms. In 1818, less than two 
years after Rossini&#8217;s music was first performed in Vienna, a critic there wrote: 
&#8220;[Rossini] generally precedes the <i>stretta</i> of the first finale with a very slow 
movement in a dark but theatrically effective A-flat major, whereupon the noisy 
<i>stretta</i> follows in a bright C major.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> The critic may have been describing the 
first-act finale of <i>Il barbiere di Siviglia</i> (1816), which follows precisely this 
pattern. He might have added that if a Rossini finale ends in C major, it also 
begins there; a slow movement in A-flat major would thus be heard as <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI in 
relation to the finale&#8217;s overall tonic. In 1816, Rossini&#8212;a classicist in many 
respects&#8212;still believed in unity of key over the course of an operatic number, 
whether that number was an <i>introduzione</i>, a double aria, a four-movement duet, or 
a multi-movement finale. The slow movement of any of these tends to be set by 
Rossini in a chromatic mediant key, either III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">III, or <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI. (Rossini did not 
favor VI<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> for this purpose.)</p>
<p>[19] The first-act finale of <i>Semiramide</i> (1823) is also in C major, but its slow movement&#8212;known, in a finale, as the <i>pezzo concertato</i>&#8212;goes a step further than usual. Rossini begins this <i>concertato</i> in A-flat minor, although he uses a key signature of only four flats; he resolves this extremely distant key to the usual A-flat major midway through the movement. And yes, the final movement is a &#8220;noisy <i>stretta</i> <nobr>. . .</nobr> in a bright C major.&#8221;</p>

<p>[20] Especially (but not only) in comic operas, Rossini found sudden shifts to 
chromatic mediants useful to depict outbursts of surprise, frustration, or rage 
on the parts of his characters. The flat chromatic mediants, <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">III and <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI, are 
heavily favored for this purpose. In <i>Barbiere</i> a surprising number of these 
chromatic outbursts involve the triad of E-flat major, acting either as <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">III in 
C major, as <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI in G major, or in one case as <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">II in D major (in Basilio&#8217;s aria 
&#8220;La calunnia&#8221;). The focus on E-flat major is especially striking in Act 1, in 
which all numbers but one are in sharp or neutral (&#8220;white-note&#8221;) keys. The 
exception is the act&#8217;s penultimate number, Bartolo&#8217;s aria &#8220;A un dottor della mia 
sorte,&#8221; which is in E-flat major. Once the finale begins, Bartolo&#8217;s key is 
recontextualized as <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">III of C major. The only other number in Act 1 with a key 
signature of more than two sharps or flats is Rosina&#8217;s cavatina &#8220;Una voce poco 
fa,&#8221; which is in E major&#8212;<nobr>VI<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"></nobr> of the act-opening G major, III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> of the finale&#8217;s C major.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p>

<p>[21] In <i>Barbiere</i>, the chromatic outbursts that I have described generally 
explain themselves retrospectively; their entrances are disruptive, but their 
exits are well-mannered. Even the noisiest <img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI, for example, usually resolves to V (although there is a complete major-third cycle I&#8211;<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">VI&#8211;III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I in Figaro&#8217;s &#8220;Largo al factotum&#8221;). Such conventional contextualizations of chromatic mediants 
occur less consistently where the slow movement of a multi-movement number is 
concerned. Usually a modulating transition will lead fairly smoothly into the 
slow movement, but the movement itself is tonally closed, ending with repeated 
PACs in its assigned key. The following <i>tempo di mezzo</i> (a transitional movement) 
may begin directly with the governing tonic, so that the underlying chromatic 
third-relation is heard directly; or the <i>tempo di mezzo</i> may prolong the home 
dominant, so that the slow movement&#8217;s chromatic mediant is heard to progress to 
V; or the t<i>empo di mezzo </i>may begin in some foreign key and work its way back to 
the tonic. When there is direct motion from the chromatic mediant to the tonic, 
the effect may be compared to that in some of Haydn&#8217;s late instrumental works in 
which a slow movement in some distant, flat-side key is followed by a minuet or 
finale in the tonic.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup></p>

<p>[22] Some of Rossini&#8217;s most adventurous harmonic writing is found in his last 
opera, <i>Guillaume Tell </i>(1829). A significant portion of <i>Tell</i>&#8212;the famous Overture, 
the five-movement Introduction, the four-movement finale to Act 1, and much of 
Act 3&#8212;is dominated by the pairing of two tonics, E and G.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> G appears almost 
exclusively as G major; E vacillates between its minor and major modes. (C major 
appears often as an intermediary key.) In effect, E minor is surrounded by its 
relative and parallel major keys&#8212;recalling, perhaps, Gottfried Weber&#8217;s 
well-known chart of key relations (<b>Example 2</b>), in which each minor key is 
surrounded in precisely this fashion on the chart&#8217;s horizontal axis.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> We know 
that Robert Schumann was familiar with Weber&#8217;s chart; <sup>
<a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" style="text-decoration: none">(36)</a></sup> whether Rossini knew 
it is uncertain.</p>
			<p>[23] <i>Tell</i> is Rossini&#8217;s most Romantic opera not only aesthetically but 
compositionally. Employing both relative and parallel keys is nothing new, but 
Rossini employs them in a decidedly post-classical way. By &#8220;post-classical&#8221; I 
refer primarily to three phenomena: (1) the frequent use of direct modulation by 
common tone, foregoing dominant preparation of the new key; (2) use of the 
relative major outside the I&#8211;III&#8211;V bass arpeggiation described by Schenker as 
normative for the minor mode; (3) in major, using III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I progressions that are 
not hierarchically subordinate to some larger fifth-relation.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup></p>

<p>[24] In <i>Tell</i>, no fewer than three numbers&#8212;the finales of Acts 2, 3, and 
4&#8212;violate Rossini&#8217;s usual practice of beginning and ending a number (excluding 
any introductory recitative) in the same key, perhaps with a change from minor 
to parallel major.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> However, all numbers that feature the E&#8211;G pairing are 
tonally closed; that is, they begin and end with the same tonic. The Overture, 
in four short movements, traces the key scheme e/E&#8211;e&#8211;G&#8211;E. Despite its 
nontraditional form, the Overture&#8217;s tonal arc is sufficiently traditional to be 
represented in a Schenkerian graph, which also reveals some (though not all) of 
the music&#8217;s unusual features. <b>Example 3</b> offers such a graph. It shows that G 
major is repeatedly reached from V of e/E, a major triad in either mode. The 
famous <i>stretta</i> (Allegro vivace, E major, 2/4) is announced by a trumpet call on 
B4, B being the one tone common to the tonic triads of all three keys. Within 
the <i>stretta</i>, E major alternates several times with its relative minor, c<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">. Moves

<p>[25] <b>Example 4</b> gives most of the Overture&#8217;s first movement in a piano reduction. 
The head-motive of the main theme, in E major, is harmonized differently on each 
of its four appearances (measures 17, 21, 28, and 32). The last two of these harmonizations include the pitch-class E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">/F, which was introduced in a highly 
marked way in measures 12&#8211;13, where it was dramatized by the unusual leap of a 
diminished fifth&#8212;unusual, that is, in the progression from a Neapolitan sixth to 
a dominant. The F-major chord returns at the upbeat to measure 34, now not as 
Neapolitan but as subdominant of a C major that returns immediately to E major. 
In the ensuing cadential progression, a conventional trill on scale-degree <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> 
(F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">4) is accompanied by some rather unconventional harmonies: in addition to V 
of E, we hear dominant seventh chords on G<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> and D, in each of which the trilled

the Introduction (the opening number of Act 1). The Introduction&#8217;s five 
movements trace the key scheme G&#8211;C&#8211;e&#8211;E&#8211;G, so the overall modulation in our 
example is from C major to E minor. The decisive move is the first, from C major 
to E major, which is carried out by first isolating the common tone E4 in the 
solo horn (the stage directions read &#8220;Ici l&#8217;on entend le ranz des vaches [here 
one hears the <i>ranz des vaches</i>]&#8221;). Motion to the implied G-major harmony is from 
V of E, another III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I progression in a major key; the common tone B (heard in 
two registers) forms the link. As my sketch shows, G major is embedded within 
the transition in a rather classical way, forming part of a dominant 
prolongation in E minor. G returns to V of E through a harmonic sequence and a 
descending fourth-progression in the upper voice, the latter outlining the 
interval from root to fifth of the V harmony. Repeated soundings of B3 and B4 
lead to the third movement, an Allegro vivace in E minor. A similar but shorter 
transition links movements 4 and 5, again emphasizing B4 as common tone between 
the tonic triads of E major and G major.</p>

<p>[27] To summarize: Rossini was an early adopter of chromatic mediants, which he 
used chiefly for purposes of dramatic contrast. It is in this area that he most 
clearly influenced Austro-German composers, beginning with the first Viennese 
performances of his operas in 1816.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> Rossini was more conservative about 
directional tonality and tonal pairing, <i>Guillaume Tell</i> being a conspicuous 
exception. His frequent use of common-tone modulation, in which the common tone 
is often isolated or otherwise highlighted, adumbrates the use of the <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> 
as a unifying device. His chromaticism, which I have only touched upon here, was 
sufficiently advanced for F&eacute;tis to count him among the pioneers of the <i>genre omnitonique</i>. Tonal closure within an operatic number was a binding requirement 
for the young Rossini and remained the norm thereafter. Nevertheless, the 
enormous size of some numbers, their division into several movements, and the 
freedom of modulation within movements made the move away from monotonality 
relatively easy, for later composers if not for Rossini himself.</p>
<h3 align="center">V.</h3>
<p>[28] Donizetti&#8217;s operatic career began in 1818, Bellini&#8217;s in 1825. I am 
unfamiliar with most of Donizetti&#8217;s early operas, but there are numbers in 
<i>La zingara</i> (1822) that begin and end in different keys.<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> Interestingly, this 
opera was a favorite of Bellini&#8217;s in his student years. While both composers 
felt free to begin and end a number in different keys, Bellini used tonal 
pairing&#8212;which involves repeated motion between two tonics&#8212;remarkably early and 
in an especially prominent way. He also uses fixed melodic pitches in ways that 
seem to have little precedent in Rossini.</p>
<p>[29] In Bellini&#8217;s first opera, <i>Adelson e Salvini</i> (1825), the duet of Salvini and 
Bonifacio begins in F minor and ends in C major. The orchestral prelude begins 
with a unison C repeated many times, and C acts as a dominant pedal almost 
continuously throughout the prelude. The duet&#8217;s initial F-minor strain ends with 
an emphatic half cadence, whereupon the unison C returns (again repeated many 
times) and leads to A-flat major in a III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I progression. After this, a 
modulatory transition leads to another half cadence in F minor (the tonic 
appears only in passing), to be followed once again by the repeated unison C and 
the A-flat-major strain. A lengthy dominant pedal of C minor then leads to the 
C-major cabaletta. It could easily be argued that the duet is forged into a 
musical unit by the note C, which acts successively as dominant of F minor, 
third of A-flat major, and tonic of C major. This C does not quite fit 
Petrobelli&#8217;s definition of a <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> because it is emphasized primarily in the 
orchestra, not in the vocal lines.</p>
<p>[30] In <i>The Operas of Verdi</i>, Julian Budden cites Gualtiero&#8217;s cavatina, or 
entrance aria, in <i>Il pirata</i> (1827) as an early example of a number that begins 
and ends in different keys.<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> Budden seems to be referring principally to the 
first movement, or <i>cantabile</i>, of Gualtiero&#8217;s aria, but the path of directional 
tonality that defines the cantabile&#8212;G minor to B-flat major&#8212;also defines the 
aria as a whole. It also matches the tonal trajectory of Act 1 in the opera&#8217;s 
first printed score, a vocal score published in 1828.<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> 
The pairing of G 
(mostly minor) and B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> (mostly major) also pervades Gualtiero&#8217;s
<i>scena</i> 
(recitative), which is not counted as part of the aria proper.</p>
<p>[31] <b>Example 6</b> gives a simple diagram for the aria as a whole; <b>Example 7</b> is an 
excerpt. The <i>scena</i> vacillates between B-flat major and G minor. The aria&#8217;s 
opening ritornello begins solidly in G minor. It modulates to D minor just as 
the tenor enters, singing the final word of his <i>scena</i>, &#8220;ascolta&#8221; (&#8220;listen&#8221;).<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> 
And listen we do, for the D-minor cadence is followed immediately by a 
<i>fortissimo</i> dominant seventh of B-flat major, which is followed in turn (after a 
brief silence) by a quiet PAC in G minor. Providing dominant preparation for one 
key but delivering its relative becomes an Italian trademark for decades to 
come.<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup></p>

<p>[32] The main body of Gualtiero&#8217;s cantabile repeats the ritornello as far as the 
internal cadence in D minor. After the fermata, we hear a completely new strain 
in B-flat major, entirely over a tonic pedal; with this the first strophe will 
end. After a modulating middle section, the opening strophe is heard a second 
time. The following <i>tempo di mezzo</i> returns to the aria&#8217;s original tonic, G, but 
this time it is G major. After a spell in related sharp keys (E minor and B 
minor), Bellini modulates by way of G minor back to B-flat major for the 
cabaletta. The latter is firmly in B-flat major, with internal cadences in G 
minor.</p>
<p>[33] The aria&#8217;s tonal plot could hardly be clearer. Two years before Rossini&#8217;s 
<i>Guillaume Tell</i>, Bellini pairs two tonics, G and B<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, within a trio of keys in 
which G minor is flanked by its relative and parallel majors. Unlike Rossini, 
Bellini allows free motion between his tonics, with no obligation of ending 
where he began, either within a single movement or over the course of a 
multi-movement aria.</p>
<p>[34] Bellini&#8217;s three tonic triads share a single pitch class, D. Not 
surprisingly, D4 is the focal pitch in Gualtiero&#8217;s vocal line. D4 is more than a 
Schenkerian <i>Kopfton</i> (although it is that, too); it is more like a reciting tone. 
Furthermore, Bellini repeats an unordered group of three pitches, F4&#8211;E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">4&#8211;D4, 
within both the G-minor and the B-flat-major portions of the aria. In example 
7 
I have bracketed this three-note cell on many of its appearances. Toward the end 
of the <i>scena</i> (measures 41&#8211;45), the cell&#8217;s F is pointedly cross-related to the 
dominant&#8217;s F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">. Here F is an appoggiatura to an upper-neighbor E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, as 
unstable a tone as can be imagined within a largely diatonic passage. During the 
orchestral ritornello, the oboe repeats the three-note cell obsessively&#8212;much as 
Gualtiero, the pirate of the opera&#8217;s title, has dwelt on the mental image of his 
beloved Imogene during his years at sea. F remains an upper neighbor to an upper 
neighbor. But when it comes time actually to represent Imogene&#8217;s image&#8212;to fix it 
within his mind&#8212;Gualtiero fixes the three-note cell within a B-flat-major 
harmony, so that F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/natural.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> becomes consonant. The psychological aptness of the 
musical transformation is clear.</p>

<p>[35] The cantabile is in the usual two-strophe form. In its brief coda, the 
three-note cell is sung slowly over a tonic pedal in B-flat (<b>Example 8</b>), 
imprinting it still more firmly. The cell disappears from the <i>tempo di mezzo</i> but 
is heard repeatedly at the beginning of the cabaletta (<b>Example 9</b>)&#8212;first 
ascending, consonant, and over a major triad, as when Gualtiero conjured 
Imogene&#8217;s image in the cantabile; then descending, dissonant, and over a minor 
triad, as in the earlier G-minor music. Elementary Schenkerian analysis of the 
opening phrase reveals the presence of the cell just beneath the musical surface 
(<b>Example 10</b>), an instance of so-called hidden repetition. Curiously, this 
cabaletta is a transposed version of the cabaletta from the Salvini/Bonifacio 
duet in <i>Adelson e Salvini</i>. Recycling pieces from little-known or failed operas 
was common practice for Rossini and Bellini, so its use here is not surprising. 
What is impressive is that Bellini realized just how well his old wine suits its 
new bottle.</p>

<p>[36] Bellini&#8217;s recurring use of a three-note scale fragment common to two keys 
suggests that Petrobelli&#8217;s <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> concept may be unnecessarily restrictive in 
its focus on a single pitch. If Gualtiero has a single <i>sonorit&agrave;</i>, it is surely 
D4. But recognizing the three-note cell as a unifying entity seems a better 
analytical strategy for this aria.</p>
<p>[37] Directional tonality and tonal pairing remain exceptional in <i>Il pirata</i> and 
in Bellini&#8217;s next opera, <i>La straniera</i> (1829). When they do occur, therefore, 
they are especially striking. The <i>rond&ograve;-finale</i> (concluding aria) of 
<i>La straniera</i> 
includes a cantabile in B-flat major, a widely modulating <i>tempo di mezzo</i>, and a cabeletta that moves from a B-flat-minor beginning to a D-flat-major ending; the 
contrasting interlude between the cabaletta&#8217;s two strophes provides dominant 
preparation for B-flat minor, as did the end of the <i>tempo di mezzo</i>. One notes a 
similarity between the cabaletta&#8217;s key scheme and that of Chopin&#8217;s Scherzo op. 
31 (1837); although Chopin surely knew <i>La straniera</i>, the similarity may be 
coincidental. Owing to the presence of the B-flat-major cantabile, it is 
difficult and probably nonsensical to hear the cabaletta&#8217;s opening B-flat minor 
merely as VI of D<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">, as Schenker argued should be done in Chopin&#8217;s op. 31.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup>  
Unlike Gualtiero&#8217;s cavatina from <i>Il pirata</i>, there is no obvious <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> or 
recurring pitch-cell in Alaide&#8217;s <i>rond&ograve;</i>.</p>
<h3 align="center">VI.</h3>
<p>[38] In Italian operas of the 1830s, tonal unity within an operatic number is at 
best a weak stylistic expectation, violated as often as it is fulfilled. By 1850 
a tonally unified number sounds faintly archaic. The forms inherited from 
Rossini become a principal means of orientation for listeners, without stable 
tonal props to support them. Cantabiles and cabalettas often remain tonally 
closed, but larger numbers (of which these are components) do not.</p>
<p>[39] It is impossible to generalize about tonal architecture in Verdi&#8217;s operas. 
Some operas seem more tightly constructed than others, but the means on which 
Verdi relies for tonal association and contrast are not consistent from one 
opera to the next.<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup> Not surprisingly, operas that were never substantially 
revised once completed, such as <i>Rigoletto</i> and <i>Un ballo in maschera</i>, tend to have 
clearer structures than those, such as <i>Don Carlos</i>, that went through multiple 
versions. Some operas, such as <i>Macbeth</i> (1847, rev. 1865) and <i>Simon Boccanegra</i> 
(1857, rev. 1881), rely on major-third cycles and their associated hexatonic 
systems for their principal keys, each of which may have clear dramatic 
associations.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup> 
Each Verdi opera inhabits its own world and must be evaluated 
independently.</p>
<p>[40] <i>Il trovatore</i> has attracted more analytical comment than any middle-period 
Verdi opera except, perhaps, <i>Rigoletto</i>. The most obvious thread running through 
the opera, especially for listeners with absolute pitch, is the opposition 
between mildly sharp-side or neutral keys (C major, A minor, E minor, and G 
major) and keys with four or more flats, especially the trio of keys F 
minor&#8211;A-flat major&#8211;A-flat minor (I list them in an order opposite to Weber&#8217;s so 
that the most extreme key appears last). Several commentators have convincingly 
associated the former set of keys with the gypsy Azucena and the gypsies in 
general; the latter, flatter set is associated with the high-born Leonora.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup>  
Aurally, the gypsies inhabit a realm of light, Leonora one of darkness.</p>
<p>[41] The opening number of Act 2 was entitled <i>Coro di Zingari e canzone 
</i>(&#8220;Chorus 
of Gypsies and song&#8221;) by Verdi.<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> It is popularly known as the &#8220;Anvil Chorus,&#8221; 
although Azucena&#8217;s <i>canzone</i> &#8220;Stride la vampa&#8221; is often erroneously regarded as a 
separate number. By &#8220;Anvil Chorus&#8221; I designate the entire number as Verdi 
conceived it. In this number we again encounter the kinds of fixed-pitch 
references that were such a striking feature of the Bellini aria analyzed 
earlier. These references are so little dependent on their harmonization that 
they recall pre-tonal settings of <i>cantus firmi</i>&#8212;for example, Monteverdi&#8217;s 
settings of psalm tones in his 1610 Vespers.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup></p>
<p>[42] I will claim that Verdi&#8217;s &#8220;Anvil Chorus&#8221; is &#8220;in&#8221; E in much the same sense 
that Stravinsky&#8217;s <i>S&eacute;r&eacute;nade en la</i> is &#8220;in&#8221; A. The piece begins in E minor and ends 
in C major, with E prominently featured at both beginning and end. E gradually 
emerges as a <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> for the chorus, acting as a reciting tone first over V of 
A minor, then over I of C major (another III<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&#8211;I progression). The chorus&#8217;s final 
cadence occurs on the melodic notes G&#8211;F&#8211;E, doubled in octaves.</p>

<p>[43] Azucena&#8217;s two-strophe <i>canzone</i> acts as a middle section within the &#8220;Anvil 
Chorus&#8221; as a whole. As Petrobelli has pointed out, Azucena&#8217;s vocal line features 
a <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> of B4, sounding here as the fifth degree in E minor; her line 
descends by step within a conventional parallel period (scale degrees <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&#8211;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in the

increasingly overtaken by E5, which is harmonized in multiple ways within 
tonicizations of C major, A minor, and E minor. Azucena&#8217;s final cadence, 
G5&#8211;F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">5&#8211;E5 (<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&#8211;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&#8211;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in E minor), conspicuously echoes the chorus&#8217;s earlier cadence, 
G5&#8211;F5&#8211;E5 (<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&#8211;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>4</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&#8211;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in C major), especially since the final three pitches are 
approached similarly, are heard in similar rhythms, and receive similar 
orchestral punctuation (see <b>Example 11</b>). Following the <i>canzone</i> there is an 
abbreviated reprise of the chorus, followed by a quiet orchestral postlude. Only 
in the last two measures of the postlude is the melodic E relinquished in favor 
of the local tonic, the E&#8211;C third forming a link to the following number 
(&#8220;Racconto d&#8217;Azucena&#8221;).</p>

<p>[44] <b>Example 12</b> diagrams the melody of the &#8220;Anvil Chorus&#8221;; readers should also 
consult a score, either orchestral or piano-vocal. In the following discussion, 
I analyze Verdi&#8217;s melody using terms borrowed from modal and neo-modal theory.</p>
<p>[45] The principal ambitus of the melody lies between E4 and E5, solidly within 
Azucena&#8217;s mezzo-soprano range. The opening orchestral melody begins lower than 
this, however: starting on E4, it repeatedly touches the fifth degree both below 
and above, moving within the ambitus B3&#8211;B4, as though in a plagal mode (E 
Hypoaeolian). Once the key changes to G major, still within the orchestral 
prelude, the ambitus shifts upward, with the violins &#8220;reciting&#8221; on B4. When 
journeying beyond their reciting tone, the violins touch first on E5, then G5, 
before cadencing on G4; a G4&#8211;G5 octave is briefly outlined. The unison chorus 
then enters on G4 and moves upward by step to E5. As the orchestra settles onto 
V of A minor, E is heavily emphasized in both chorus and orchestra. The &#8220;anvil&#8221; 
theme features E as a reciting tone and decorates it with F, its semitone upper 
neighbor. Nevertheless, the melody moves mostly downward from E, traversing the 
octave E5&#8211;E4 (here I privilege the women&#8217;s register within the unison chorus) as 
if outlining the authentic mode on E (E Phrygian). The final climax is on G5, 
the highest sustained pitch in the entire number, followed by the G&#8211;F&#8211;E descent 
mentioned earlier. E has emerged as the melodic final, and the authentic octave, 
E4&#8211;E5, as the principal ambitus. G5 lies outside this ambitus but is used as a 
climax note; in Joachim Burmeister&#8217;s terms, it represents the figure <i>hyperbole</i>.<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> E5 has been featured prominently in four different keys: E minor, G major, A 
minor, and C major. The outlining of the modal fourth B4&#8211;E5 over a G-major 
harmony (measures 13&#8211;14) is an especially noteworthy instance of the melody&#8217;s 
independence from its accompaniment.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup></p>
<p>[46] The opening of the <i>canzone</i> remains within the E4&#8211;E5 ambitus while 
emphasizing B4 as a reciting tone. A secondary <i>sonorit&agrave;</i> of E5 is established, as 
we have seen, and soon becomes the principal focus; it is again exceeded by the 
cadential figure, this time G5&#8211;F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">5&#8211;E5. I have already noted the musical rhyme 
between the end of the chorus and that of the <i>canzone</i>. The similarity of ending 
formulas emphasizes the change from the neutral system (with F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/natural.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">) to the 
one-sharp system (with F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">). In neo-modal terms, the change could be 
described as one from E Phrygian to E Aeolian and back again (in the reprise of 
the chorus), following the Hypoaeolian orchestral prelude.</p>
<p>[47] Square brackets in example 12 demonstrate melodic correspondences within 
the &#8220;Anvil Chorus.&#8221; The legend at the bottom of the example labels individual 
motives, all of them scale fragments ranging from a second to a sixth in length. 
The number assigned to each motive indicates the size of its boundary interval: 
2 for a second, 3 for a third, etc. Motives with the same number and letter 
share the same pitch level; for example, motive 3B outlines the third from B4 to 
G4 in either direction. (All motives are shown descending, but this ordering is 
arbitrary.) The restriction to stepwise motives exhibits a certain Schenkerian 
bias, but it permits me to show stepwise motives that lie a little beneath the 
surface, such as the instance of motive 3B very near the beginning (measures 2&#8211;3). It 
is interesting that, within the orchestral prelude, motive 3B appears three 
times and in two different keys, E minor and G major. A disadvantage of the 
limitation to stepwise motives is that some quite audible correspondences do not 
appear, including one between measure 1 and measure 207, where the melody shares the 
descending fourth E4&#8211;B3, representing the lower fourth of a plagal ambitus.</p>
<h3 align="center">VII.</h3>
<p>[48] Especially in his later years, Verdi argued that Italian composers should 
focus their study on the Italian musical inheritance, not that of the Germans. 
The Germans do well to study Bach, he said, but Italians should learn from their 
Italian predecessors, stretching back to Palestrina. Verdi put this pedagogical 
philosophy into practice as early as the 1840s in his teaching of Emanuele 
Muzio, his longtime amanuensis.<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> I do not know how much early music Verdi 
knew, but it is remarkable how well the &#8220;Anvil Chorus&#8221; responds to theoretical 
concepts that predate major-minor tonality. Perhaps Verdi&#8217;s technique in 
<i>Il trovatore</i> seems innovative to us because, in some ways, it is so old.</p>
<p>[49] Bellini&#8217;s &#8220;Nel furor della tempesta&#8221; (Gualtiero&#8217;s cavatina) and Verdi&#8217;s 
&#8220;Anvil Chorus&#8221; have much in common. They do not so much explode the concept of 
bass-oriented tonal unity as they ignore it, <i>and they do so in an overwhelmingly 
diatonic way</i>. The musical language of both composers becomes more chromatic in 
later works (e.g., Bellini&#8217;s <i>Beatrice di Tenda</i> and Verdi&#8217;s <i>Otello</i>), but the 
excerpts examined here exhibit only the mildest chromaticism, thus contravening 
the idea (which apparently began with F&eacute;tis) that the dissolution of classical 
tonality is causally bound to increasing chromaticism and enharmonicism. Bailey, 
following Schoenberg, claims that Wagner eliminated the duality of major and 
minor and substituted, for twenty-four keys, twelve &#8220;chromatic keys&#8221; based on 
the tonic alone.<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup> Without addressing whether this is an accurate description 
of Wagner&#8217;s practice overall (it surely is for parts of <i>Tristan</i> and
<i>Parsifal</i>), 
it is untrue of the Italian composers who pioneered the use of tonal pairing. 
For them, what dissolved was less the distinction between <i>parallel</i> major and 
minor than that between <i>relative</i> major and minor. The parallel relation remained 
available, to be sure, but it was a supra-tonal diatonicism that Italian 
composers called upon when they wanted to combine tonal mobility with simplicity 
of melodic surface, as they often did. <span style="background-position: 0 0">
<i>S</i></span><i>onorit&agrave;</i> and diatonic system became more 
important as unifying factors than the choice of final note in the bass (tonic).</p>
<p>[50] Precedents for nineteenth-century Italian diatonicism may be found in the 
eighteenth century, mostly outside of Italy. Rameau wrote at length, in his <i>Code 
de musique pratique</i> (1760), on the possibility of harmonizing the same melodic 
&#8220;cadences&#8221; in a major key and its relative minor, and on the interlacing 
(<i>entrelacement</i>) of keys that may result. In the opera house, eighteenth-century 
audiences could hear Rameau&#8217;s interlacing of relative keys in the operatic 
romance. Daniel Heartz has traced the early history of this genre, which began 
in mid-century France.<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> As Heartz notes, many romances shifted from a minor 
key to its parallel major, but the self-conscious archaism of the genre 
sometimes led composers to write modal-sounding melodies in which the boundary 
between relative keys was blurred.<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup></p>
<p>[51] The most remarkable of eighteenth-century romances is surely &#8220;Im Mohrenland&#8221; from Mozart&#8217;s <i>Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</i> (1782). The shifting 
keys of this romance (example 13), which dissolves into spoken dialogue and thus 
has no fixed ending,<sup><a name="FN59REF" href="#FN59" id="footnote59">(59)</a></sup> can perhaps best be understood within a referential 
system of two sharps and a melodic final of F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">&ndash;F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> Phrygian, in other words. If 
our analysis addresses system, final, and ambitus (Pedrillo&#8217;s is F<img border="0" src="../../gifs/sharp.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top"> authentic), 
we are speaking in terms of Harold Powers&#8217; tonal types, not those of major-minor 
tonality.<sup><a name="FN60REF" href="#FN60" id="footnote60">(60)</a></sup> Since we are dealing with a musical texture in which there is one 
leading melody rather than a polyphonic web, there is no conflict between mode 
and tonal type.</p>

<p>[52] A recent study by Bal&aacute;zs Mikusi explores the interpenetration of relative 
keys in Felix Mendelssohn&#8217;s &#8220;Scottish&#8221; works.<sup><a name="FN61REF" href="#FN61" id="footnote61">(61)</a></sup> Mikusi notes that Mendelssohn 
also blends relative keys in other pieces in which an exotic flavor is intended, 
including the first of his &#8220;Venetian Gondola Songs&#8221; (G minor, no. 6 of the 
<i>Lieder ohne Worte</i> op. 19b, composed in 1830). The seven-measure introduction to 
the Gondola Song touches strongly on a tonicized B-flat major, albeit in a 
syntactically classical way, as III in the bass arpeggiation I&#8211;III&#8211;V&#8211;I. The 
four-note melody, representing the cry of the gondolier (obviously a tenor), is 
D4&#8211;F4&#8211;<nobr>E<img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="top">4</nobr>&#8211;D4, recalling Gualtiero&#8217;s pitch-cell in 
<i>Il pirata</i> (1827).

<p>[53] All of the compositional examples of <i>entrelacement</i> that we have just 
considered were motivated by exoticism, a desire to portray the Other, whether 
that Other resided at a distance of time (the neo-medieval French romance) or of 
space (Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Moorish land,&#8221; Mendelssohn&#8217;s Scotland) from the composer&#8217;s 
here and now. To a lesser degree, Othering may be detected in our two principal 
nineteenth-century examples, Bellini&#8217;s Gualtiero (an outlaw, though of noble 
birth) and Verdi&#8217;s Azucena (a gypsy and an outlaw). I chose these examples 
because they portray nineteenth-century Italian diatonicism, including its 
disregard for tonal unity, in an especially pure and striking form. On the other 
hand, what was exotic for Mozart and Mendelssohn quickly became routine for 
Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. Most Italian examples that one could cite betray 
no obvious exoticism. Common-tone tonality is a normal part of the Italian 
musical language from the late 1820s onward. As Kaminsky demonstrated in his 
study of Schumann&#8217;s piano cycles, it became normal for Schumann by the 
mid-1830s. The position of Schubert in this development&#8212;not only the degree of 
Rossini&#8217;s influence on Schubert, but the degree of Schubert&#8217;s influence on his 
immediate successors&#8212;is less clear and requires further research.</p>
<h3 align="center">VIII.</h3>
<p>[54] The notion that music of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries represents 
a &#8220;common practice&#8221; is a myth whose burial is long overdue. We have seen that 
classical tonality (as I choose to call it for want of a better term) does not 
always apply even to Mozart. Vestiges of pre-tonal practice survive to the end 
of the eighteenth century; post-classical practice begins soon after. An 
historical link between the two seems probable, especially in Catholic parts of 
Europe, where plainchant continued to be sung in variously modified forms.<sup><a name="FN62REF" href="#FN62" id="footnote62">(62)</a></sup> A 
later stage of this development is represented by the neo-modality of 
late-nineteenth-century French music (linked to the Gregorian revival) and, 
later still, by the neoclassicism of the early twentieth century. These 
developments all relate to what might be called the diatonic genus of 
common-tone tonality. The chromatic genus, which is the principal focus of 
neo-Riemannian theory, deserves separate historical consideration, which would 
again include Rossini and Verdi but also Meyerbeer and, of course, Wagner.</p>
<p>[55] Music theorists do not generally write music histories, but their 
perspective can benefit those who do. Nineteenth-century Italian opera is a 
worthy object of analytical study for its own sake. Such study can also teach us 
much about the history of compositional technique, and the contribution of 
composers both Italian and non-Italian to a European musical language that was 
undergoing rapid change, especially in the century&#8217;s middle decades. To see 
these developments clearly, however, we need to unlearn the unitary historical 
narratives imposed by German Romanticism and its offspring, Viennese Modernism. 
Theirs is not the only story that needs to be told, and their tendency to claim 
exclusive possession of aesthetic truth should be resisted. The tales of 
Hoffmann, Schumann, and Marx in the nineteenth century, and of Schenker and 
Schoenberg in the twentieth, were designed (in times of great political stress) 
first to establish German hegemony in music, then to preserve or regain it. 
Twenty-first-century North Americans need not be bewitched by their histories, 
their nationalism, or their aesthetics.</p>

Italian opera, is shown by his recently published <i>&Uuml;ber den Niedergang des

</i>24/1&#8211;2 (2005): 3&#8211;232. Interestingly, both Hanslick and Schenker modified their 
critical view somewhat where Verdi&#8217;s last operas were concerned; Hanslick in

pairing in several songs composed in the years 1815&#8211;17, although several 
scholars (including Krebs himself) have offered monotonal readings of &#8220;Meeres 
Stille,&#8221; his sole example from 1815. While Rossini seems not to have used these 
techniques as early as this, these are precisely the years during which Schubert 
composed some of his most overtly Italianate works, such as the Sixth Symphony 
and the two Overtures in Italian Style. Presumably Rossini was not the only 
Italian composer who influenced Schubert, a student of Salieri. Hascher argues 
that the modulatory style of Schubert&#8217;s sonata expositions changed abruptly in 
1817, and that the change involves the use of chromatic mediants as middleground 
harmonies.<br><a href="#FN41REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN42">42.</a> Specifically the Finale to Act 1 and the Septet in Act 2.<br><a href="#FN42REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN43">43.</a> Budden, <i>The Operas of Verdi </i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1973&#8211;81), 1:16.<br><a href="#FN43REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN44">44.</a> On the substantial differences between the autograph and first edition of

&#8220;dominant preparation&#8221; I mean an emphatic V or V<sup>7</sup> (root position) followed by a 
caesura. Using <b>M</b> for major and <b>m</b> for its relative minor, the four patterns are: 
(1) V/<b>m</b> to I/<b>M</b>; (2) V/<b>M</b> to I/<b>m</b>; (3) V/<b>m</b> to V/<b>M</b>; (4) V/<b>M</b> to V/<b>m</b>. (1) is by far 
the most common; it constitutes a III<img border='0' src='../../gifs/sharp.gif' width='7' height='18' align='top'>&#8211;I progression in the major key. (2) is 
relatively uncommon, probably because it resembles a conventional deceptive 
cadence, V&#8211;VI, in which VI is subsequently stabilized as a key; Italian 
composers preferred <img border='0' src='../../gifs/flat.gif' width='7' height='18' align='top'>VI in such cases. (3) is a favorite of Bellini; if the 
second V resolves to I, as it usually does, one can hear the entire progression 
as III<img border='0' src='../../gifs/sharp.gif' width='7' height='18' align='top'>&#8211;V&#8211;I in the major key, despite the presence of caesuras after one or both 
dominants. (4) is the pattern heard in ex. 7; relatively uncommon, it can be 
heard in retrospect as VII&#8211;V&#8211;I in the minor key. A magnificent example of (4) is 
the link from Amelia&#8217;s <i>scena</i> to her aria in Act 2 of Verdi&#8217;s 
<i>Un ballo in

virtuoso. Both Schumann and Wagner became more chauvinistic over the course of 
their careers. That Schenker held a low opinion of opera in general, not only 
Italian opera, is shown by his recently published <i>&Uuml;ber den Niedergang des 
Kompositionskunst</i> (&#8220;The Decline of the Art of Composition&#8221;), <i>Music Analysis
</i>24/1&#8211;2 (2005): 3&#8211;232. Interestingly, both Hanslick and Schenker modified their 
critical view somewhat where Verdi&#8217;s last operas were concerned; Hanslick in 
particular saw these as an approach toward German musical style.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">A strain of Italophilia (at least Verdi-philia) survived among some American 
composers, notably Roger Sessions and Donald Martino, both of whom enjoyed close 
friendships with Luigi Dallapiccola, an ardent Verdian. This seems to have had 
few consequences for their theoretical teaching, however. The list of 
&#8220;References to Musical Works&#8221; in Sessions&#8217; <i>Harmonic Practice</i> (1951), for 
example, includes a bit more Berlioz than one would find today, but otherwise it

in either context. See the Fondazione Rossini&#8217;s critical edition of <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, ed. M. Elizabeth C. Barlet (Pesaro, 1992), 1: xxxiii&#8211;xxxvii.</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">Weber&#8217;s chart has been the basis of recent studies of Schumann&#8217;s 
<i>Dichterliebe</i> by 
Fred Lerdahl (in <i>Tonal Pitch Space</i>) and Berthold Hoeckner (&#8220;Paths through 
<i>Dichterliebe</i>,&#8221; <i>19th-Century Music</i> 30, no. 1 [2006]: 65&#8211;80).</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv">Hoeckner, 71.</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">In the progression I&#8211;III&#8211;V, the V need not be tonicized. On the progression V&#8211;III&#8211;I see David Beach, &#8220;A recurring pattern in Mozart&#8217;s music,&#8221; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 27, no. 1 (1983): 1&#8211;29.</div><div id="fndiv38" class="flyoverdiv">The second-act finales of Rossini&#8217;s <i>Ermione</i> (1819) and
<i>Maometto II</i> (1820) also lack tonal closure. Both operas are in two acts.</div><div id="fndiv39" class="flyoverdiv">Some published scores give the chord in question as G major.</div><div id="fndiv40" class="flyoverdiv">According to the critical edition, the upper note of the trill is G except in 
m. 39, where it is G. This G is missing in some editions.</div><div id="fndiv41" class="flyoverdiv">According to Krebs, Schubert experimented with directional tonality and tonal 
pairing in several songs composed in the years 1815&#8211;17, although several 
scholars (including Krebs himself) have offered monotonal readings of &#8220;Meeres 
Stille,&#8221; his sole example from 1815. While Rossini seems not to have used these 
techniques as early as this, these are precisely the years during which Schubert 
composed some of his most overtly Italianate works, such as the Sixth Symphony 
and the two Overtures in Italian Style. Presumably Rossini was not the only 
Italian composer who influenced Schubert, a student of Salieri. Hascher argues 
that the modulatory style of Schubert&#8217;s sonata expositions changed abruptly in 
1817, and that the change involves the use of chromatic mediants as middleground 
harmonies.</div><div id="fndiv42" class="flyoverdiv">Specifically the Finale to Act 1 and the Septet in Act 2.</div><div id="fndiv43" class="flyoverdiv">Budden, <i>The Operas of Verdi </i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1973&#8211;81), 1:16.</div><div id="fndiv44" class="flyoverdiv">On the substantial differences between the autograph and first edition of 
<i>Il pirata</i>, see Philip Gossett&#8217;s introduction to the facsimile of the former (New 
York: Garland, 1983).</div><div id="fndiv45" class="flyoverdiv">&#8220;Ascolta&#8221; is the final word of Gualtiero&#8217;s
<i>scena</i> in the libretto. In Bellini&#8217;s 
setting, the word is delivered within the musical space of the aria.</div><div id="fndiv46" class="flyoverdiv">There are four ways of executing this dominant-preparation bait-and-switch; by 
&#8220;dominant preparation&#8221; I mean an emphatic V or V7 (root position) followed by a 
caesura. Using <b>M</b> for major and <b>m</b> for its relative minor, the four patterns are: 
(1) V/<b>m</b> to I/<b>M</b>; (2) V/<b>M</b> to I/<b>m</b>; (3) V/<b>m</b> to V/<b>M</b>; (4) V/<b>M</b> to V/<b>m</b>. (1) is by far 
the most common; it constitutes a III&#8211;I progression in the major key. (2) is 
relatively uncommon, probably because it resembles a conventional deceptive 
cadence, V&#8211;VI, in which VI is subsequently stabilized as a key; Italian 
composers preferred VI in such cases. (3) is a favorite of Bellini; if the 
second V resolves to I, as it usually does, one can hear the entire progression 
as III&#8211;V&#8211;I in the major key, despite the presence of caesuras after one or both 
dominants. (4) is the pattern heard in ex. 7; relatively uncommon, it can be 
heard in retrospect as VII&#8211;V&#8211;I in the minor key. A magnificent example of (4) is 
the link from Amelia&#8217;s <i>scena</i> to her aria in Act 2 of Verdi&#8217;s 
<i>Un ballo in 
maschera </i>(1859), in which the second dominant preparation consists of a solo for 
English horn, unaccompanied. See Powers, &#8220;&#8216;La dama velata&#8217;: Act II of

in maschera</i>,&#8221; in Martin Chusid, ed., <i>Verdi&#8217;s Middle Period</i>,
