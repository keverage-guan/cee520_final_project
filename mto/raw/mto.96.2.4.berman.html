<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] As this century draws to a close, historians in every field
attempt to inscribe a narrative path on the panoply of
twentieth-century events, a path leading from the rapidly receding
horizon of the last <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> to the turbulence of the present.
While some authors claim post-historicity for much of our decade,
others tell tales of continuing progress and evolution. In <i>Pyramids
at the Louvre</i>, Glenn Watkins uses the rubric of collage to explore
Modernism through its transition to Postmodernism, acknowledging
persistent signs of continuity even in the purported absence of
history.  Watkins offers a survey of twentieth-century music in which
history is structured by what he understands to be the primary
impulses underlying much of twentieth-century culture: the cultural
explosions and reconstitutions typical of our century, the access of
Europe and North America to each other and to the non-Western World,
and the interdisciplinarity of both culture and theory. Many of the
cultural events and artifacts scrutinized by Watkins are often
overlooked in more traditional music history textbooks, while familiar
works and issues&mdash;<i>The Rite of Spring</i>, the Stravinsky-Schoenberg
polemic&mdash;are seen from thoroughly new perspectives.<p>

[2] The greatest strength of Watkins&rsquo;s book lies in his approach to
the material: rather than move through the century along chronological
and/or national lines, as do many surveys, Watkins traces the
evolution of various musical and cultural trends, always keeping the
reader abreast of the ways in which these cultural currents inform and
influence each other.  Like many musicologists, Watkins approaches the
twentieth century via Debussy and Stravinsky.  In his discussion of
their work in the first two chapters, however, he focusses not on the
whole of their oeuvres or even on their roles in the history of
twentieth-century music, but rather on their contributions to the
orientalist explosion at the <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i>. This opening section on
orientalism functions in turn as an introduction to Watkins&rsquo;s
extensive treatment of Primitivism in the next six chapters. Arguably
the richest of the book, these chapters establish what Watkins
considers to be one of the primary conditions of twentieth-century
Modernism: Primitivism, in its multifarious guises and manifestations,
as well as the modern West&rsquo;s fascination with all things &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;
and its willingness to construe much of what defines twentieth-century
culture as primitive, continually surfaces throughout the rest of the
book.  In section three, &ldquo;Clockwork,&rdquo; Watkins tackles the issue of
Stravinsky as a musical cubist, and investigates Modernist
Primitivism&rsquo;s potential for accommodating forces such as Cubism; in
section four, &ldquo;Masquerades,&rdquo; Watkins deals with the <i>commedia
dell&rsquo;arte</i>, the allure of machine technology (whose capacity for
depersonalization gave Primitivism new meaning between the wars), and
Stravinsky&rsquo;s <i>Oedipus</i> and <i>Agon</i>; and finally in section six, he
addresses the issue of collage head on, reviewing some of the material
previously covered, and discussing music and culture from World War II
until the present.<p>

[3] The interdisciplinary perspective that Watkins brings to his
subject matter allows him the flexibility not only to collect a huge
variety of material in one volume, but also to examine from a variety
of viewpoints the subjects that most interest him.  This is good news
for Stravinsky enthusiasts: Watkins explores the composer and his work
from many different angles, several of them new, all of them
insightful and provocative.  Not only does Stravinsky make appearances
as an orientalist, a primitivist, a modernist, and a classicist, but
also, and most intriguingly, as a cubist and a simultaneist.<p>

[4] <i>Pyramids at the Louvre</i> is impressive in its scope, covering, as
its subtitle states, &ldquo;music, culture and collage from Stravinsky to
the postmodernists.&rdquo;  The intended audience seems to be undergraduate
music students and educated laypersons with an interest in
twentieth-century music and culture: technical terms, when used, are
briefly defined in parentheses, and Watkins does not usually include
observations that must be substantiated by in-depth musical analysis
(although he does refer the reader to sources which offer more
detailed analyses of works which he discusses from a theoretical
perspective).  Nevertheless, such a substantial amount of information
is put forth by Watkins that even the most seasoned musicologist has
much to glean.<p>

[5] The enormity of such an undertaking has its drawbacks, however.
On reading the book, the focus often seems almost too broad: this
veritable smorgasbord of material is not always cohesive, intriguing
specificities are often not fully explored, and some of the discussion
suffers from an anecdotal superficiality.  In his albeit captivating
discussion of machine technology in chapter 12, &ldquo;Masks and Machines,&rdquo;
for example, Watkins travels in a matter of pages from Antheil&rsquo;s
<i>Ballet Mecanique</i> through Adorno&rsquo;s opinions on culture and technology
to the music of John Zorn and Michael Daugherty. This whirlwind tour
is fascinating; a slower pace would permit the reader more thoroughly
to absorb the sights along the way.  In the same chapter, Watkins
introduces the idea of a &ldquo;new humanity&rdquo; prevalent among artists in the
1920s (page 334).  Watkins could have placed greater stress on the fact
that this wave of utopic striving permeated the arts and sciences,
from architecture to physical fitness, from Italy to France and
Germany.  This quest for utopia was discussed both in the mainstream
media and in alternative publications.  In the Parisian journal
<i>l&rsquo;Esprit nouveau</i>, for example, the desire for a new humanity
characteristic of the time is manifest both in cultural commentary and
in articles on physical fitness.  One of the journal&rsquo;s regular
columnists, Dr. Winter (his area of expertise was health and physical
fitness), wrote in 1923 about the link of the architecture of Le
Corbusier to a new spirituality and a new awareness of physical
health: &ldquo;When will we have the habitations of Le Corbusier&mdash;his
cities, his interiors?  Soon, soon, because we need a new space in
which to live <nobr>. . .</nobr>  Society, seen from this new angle, must be
entirely rebuilt <nobr>. . .</nobr>  We have abandoned our bodies to the doctors
like we used to abandon our spirits to the priests <nobr>. . .</nobr>  A new body,
rich with a new spirit, will express itself tomorrow<nobr>. . .</nobr> &rdquo; (<i>l&rsquo;Esprit
nouveau</i>, no month, 1923, pages 1756&ndash;1758).  Yet when Watkins introduces
the &ldquo;new humanity,&rdquo; as it relates to Leger&rsquo;s <i>Ballet Mecanique</i> and
film, he leaves the reader unaware of its greater significance and the
momentum it carried outside the realm of this work.  Given this lack
of context, the reader is left somewhat confused at the key sentence,
&ldquo;Th[e] unmediated emphasis upon pure form and primary shape stood at
the heart of the new humanity and bonded naturally to the Purist&rsquo;s
celebration of the technological transformation of existence&rdquo; (page
335).  Observations such as this abound; the reader is often left to
unpack the many important concepts lurking within sometimes murky
prose.<p>

[6] Much recent writing on Modernism and Postmodernism deals
critically with works of art, approaching them not as autonomous
aesthetic objects but rather as cultural constructs, texts imbued with
sociopolitical significance; from this perspective works of art are
often understood, for example, as manifestations of patriarchal power
structures or colonialist venture. Watkins, however, makes his stance
clear from the beginning:<p>

<blockquote>
<nobr>. . .</nobr>  the perceptions recorded here were intended less as a lively, 
frontal assault on a recent species of musicological reductionism 
given to pruning away contextual detail than as an affectionate 
attempt to return to the musicological discourse many of the 
approaches that have been somewhat aggressively strained out in recent 
years <nobr>. . .</nobr> (page 8).
</blockquote>
<p>

[7] Watkins&rsquo;s affection for his subject matter shines through on every
page, and indeed makes for a refreshing alternative to some recent
writing on similar subjects.  Nevertheless, his defensiveness with
regard to recent musicological and critical inquiry sometimes detracts
from his arguments.  For example, in chapter 6, &ldquo;Josephine and Jonny,&rdquo;
Watkins includes as an illustration a poster used to advertise <i>La
Revue negre</i>, a music-hall act performing at the <i>Theatre des
Champs-Elysees</i> in Paris in 1926. The black performers portrayed in
the poster are caricatured such that they clearly resemble baboons:
from our late-twentieth-century North American perspective, we can not
help but cringe. In response to this anticipated reaction, Watkins
tries to dismiss the reader&rsquo;s immediate impression by explaining that
caricature in this case can be traced &ldquo;to minstrelsy&rsquo;s own venerable
tradition of parody and burlesque,&rdquo; and that the painter, Paul Colin,
was interested in &ldquo;ethnological and historical perspectives rather
than racist portraiture&rdquo; (page 142&ndash;43).  While these statements in
themselves may be true, Watkins&rsquo;s discussion of the matter would have
been greatly enhanced had he addressed not only the intent of the
artist, Paul Colin, but also the ways in which images such as these
were received by the European public.  In this way he would have made
explicit some of the pervasive views (acknowledged implicitly by
Watkins elsewhere in the book) held by Europeans regarding Africans
and African-Americans.  As Watkins illustrates in his discussion of
Josephine Baker, African-Americans may have been subjected less
overtly to racism in Paris than in New York; nevertheless, Africa,
like the Orient, functioned as &ldquo;them&rdquo; to Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;us,&rdquo; representing
Europe&rsquo;s own pre-history, a place and time lower down and further back
on the evolutionary scale.<p>

[8] A more critical approach would have enhanced several of Watkins&rsquo;s
otherwise fascinating revelations.  In chapter 3, for example, Watkins
seems to excuse the practice of displaying Samoan, Sudanese and Indian
villages replete with human inhabitants &ldquo;as part of a typical summer&rsquo;s
entertainment&rdquo; at the Dresden Zoo in the summer months between 1905
and 1910.  Apparently the villages complemented the Benin bronzes and
Mexican artifacts on display in the Dresden Ethnographic Museum, and
contrasted with contemporaneous practices at the Bronx Zoo, where
villagers were displayed as captives in cages rather than as
&ldquo;commercial <i>Volkerschauen</i> in the zoological gardens&rdquo; (pages 77&ndash;78).
In his refusal to discuss the political implications of these
practices, perhaps for fear of denigrating the Western art influenced
in some way by them, Watkins tries the reader&rsquo;s faith in his exegeses.
Given that he takes the reader through to the late twentieth century
and purports to deal with Modern and Postmodern culture, some
discussion of the colonialist and post-colonialist implications of
practices such as these would have added a rich dimension;
furthermore, this type of discussion need not dull the appeal of the
works dealt with.  Indeed, knowledge of some of the underlying
colonialist implications of Primitivism helps us gain not only an
understanding of the cultural exploitation and appropriation by the
West of other cultures, but also, and more importantly in this
context, an awareness of the ways in which Western artists used
Primitivist techniques in order to critique Western values.<p>

[9] Much recent writing on Primitivism and colonialism addresses the  
issue of displaying &ldquo;tribal&rdquo; peoples: such exhibitions not only  
symbolized the extent of the &ldquo;mother&rdquo; country&rsquo;s territories, but also  
indicated the lower evolutionary stages that the West believed these  
cultures represented.  Any pretense to scientific inquiry, however,  
did not diminish the overriding experience on the part of Western  
viewers of being witness to an exotic spectacle (for a pictorial  
representation of such a scene see <i>The Whites Visiting the Blacks</i>  
from <i>Fliegender Bl&auml;tter</i> 1905, reproduced in Colin Rhodes,  
<i>Primitivism and Modern Art</i>, page 95).  Colonialism required that  
subject peoples be described, presented, or represented by the  
colonial power in order that the mother country could continue to  
exercise control over them.  Institutional Western representations of  
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; peoples were based on the administrative needs of the  
mother country, and thus were often mere stereotypes.  Primitivism in  
modern art, however, must also be seen within the context of the  
critical stance taken by the moderns to many of the cultural  
institutions and disciplines of the modern West, and, indeed, to  
modernism itself.  In their search for and summoning of the  
Primitive, modern artists reacted against the notion of scientific  
progress, increasing urbanization, rationalism, and formalism;  
against, in sum, the very foundations of modern Western civilization.  
However, as Colin Rhodes explains (<i>Primitivism and Modern Art</i>  
[London, 1994]), modern artists paradoxically had to rely on the  
definitions of the primitive created and maintained by the very  
institutions and disciplines of which they were critical.<p>

[10] The time is ripe to view works such as <i>Le Sacre</i> in light of the
Modernist&rsquo;s disillusionment with modernity itself. Yes, as Watkins
clearly demonstrates, <i>Le Sacre</i> was received as &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo; and its
critical reception reveals the mutability of the Primitivist identity
in the pre-World War I period: <i>Le Sacre&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo; rhythms, while
often understood to be relics of pagan Russia, were just as easily
interpreted as African, Oriental, Caribbean, and North American
Indian.  But how did the work, in its music, dance and set design,
critique or even transgress Western values?  We would demean
Stravinsky in no way by considering the highly cherished Western
binarisms that were destabilized by the composer <i>et al</i> in <i>Le
Sacre</i>: individual/collectivity, nature/culture, us/them, to name a
few.  In several ways, Stravinsky and company implied that the
eminently civilized Parisian audience was not as distant from the
primitives portrayed on stage as they would like to have believed;
indeed this suggestion was confirmed at the outbreak of World War I
one year after the premiere of <i>Le Sacre</i>.<p>

[11] Only by engaging more fully with issues of colonialism and
Western identity can many of the most fundamental impulses informing
twentieth-century culture be fully explored.  Even Watkins&rsquo;s use of
collage as a category encompassing the diverse trends of the twentieth
century demands closer scrutiny with regard to these issues.  Watkins
uses the term <i>collage</i> as a metaphor: &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>  citation refers less to
thematic recall of familiar tunes than to the assemblage and
rearrangement of a rich parade of cultural loans,&rdquo; and juxtaposition
&ldquo;italicizes complementary qualities in the seemingly contradictory&rdquo;
(page 3).  The metaphor allows him access to an enormous number of
twentieth-century works.  Although he admirably manages to distinguish
many of the various ways in which citation and juxtaposition occur in
twentieth-century music, he does not explicitly address the ways in
which collage techniques serve to confirm or challenge aspects of
Western cultural identity; nor do his discussions of the reasons
behind collage&rsquo;s &ldquo;rising tide of glamour&rdquo; (page 3) take into account
issues of Western cultural identity.  It goes without saying that the
cultures &ldquo;on loan&rdquo; are generally borrowed by the West from non-Western
cultures, or from the non-modernized West (in the case of some folk
and popular borrowings); the complementary qualities enhanced through
juxtaposition are often those that have been thoroughly repressed in
the culture doing the juxtaposing.  Watkins tends to play down these
perspectives, even though his book is based implicitly on them.
Consider: &ldquo;That artists have not always avoided value judgments and
have exhibited an occasional tendency to devalue as they plundered,
cannot be denied. The view of the East as opulent, colorful, and
intriguing but also by turns sinister, menacing, and erotic has
clearly fueled Western appetites both political and artistic.  On all
fronts, however, investigation generally has led not so much to a
discovery of passions felt in the East that were absent in the West as
to the capacity to paint them in more vivid tones for having been
observed at some remove from mundane experience&rdquo; (page 15).<p>

[12] As Edward Said and other authors have argued, the Orient as such
(as well as Africa, Oceania, and other non-Western cultures) is to
some extent an invention of the West; the West used (and still uses)
the East as a site of projective identification, a mirror with which
to explore aspects of its own identity. Whether or not devaluation and
plundering are involved is in some respects almost irrelevant; more
important is the fact that cultural appropriation, with or without
attendant exploitation, allows the West to continually confirm,
challenge and create its own identity. Watkins often hints at this
state of affairs, but never states it explicitly, again, I think, for
fear of accusing composers themselves of cultural exploitation,
devaluing and plundering. While perhaps an artist can be exempt in
some circumstances from colonialist rhetoric and activity, the culture
of which that artist is a member surely can not.  To paraphrase Said,
a European comes up against the Orient as a European first, an
individual second (<i>Orientalism</i>, page 11).  A more critical look at the
notion of collage would also tell us more about the techniques
involved as well as the thoughts of composers regarding these
techniques.  For example, do instances of citation, influence and
juxtaposition always constitute collage?<p>

[13] For anyone with even a passing interest in the kaleidoscopic
cultural landscape of our century, <i>Pyramids at the Louvre</i> is well
worth becoming acquainted with; for students of twentieth-century
music history, this volume (or at least parts thereof) should be
required reading.  Watkins&rsquo;s treatment of the back-and-forth
transatlantic influences in the first half of the century (see
especially chapter 8) is unparalleled, and of great interest to anyone
pursuing questions of crossover idioms.  His insights, observations
and hypotheses are not only original but often scintillating (see for
example, his theory that the first of Stravinsky&rsquo;s <i>Three Pieces for
String Quartet</i> of 1914 was intended as part of a theatrical
presentation, <i>David</i>, proposed by Cocteau [page 235]), and never fail
to stimulate the imagination. He writes with a sense of sincerity and
depth of feeling for his subject, and draws on a wealth of research as
well as on his own personal experience of and love for this
material. Watkins is to be commended for providing a point of
departure for a myriad of destinations throughout the twentieth
century.</p>
