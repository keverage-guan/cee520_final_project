<p style="text-align: center"><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>[1] Listeners to Milton Babbitt&rsquo;s music have criticized it for being 
excessively abstract or perceptually random. Performers of Babbitt&rsquo;s work have 
often expressed similar attitudes, feeling straight-jacketed by the score&rsquo;s 
specificity on the one hand, or glossing over detailed accuracy on the other. 
The complaints from both sides imply that the rigor of Babbitt&rsquo;s music precludes 
expressivity and freedom of interpretation. </p>
<p>

[2] Our paper argues that Babbitt&rsquo;s music finds an astonishing richness of 
expression within and because of its constraints, and that performers can 
similarly find interpretive freedom within the confines of the notated score. 
Only by exploring this interpretive freedom can performers communicate the 
compositional freedom expressed in Babbitt&rsquo;s works. </p>
<p>

[3] We construe these tensions between rigor and freedom as a particular type of 
virtuosity that lies at the heart of Babbitt&rsquo;s music. In the words of Andrew 
Mead, &ldquo;Much of the power of Babbitt&rsquo;s music is generated from the interaction, 
even opposition, between the surface and background.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Or those of Luciano Berio: 
&ldquo;Virtuosity often arises out of a conflict, a tension between the musical idea 
and the instrument, between concept and musical substance<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[4]
&ldquo;Virtuosity&rdquo; usually refers to exceptional technical skill in performance 
(sometimes to the detriment of musicality). In its early Italian usage, however, 
virtuosity implied <i>virtu</i> or excellence in composition or theory as well as 
performance.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The true virtuoso exhibited extraordinary artistic and expressive 
abilities in addition to technical facility. </p>
<p>

[5]
Our co-authored paper examines Babbitt&rsquo;s <i>None but the <i>Lonely Flute</i></i> for 
unaccompanied flute (1991) from the points of view of flutist and theorist. We 
focus on the virtuosity&mdash;compositional and performative, apparent and 
hidden&mdash;that permeates the work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>* * *</b></p>
<p>

[6]
The performer of <i>Lonely Flute</i> faces virtuosic demands in many arenas. Difficult 
couplings of register and dynamic (high-register <i>pianissimo,</i> for example), rapid 
changes of register and dynamic, complex rhythms, twelve pages of a single 
acrobatic line with few rests and no opportunities for page turns&mdash;these and 
other features demand precise control and flexibility of embouchure, air stream, 
and mental focus, not to mention sheer physical endurance. </p>
<p>

[7]
In addition to these more obvious manifestations of virtuosity, <i>Lonely Flute
</i>demands a deeper level of understanding. The precise notation of the score hides 
rich musical cross-references, challenging the performer to project both 
registral/dynamic counterpoint and long surface line, to recreate and 
communicate the &ldquo;swing&rdquo; of the rhythms, and to shape the trajectory of details 
and whole.</p>
<p>

[8]
This deeper virtuosity develops through a learning process that moves from the 
basic terms of the work to a reinvention and communication of it. In other 
words, one can neither skip over the precision demanded by the score, nor stop 
with an accurate rendition. </p>
<p>

[9]
We felt that it was important to describe EM&rsquo;s process in learning this work, 
particularly with regard to a much-debated aspect of Babbitt&rsquo;s music&mdash;the role 
of its notated meters. She began, as with any musical work, by making sense of 
the piece&rsquo;s notation, and translating it into physical actions and coordinations. 
At this first step, <i>Lonely Flute&rsquo;s</i> notated meters seemed to contradict its 
rhythms, and even worse, to add superfluous complexity to already difficult 
material. As she continued to study the work, however, she began to make sense 
of the notated meters: they imply a beat and thus help the performer stay on 
rhythmic &ldquo;track.&rdquo; She decided that convergences of rhythm and meter indicate 
important musical markers, and that divergences suggest freer and more fluid 
interpretation. In a third learning phase, she internalized the physical and 
interpretive decisions already made; the rhythmic shocks and stresses of the 
music became familiar, almost trivial. Finally, she began to speak through the 
piece&mdash;to retell the story in her own voice&mdash;playing the familiar gestures as if 
improvising them. By this point, the notated meters functioned like an implied 
rhythm section over which she, like a jazz flutist, soloed.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[10]
Each performance, of course, occasions a fresh retelling. The density of 
information in <i>Lonely Flute</i> in particular provides much to rediscover, reinvent, 
and reinterpret in each performance. In short, performative virtuosity in this 
work includes but necessarily goes beyond its technical and reading demands, to 
interpretation, internalization, and identification.</p>

<p>

[11]
Compositional virtuosity lies in the work&rsquo;s abstract pre-compositional 
structure, in its realization, and in the play of its structure, surface, and 
external associations (Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s song &ldquo;None but the Lonely Heart,&rdquo; Op.6 
No.6). The elegance of Babbitt&rsquo;s arrays (and their explorations of &ldquo;maximal 
diversity&rdquo;) is well known.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> <i>Lonely Flute</i> presents an all-partition array of 6 
lynes and 58 aggregates, using a row based on the Type D hexachord [012678]. The 
array is a hyperaggregate; that is, it contains 48 row statements, one of each 
member of its row class.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> <i>Lonely Flute</i> presents the array once in the pitch 
domain, and three of its 8 blocks (at T<sub>6</sub>) in the time domain.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Pitch-class (pc) 
lyne pairs are articulated by register (low-high) and time-point (tp) lynes by 
dynamics (correspondingly soft-loud). <b>Example 1</b> and the corresponding score in 
<b>Example 2</b> show the beginnings of the pc and tp arrays and their realizations. In 
the pc array (Example 1a) each lyne pair corresponds to an octave; individual 
lynes are not distinguished within their pairs. In the tp array (Example 1b) 
dynamics from <i>pianissimo</i> to <i>fortissimo</i> articulate individual lynes. </p>

[12]
Babbitt&rsquo;s virtuosic treatment of the composing out of his arrays is also well 
documented. In <i>Lonely Flute</i>, the single composite flute line resulting from the 
interweaving of registral and dynamic lynes references the pc array in multiple 
ways. <b>Example 3</b>, which aligns with the staff line immediately below 
it, 
demonstrates three such modes of reference:</p>
<ol>
	<li>row segment. &lt;078621&gt; is the first hexachord of a row form.</li>
<li>array-lyne segment respecting partitions. This passage references a lyne 
segment from a distant portion of the array (cf. Example 
6a). Each partition is 
represented by a separate attack (such as the two C's at the beginning) or 
string of equal durations (&lt;8621&gt;); blank partitions (~) are represented by 
dynamic changes on tied notes (the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&rsquo;s at the end of the line).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></li>
	<li>single partition of an array lyne via an equal-duration string. The 
cardinality of the partition (here 4) equals that of the equal-duration string; 
elements may be rhythmically selected.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>[13] Babbitt&rsquo;s virtuosity in his use of tp arrays is less universally acknowledged. 
In <i>Lonely Flute</i>, the array remains largely hidden, since 1) it does not 
establish its durational unit (
<img border="0" src="sixteenth.gif" width="12" height="21"> ) or its modulus ( 
<img border="0" src="dottedhalf.GIF">) by the musical surface or 
the notated meter,<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> and 2) it does not clearly distinguish between 
<i>bona fide</i> tps 
and those evenly-spaced attacks that subdivide durations between tps.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Furthermore, as noted earlier, the notated meter fluctuates dramatically in its 
distance not only from the tp array, but also from the musical surface.</p>

<p>[14] This distance between tp array, notated meter, and musical surface prompts some 
interpreters to question the perceptual relevance of Babbitt&rsquo;s precise time 
points, durations, and even tempi. Joel Lester, for example, suggests that one 
does not hear metric hierarchy (much less the particular notated meters) in 
Babbitt&rsquo;s music, that therefore one cannot accurately perceive durations or 
their relations, and that as a result analyses of Babbitt&rsquo;s notated rhythms may 
be misguided.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Some recordings and performances of <i>Lonely Flute</i> imply a similar 
interpretation, taking its notated rhythms with a fair degree of liberty.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[15] We propose, however, that the perceptual impact of these various rhythmic levels 
derives not from one-to-one correspondences, but from fluctuations in their degree 
of correspondence. It is the play of distances among timepoints, notated meter, 
and rhythmic surface that manifests itself to performer and listener. </p>


<p>[16] The opening of 
<i>Lonely Flute</i> introduces this interaction of levels. <b>Example 4a</b> shows the work&rsquo;s opening divided into three phrases, each ending with a soft 
long note. (The three phrases as a whole are set off by a rest, and by a change 
from prevailing softer dynamic levels to<i> f / ff </i>in measure 10ff.). Each phrase begins 
with a clearly articulated downbeat (
<img border="0" src="arrow1.gif" width="11" height="17" align="texttop"> ): at measure 2 (&ldquo;substituting&rdquo; for measure 1), measure 4, 
measure 7, and measure 10. In this way, the notated meter surfaces at important junctures. </p>
<p>[17] Furthermore, the third of these phrases (measures 7&ndash;9) sounds distinctly &ldquo;square&rdquo; 
rhythmically in relation to its surroundings. It not only expresses the 
quarter-note pulse and downbeats of the notated meter, but its boundary 
downbeats (measure 7, 10) articulate tp 0. This phrase thus marks the first alignment 
in the work of rhythmic surface, notated meter, and tp 0 of the array (
<img border="0" src="arrow2.gif" width="11" height="17" align="texttop"> ). </p>
<p>[18] This alignment of the stars heralds a portentous moment. The almost comical 
effect highlights several ironic references to Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s song &ldquo;None But the 
Lonely Heart&rdquo; (labeled LH). The last LH in Example 4a quotes <b>Example 4b</b> at exact 
pitch displaced by two octaves.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>
<p>[19] Such passages call for the performer to subtly emphasize the metric regularity, 
in contrast to the prevailing irregularity. Here are a few ways in which EM does 
this. She clearly establishes the downbeat of measure 7, despite the <i>pianissimo</i> 
dynamics, undistinguished articulation, and repeated pitch, by using a fuller 
and more rounded tone, and by making the initial <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> stronger than the 
succeeding low E&rsquo;s. Her articulation carefully connects the <i>pp</i> and <i>mp</i> E&rsquo;s at 
beat 3, and then, avoiding emphasis on beat 3, her vibrato and articulation lead 
the motion through to the downbeat of the following bar. In this way, she uses 
breath accents, vibrato, timbre, and varied tonguing to emphasize downbeats and 
otherwise give direction to the rhythm, without distorting Babbitt&rsquo;s notated 
indications. </p>
<p>[20] Passages that are more complex rhythmically also require rhythmic clarity, but 
in a manner that sounds spontaneous. <i>Lonely Flute</i>&rsquo;s rhythms thus challenge the 
performer both to learn them accurately and to convey them effectively.</p>

<p>[21] The last &ldquo;square&rdquo; phrase alludes not only to Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lonely Heart,&rdquo; but 
also to the climax of <i>Lonely Flute</i> in its rhythmic, pitch, motivic, and dynamic 
structure (in ways in which we will not detail here). The climax, which can be 
heard in <b>Example 5</b>, occurs 
approximately 2/3 of the way through the work. </p>
<p>[22] Even more than the opening passage, the climax displays skillful manipulation of 
distances between structure and surface. (See Example 5 and corresponding array 
aggregates in <b>Example 6</b>.) The passage begins with relatively clear meter and 
straightforward rhythm: articulated downbeats and&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="sixteenth.gif" width="12" height="21"> subdivisions indicate 
closeness both to the notated meter and to the&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="sixteenth.gif" width="12" height="21"> grid of the tp structure. At 
measure 104, however, an extended soliloquy in high register and <i>pianissimo</i> dynamic 
seems to suspend time. This passage&mdash;three concatenated strings of equal 
subdivisions (based on&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="dottedsixteenth.GIF"> and an 11-tuplet)&mdash;articulates no downbeats and no array tps! It thus &ldquo;steps out of time,&rdquo; distancing itself from the notated meter and 
from the steady 16th-note tp grid governing the piece.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
<p>[23] This &ldquo;out-of-time&rdquo; passage falls at the end of tp aggregate 15&mdash;the only tp 
aggregate in the work restricted to <i>p / pp</i> dynamics. The portion of the tp array 
used in <i>Lonely Flute</i> contains no single-dynamic aggregates,<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> so in order to 
sustain a single dynamic&mdash;here <i>pp</i>&mdash;Babbitt must momentarily suspend the 
time-point array. And this is what he does.</p>
<p>[24] Ironically, this expression of greatest distance between <i>tp array</i> and surface 
coincides with the projection of closest relation between <i>pc array</i> and surface. 
Here the bare bones of the pc array&mdash;its underlying row projected as a single lyne (the 12<sup>1</sup> partition, aggregate 39)&mdash;surface, in the form of the only pc 
aggregate restricted to the high register.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Thus the passage&rsquo;s ethereal quality 
results, paradoxically, from closeness to the pc array (high register) and 
distance from the tp array (<i>pianissimo</i> dynamic and rhythmic fluidity). </p>
<p>[25] This passage greatly challenges the performer by combining &ldquo;opposites&rdquo; in modes 
of pc and tp lyne articulation (high and soft). She must switch from the fast 
and precise changes in embouchure and air flow required by the changing dynamics 
and register of the rest of the work, to the sustained control and air demanded 
by the extended <i>pianissimo</i> high <i>legato</i> line of this passage. The lyrical melody 
in high register sounds serene and effortless, but is perhaps the most difficult 
passage in the piece; the apparent calm conceals virtuosic effort. </p>



<p>[26] Near the end of the work, a notable (if fleeting) passage refers back to the 
climactic soliloquy. (See <b>Example 
7</b>, and compare to Examples 5 and 6). As shown 
in Example 7a, this riff indexes the 12<sup>1</sup> partition of the climax. This passage 
and the climactic passage, however, could not come from more contrasting 
pc-array sources&mdash;the one (Example 
6a) from the sole single-lyne partition 
demonstrating maximum closeness to the array, and the other (Example 
7b) from 
portions of two array partitions distributed across all 6 lynes. These 
contrasting distances from the pc array manifest themselves in the climax&rsquo;s 
adherence to a single register, and in the later passage&rsquo;s dancing among all 
three registers. </p>
<p>[27] Both passages distance themselves from the tp array via equal-duration strings 
(based on the dotted 16th in the first case, and on the dotted 32nd in the 
second), resulting in single soft dynamics (<i>pp</i> and <i>p</i> respectively). The 
climactic passage, however, expresses the longest-lasting pc aggregate of the 
work, while the later fragment skips through its pc aggregate in record time 
(less than 2 seconds).<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>[28] The intricacy of these cross-references demonstrates a virtuosic compositional 
command of &ldquo;maximal diversity,&rdquo; and demands a similar range of performative 
control. The flutist must sustain a long <i>pianissimo</i> line in high register in the 
first case, and maintain a constant <i>piano</i> dynamic across widely-ranging 
registers in the second.</p>
<p>[29] These two passages exemplify one challenge of the work&rsquo;s dynamics&mdash;their 
rebellion against the flute&rsquo;s intrinsic linkage of dynamics and register. A 
second challenge lies in carving out six differentiated dynamic levels within 
the instrument&rsquo;s limited dynamic range. Such exigencies may tempt the performer 
to homogenize dynamics, but she can call upon supplemental resources such as 
timbre and vibrato to help in the dynamic definition so crucial to the work. 
(Paradoxically, Babbitt&rsquo;s detailed control of pitch, rhythm, and dynamic 
contrasts with sparse specifications of articulation and timbre; the performer 
must inflect, shape, and emphasize, and can discover and communicate whimsy and 
surprise.) </p>

<p>[30] <i>Lonely Flute</i>&rsquo;s compositional virtuosity extends beyond its structure and 
multiple cross-references to its pacing of events. <b>Example 
8</b> graphs the 
durations of pc aggregates through the piece. One can observe (a) a rather 
relaxed pace at the opening, (b) a generally faster pace in the
<img border="0" src="quarter.gif" width="8" height="19" align="texttop"> = 90 section, 
	(c) dipping to the slowest point at the climax, then (d) jagged fluctuations 
leading to the fastest point (the &ldquo;riff&rdquo; just discussed). </p>
<p>[31] The pacing of pc aggregates depends largely on the rhythmic surface created by 
the realization of the tp array. Babbitt stretches tp aggregates by repeating 
tps and/or inserting strings of equal durations.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> The longer the tp aggregate, 
therefore, the farther it lies from the tp array, and (usually) the greater the 
number of pc aggregates it encompasses.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

<p>[32] <b>Example 
9a</b> shows the pacing of pc and tp aggregates relative to one another; 
aggregate durations are represented proportionally, as well as (within each 
series) by lighter/darker shading.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> <b>Example 9b</b> graphs the approximate number of 
pc aggregates per tp aggregate. The ratio begins and ends at approximately 1:1, 
hovers around 2 or 3:1 for much of the work, and peaks noticeably at 5:1 just 
before the end.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>
<p>[33] The approximate 1:1 ratio that begins and ends the work produces a sort of 
declamation appropriate to these moments in the rhetoric. One can almost 
conceive of the passages as prelude and postlude, an effect resulting also from 
specific pitch, pc, rhythmic, and motivic links which we will not discuss here.</p>
<p>[34] In general, the speed of pc aggregates, interacting with the speed of tp 
aggregates and equal-duration strings, combines with registral and dynamic flux 
to create widely varying rates of surface activity. We have already seen how 
these factors combine at the work&rsquo;s climax to create a soaring floating unmoored 
effect, and at the fast &ldquo;riff&rdquo; prior to the piece&rsquo;s denouement to produce a 
sudden flurry of registers and dynamics. This choreography of pc- and tp-aggregate 
pacing shapes the flow of <i>Lonely Flute</i>, and demonstrates a compositional mastery 
of event pacing.</p>
<p>[35] Though we speak of widely-varying rates of activity, <i>Lonely Flute</i>&rsquo;s overall pace 
is quite fast. Edward T. Cone writes of different rhythmic levels characterizing 
different stylistic eras: the beat the Baroque period, the measure the Classical 
style, and the hypermeasure the Romantic era.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> In our opinion <i>Lonely Flute</i> 
resembles the Baroque in its faster basic rhythmic level, and in the seamless 
aspect of its motion.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> The (sub-tactus) 16th note forms the basic level of 
motion, with the faster and slower levels of the rhythmic surface cutting in and 
out over the implicit &ldquo;rhythm section&rdquo; of the notated meter. Unlike music of the 
Baroque, however, where harmonic progression underlies the sense of motion, here 
pc and tp aggregates continually recycle, changing not in their content but in 
their registral and dynamic disposition and temporal pacing. </p>
<p>[36] As in Baroque music, the performer has great license in matters of timbre, 
articulation, and temporal shaping. Indeed, these parameters take on great 
import in the context of the continual spinning out of <i>Lonely Flute</i>&rsquo;s materials. 
The shaping of this perpetual motion is perhaps the performer&rsquo;s greatest 
responsibility: discovering connections and exploiting unique moments&mdash;and 
internalizing such decisions so as to be able to respond freely to the 
particularities of a given performance, the energy of an audience, and the 
acoustics of a particular hall.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>[37] Contrary to widely-held perceptions of Babbitt&rsquo;s music as cold and inexpressive, 
we find expressive freedom in <i>Lonely Flute</i> in the interstices between 
pre-compositional structure and musical cross-references, between close 
observance of score directions and communication of improvisational effect, 
between &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; tp and metric structure and the rhythmic feel they produce as 
they emerge and recede from the surface.</p>
<p>[38] Contrary, too, to the stereotype of analysis as rigorous and performance as 
intuitive (as if the two are somehow in conflict), we hope to have demonstrated 
the parallel journeys that both of these disciplines undertake. While 
acknowledging their distinctiveness, our joint exploration of Babbitt&rsquo;s Lonely 
Flute has brought out (to us, at least!) the tensions of rigor and freedom 
inherent in both, and in the process, has illuminated that 
virtuosity&mdash;compositional and performative, apparent and hidden&mdash;so central to 
Babbitt&rsquo;s <i>None but the Lonely Flute.</i></p>

diversity,&rdquo; see pages 19&ndash;20, 33&ndash;34.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">The array is T5 of the array of<i> Joy of More Sextets.</i> As 
is usual with Babbitt&rsquo;s all-partition arrays, the three hexachordally-combinatorial 
lyne pairs exhaust the distinct mosaics for the segmental hexachord. See Mead, 
<i>Introduction, </i>34 for the term &ldquo;hyperaggregate.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">T6 preserves the array&rsquo;s hexachordal mosaics.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">In a few cases (measures 40, 145, 151), flutter tongues 
entering on tied notes perform the same function.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">We are grateful to Andrew Mead for illuminating this 
aspect of Babbitt&rsquo;s practice in a discussion during an early phase of our 
analysis.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">In early time-point works such as String Quartet 3 and 
<i>My Ends are My Beginnings, </i>the notated meter, which remains relatively constant, 
often corresponds to the array modulus and is frequently articulated at the 
work&rsquo;s opening. In later works such as <i>Lonely Flute</i> and <i>Soli e Duettini,</i> 
however, meters change frequently (including alterations such as 3/4 +1/16) and 
evade a close correspondence to the time-point grid. See Andrew Mead &ldquo;About 
<i>About Time</i>&rsquo;s Time: A Survey of Milton Babbitt&rsquo;s Recent Rhythmic Practice,&rdquo; 
<i>Perspectives of New Music</i> 25/1 (1987): 195, 227; and Mead, <i>Introduction,</i> 257.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Unlike Babbitt&rsquo;s early tp practice, subdivisions in 
Lonely Flute do fall on the 16th-note tp grid; sometimes even entire 
equal-duration strings consist of 16th or 8th notes. Furthermore, equal-duration 
strings often begin or end within held notes or rests, thus obscuring their 
boundaries. Time points themselves occasionally fall on or within rests (e.g., 
measure 39, measure 42).</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Joel Lester, &ldquo;Notated and Heard Meter,&rdquo; <i>Perspectives 
of New Music</i> 24/2 (1986): 116&ndash;128.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Commercial recordings include those by Dorothy Stone 
(for whom the work was written), New World Records 80456&ndash;2 (1994); and Rachel 
Rudich, Koch International Classics 7335.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">The earlier LH&rsquo;s refer to the motive more generally, 
as a large downwards leap to a repeated pitch.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">The soliloquy is bounded at its beginning by a rest 
and repetition of pc E&#x266d; across registers, and at its end by a <i>mf</i> F&ndash;B&#x266d; &ldquo;cadence.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">and only one other aggregate restricted to two 
contiguous dynamics (<i>mp / mf</i> ). That other tp aggregate also associates with a 
single-register pc aggregate.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Although there are other aggregates confined to a 
single register, they occur in the middle and low registers, and involve two 
lynes rather than one.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">The wide variation in pacing results from differences 
in basic durational units (dotted 16th versus dotted 32nd), and in frequency of 
articulation of these units: the climactic passage articulates its equal 
subdivisions only sporadically, while the later passage attacks almost every one 
of its equal subdivisions.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">Repeated tps and equal-duration strings do not
