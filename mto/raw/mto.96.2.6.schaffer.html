<p>
[1.1] Peter Castine&rsquo;s <i>Set Theory Objects: Abstractions for
Computer-Aided Analysis and Composition of Serial and Atonal Music</i>
(hereafter referred to as STO) actually represents several texts in
one.  From the author&rsquo;s straightforward discussion of set-theoretical
principles to his fascinating look into the process of developing a
powerful computer tool for assisting composers or theorists in the
manipulation of these set-theoretical operations, the book offers both
a broad and informative look into the complex world of
cross-disciplinary study in significantly different domains, while at
the same time suffering from the difficulties of trying to place two
hats on the same figurative hook.
<p>

[1.2] STO (essentially a reprint of Castine&rsquo;s Ph.D. Dissertation in
communications science and musicology from the Technical University
Berlin, 1994) is divided into six chapters with three additional
appendices covering several rather discrete, yet interlaced, topics.
The first and third chapters offer a rather brief, yet interesting,
overview of the myriad issues&mdash;both historic and current&mdash;that the
author dealt with in developing his computer project. The second
chapter offers a selectively-detailed overview of set-theoretical
concepts, enhanced by two appendices presenting a complete set-class
table and a compilation of formal definitions and theorems.  The last
three chapters present a rather detailed, yet incomplete, journey
through the actual process of conceptualizing, defining, refining, and
implementing a Macintosh-based computer program.  A final appendix
offers a limited set of programming definitions, primarily useful for
those &ldquo;hard-core&rdquo; programmers intent on understanding the most
fundamental underlying design principles of the project.
<p>

[1.3] While Castine is to be lauded for undertaking such a
multifaceted project, any real attempts on his part to integrate these
materials into a cohesive work appear to be absent.  As happens all
too frequently in many dissertations, Castine appears simply to have
avoided the issue by offering his reader a collection of six
relatively discrete chapters, which, upon closer examination, actually
divided rather cleanly into three rather self-contained groups. This
observation is not intended to diminish Castine&rsquo;s work, but finding
value from STO demands that the reader treat the work as two very
different texts, bound together for convenience under one cover. For
most readers their interest in the work most likely will lie in one or
the other of the two camps, relinquishing the composite text primarily
to those of us similarly involved in melding computer technology with
musical inquiry.
<p>

[1.4] Having said all this, a more substantial look at each of the
component chapters of the book clearly is in order.  I have chosen
here, however, not to present the discussion in chapter order, but
rather to base my discourse around chapters sharing related content.

<p id="Section2" style="text-align: center"><b>2. Group I: Introduction &amp; Overview (Chapters 1 and 3)</b></p>
<p>

[2.1] Castine, in his rather brief (six pages) introductory chapter,
begins interestingly enough by laying out quite clearly just what he
believes STO is not about.  He writes that, while &ldquo;it had been [his]
intention to include a &lsquo;critical evaluation&rsquo; of set theoretic methods
and their application to music analysis,&rdquo; as work on the project
progressed he became acutely aware that inclusion of such a discussion
&ldquo;would be of only marginal interest, since the usefulness of set
theory has been, frankly, discussed to death&rdquo; (p. 16).  Castine also
wants his readers to be very aware of his own self-imposed limits
regulating the design and function of his computer program when he
states that
<p>
<blockquote>
This [work does not represent] an attempt to create a program to
analyze music without human intervention.  Indeed, the fields of
computer science (in general) and artificial intelligence (in
particular) have made great strides [and computer programs
potentially] could produce interesting or even valuable results.
There are, however, several reasons why this path was not pursued.
<nobr>. . . </nobr>[One of these reasons is] aesthetic and philosophical: I am not
interested in trying to replace the human being in the musical
process; I am interested in giving him tools to allow him to
concentrate on his work while making the mechanics of that work
easier (p. 17).
</blockquote>
<p>

[2.2] The author is also concerned that we understand his intended
scope and limitations regarding the set-theoretical tools chosen for
integration into his work.  Castine&rsquo;s project was inspired almost
entirely by his desire to expand and enhance an earlier set of
computer programs, Contemporary Music Analysis Package (CMAP),
developed by Craig Harris and Alexander Brinkman (1987) for MS-DOS and
Unix-based computers.  While Castine states clearly that &ldquo;there are
significant differences between the work done by Brinkman and Harris
and mine, and in certain aspects my objectives have been diametrically
opposed to those originally presented in Harris&rsquo;s dissertation,&rdquo; he
specifically sets out to document the development of a program that
would &ldquo;provide (at least) the functionality, flexibility, and speed as
the original version of CMAP in a form that would be considerably
easier to use, that would be available to a far larger number of
musicians&rdquo; (p. 19).
<p>

[2.3] As part of his rationale for undertaking this project, Castine
sets out in chapter three to survey other such projects.  By
constraining himself, however, to those programs &ldquo;whose authors have
made an effort to disseminate their work beyond an immediate circle of
colleagues and students&rdquo; (p. 76), Castine severely restricts his survey
to less than a half-dozen programs, of which only CMAP is privileged
with any significant discussion.  Given Castine&rsquo;s belief, however,
that &ldquo;None of the programs available for Macintosh provide the
flexibility nor comprehensiveness of CMAP&rdquo; (p. 91), this shortcoming is
at least rationalized.

<p id="Section3" style="text-align: center"><b>3. Group II: The Computer Program (Chapters 4&ndash;6, Appendix C)</b></p>

<p>
[3.1] Castine&rsquo;s discussion of the development of his computer program
encompasses the largest portion of the book, spanning three chapters
totalling seventy pages.  It is perhaps most likely the fourth chapter
(Designing User-Oriented Software for Set Theory) from which the
reader will gain the most benefit.  Castine devotes over thirty pages
to exploring and detailing solutions for what many would consider the
most important aspect of any useful program: the user interface.  The
author is careful to consider such factors as the historical nature of
the problem, the target audience, the purposeful definition of
specific tasks, and the overall basic design of the user interface.
Castine&rsquo;s discussions are both thorough and insightful.  He clearly
knows his topic and has put a great deal of energy into creating
elegant and useful solutions for typical interface problems.  The
author&rsquo;s solution for this project is elegant and simple: he opts for
the use of an &ldquo;analytic scratchpad,&rdquo; a program window based on a
spreadsheet-like metaphor that offers a very powerful and simple way
to manage a constantly varying number of music objects (sets) linked
by any myriad number of different operational relationships.  Being
able to place sets into cells anywhere on the scratchpad, and then to
be able to apply various set-theoretical operation to either
individual sets or combination of sets, clearly allows for a wide
range of possible analytical paradigms and working methodologies.
Castine offers a solution somewhat analogous to a piece of scratch
paper with a built in analytical calculator that does not require the
user to push many buttons to make it work&mdash;the solution is so 
straightforward and basic as to have eluded any number of programmers for
quite some time.  This chapter definitely should be read and digested
by any programmer even thinking of undertaking such a project.
<p>

[3.2] The remaining two chapters, while offering some valuable
insights, do not really carry through the informational richness
presented in chapter four.  Chapter five does offer an interesting
triptych of the process of actually implementing the program.  In the
absence of any program code, or charts diagramming some of the basic
functionings and design considerations of the program, the materials
presented at best can offer little more than a taste of how this
undertaking unfolds at select points throughout the development
process.
<p>

[3.3] Chapter six details those things that Castine feels still need
to be done to enhance the functionality of his program.  In a way,
this section presents us with a good lesson in futility, as Castine is
so apt to show us&mdash;albeit inadvertently&mdash;as he begins to explore
possible avenues of future program enhancement.  Initially, Castine&rsquo;s
discussions draw value from their close proximity to the current
(i.e., completed) task.  Continued musings, however, quickly lead the
reader further from the core foundation of the program into a
potentially endless abyss.  Anyone of us might be able to sit and
speculate with a fair degree of fluency as to how this or that of a
particular program might be improved, but unbridled flirtations with
&ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenarios, while they may certainly entertain, will probably
offer nothing much new in the end.

<p id="Section4" style="text-align: center"><b>4. Group III: Set Theory And Serialism (Chapter 2, Appendices A&ndash;B)</b></p>

<p>
[4.1] Chapter two, at around fifty pages, weighs in as the second
major component of STO.  As a detailed discussion of set-theoretical
and serial principles, it is also at best only peripherally related to
the other materials of the book, yet it offers the reader perhaps one
of the better overviews of the topic&mdash;albeit a slightly myopic
one&mdash;that I am aware of.  The materials are not presented in any
formal pedagogical manner&mdash;Castine opts instead for a decidedly
historical perspective.  Instead, he presents the basic materials in a
concise and well organized descriptive manner.  Although Castine&rsquo;s
discussion is strongly based on the composite views of many theorists
and composers&mdash;such as those of Milton Babbitt, George Perle, Edward
Cone, David Lewin, and Peter Westergaard&mdash;particular attention is paid
to ideas expressed in three significant works published at the time of
his study: <i>The Structure of Atonal Music by Allen Forte</i> (1973),
<i>Basic Atonal Theory</i> by John Rahn (1980), and <i>Composition with
Pitch-Classes</i> by Robert Morris (1987), hereafter referred to as CPC.
Perhaps most importantly, Castine&rsquo;s discussion is specifically limited
(with a few exceptions) to those elements representing the core
materials imbedded in CMAP, a fairly comprehensive collection, yet one
with significant roots in the three works cited above.  Included in
this chapter are the following sections:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Pitches, Pitch Equivalence, and Pitch Classes
<li>Intervals, Interval Equivalence, and Interval Classes
<li>Ordered Sets, Unordered Sets, Rows, and Cycles
<li>Set Membership and Cardinality
<li>Twelve Tone Operations
<li>Properties of Unordered Sets
<li>Set Equivalence and Set Class
<li>Set Class Relations
<li>Segmentation, and Other Objections
</ul>
<p>

[4.2] Throughout these discussions, the author employs terminologies
and formalizations as promoted by Morris in CPC.  Specifically,
Castine feels that Morris&rsquo;s notational convention &ldquo;has the advantages
that it is as succinct and precise as any: it reflects most
contemporary developments in set theory; it adheres closely to
conventions used in mathematical set theory; and has found wide
acceptance&rdquo; (p. 23).
<p>

[4.3] Early in the chapter Castine promotes a notion that &ldquo;the reader
will find roughly equal attention paid to both analytical and
compositional aspects of set theory&rdquo; (p. 23); however, I found no real
evidence to support his claim.  For the most part, the various
discussions are presented clearly and without any sense of bias.  The
chapter contains several excellent charts, such as the one summarizing
basic set operations; and the text is abundantly supported with
historically informative footnotes.  Castine does occasionally make a
few problematic statements, such as regard to enharmonic spelling as
being &ldquo;in accord with standard conventions in atonal music&rdquo; (p. 25)
[italics are mine].  The chapter also contains a rather odd section on
&ldquo;dissonance&rdquo; in post-tonal music&mdash;a topic with no direct correlation to
traditional set theory as espoused here.  Essentially, Castine offers
no real insight on the topic except to conclude that &ldquo;a general theory
of dissonance (or musical tension) compatible with set theory is
lacking&rdquo; (p. 61).
<p>

[4.4] Two related appendices are also included.  Appendix A contains a
complete table for all sets of cardinalities one through twelve.  The
information is presented in tabular form and contains all the basic
information found in the original CMAP table for each entry: a Fortean
set name, prime form, z-relatedness, m-relatedness, interval-class
vector, invariance vector, and adjacent interval vector.  Perhaps more
valuable as a pedagogical aid is Appendix B, which contains a set of
formal definitions and theorems for all the topics covered in chapter
two.

<p id="Section5" style="text-align: center"><b>5. Conclusions</b></p>

<p>
[5.1] It needs to be expressed again that, to evaluate the
effectiveness and usefulness of this book, one needs to be able to see
beyond the dual nature of the work.  Clearly, the inclusion of two
distinctly different topics poses a number of organizational problems
that the author seems not to have been able to resolve effectively,
leaving a bit of a schizophrenic taste in the mouth of the reader.
Each part obviously is more successful by itself, yet the two halves
never really join forces.  On the other hand, when effectively
isolated from one another, the two primary topics each can be of much
greater value, particularly depending on individual readers&rsquo; needs and
interests.
<p>

[5.2] Perhaps most interesting to the larger theoretical audience is
Castine&rsquo;s lengthy discussion of set-theoretical issues.  He offers the
reader a sound, well-documented historical overview that is presented
in a clear and concise manner&mdash;yet, perhaps at times, a bit too
objectively, as topics such as Forte&rsquo;s K/Kh relationships are
typically presented with no discussion of the relative merits of such
notions.  And, readers must be aware of the CMAP bias driving
Castine&rsquo;s discussion, particularly noting the omission of many
relevant theoretical concepts such as Morris&rsquo;s work with contour-space
and pitch-space, or various other authors&rsquo; work with similarity
measures&mdash;all of these notions have been well established long before
the writing of this book.  Nonetheless, despite the problems and
omissions of the text, chapter two perhaps could be utilized quite
effectively as an introductory body of materials for a graduate-level
course in set theory, particularly in light of the excellent reference
materials presented in the appendices.  But, then again, what do we do
with the other five chapters?
<p>

[5.3] More problematic is the status of computer program itself.  All
of the wonderful and creative ideas notwithstanding, a well-conceived
interface married to a powerful set of analytical tools is of real
value only to the user of that program.  Unfortunately, much of
Castine&rsquo;s work exists only on paper.  What is coded and running lives
up to the promise of the prose, but is still too incomplete to fulfill
its real pledge of offering us a powerful and intuitive analytical
tool.  As with any large undertaking such as this, the path to success
is all too often fraught with worldly pitfalls and obligations.  Lest
I be blamed simply for casting the first stone, let me first express
my sincerest hope that the programming efforts already begun will
eventually see the light of day.  I have witnessed the beginnings and
know that we will all benefit greatly when the end finally comes.</p>
