<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The ability to translate rhythmic notation into 
sound, and
conversely, to translate sound into notation, is an essential skill
that all musicians must master. The study of rhythm is a significant
component of many music theory and musicianship programs. Pedagogical
materials designed to help students to internalize rhythmic gestures
and make immediate connections to notation take a variety of
forms. Many sight-singing manuals, such as those by 
Robert Ottman,
Samuel Adler, Arnold Fish and Norman Lloyd, and Paul Hindemith,
contain graduated rhythmic exercises interspersed with melodic
materials.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Other texts, notably 
those by Anne Hall, Robert Starer,
and the text in question, are devoted exclusively to rhythmic
pedagogy.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> By isolating rhythmic 
issues, these authors approach the
topic more rigorously, and address a variety of musical issues that
are neglected in those texts that address rhythm as one component
among many.</p>

<p>[2] Readers familiar with the original edition of 
<i>Rhythm Reading</i>,
published in 1989 by Mayfield Publishing Company, will find the new
version superior in every way. The second edition offers a thorough
revision, featuring improved pedagogy, a better sequence of exercises,
more material for practice and in-class use, and more strategies for
the student to achieve success in performing the exercises. In
addition, the production value of this book is outstanding. The errors
of musical typesetting that plague many musical textbooks are kept to
a minimum in this volume, and the attractive page layout is very easy
to read.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The attractive typography 
and layout are far superior to
the earlier edition, and to the Starer or Hall texts.
</p>

<p>[3] <i>Rhythm Reading</i> is organized in four large sections. Unit I,
Fundamental Rhythm Patterns, comprises roughly one half of the text,
and presents &ldquo;patterns that occur most frequently in Western music.&rdquo;
Unit II, Irregular Division of the Beat, presents &ldquo;simple-meter
exercises that use triplets and sextuplets and compound-meter
exercises that use duplets and quadruplets. Quintuplets and septuplets
are introduced in both meters.&rdquo; Unit III addresses issues of
syncopation, and Unit IV presents excerpts from the literature.</p>

<p>[4] Of the three texts devoted exclusively to rhythm, <i>Rhythm 
Reading</i>
is alone in its inclusion of excerpts from musical literature. These
examples represent a wide range of musical styles, including folk
songs from several cultures, passages from European classical music
ranging from the fourteenth century to the present, and several
compositions by north and south American composers. This direct
connection with music as students experience it is one of the great
strengths of <i>Rhythm Reading</i>. Students are encouraged to recognize
rhythm as one musical component among many, and to place rhythm in a
larger context of performance or aesthetic judgment. Further, the
excerpts engage the visual problem of reading rhythmic patterns as
they appear on a five-line staff, in the context that they deal with
most often. Unfortunately, the relegation of these examples to the
final chapters of the text compromises the usefulness of the
excerpts. The excerpts, many of which are superb examples of the
rhythmic procedures introduced in earlier sections of the text, would
serve their purpose far better if they were integrated with the body
of exercises in the first 180 pages.</p>

<p>[5] The entire section of musical excerpts could be supplemented
effectively with several longer excerpts from the literature, both
single lines and duets or larger ensembles. These excerpts can be used
for a variety of purposes: to develop ensemble precision, to reinforce
conducting issues, to point out various compositional devices, and to
show how pitch considerations can influence rhythm in a compositional
contexts. Further, longer excerpts are necessary to discuss issues of
phrase rhythm and hypermeter, topics introduced by the author in
Chapter 5. Instructors who use longer examples as supplementary
material should also strive to find different editions and publishing
styles, as these can present different visual challenges to the
students. As a single example, one need only consider the visual
problems of reading various editions that utilize the &ldquo;backwards
eighth rest&rdquo; to represent a quarter rest. A diversity of genres and
historical styles can also provide material for discussion of rhythmic
performance issues that are dependent on stylistic considerations
(Baroque overdotting, ornamentation in a variety of styles, &ldquo;swing&rdquo;
eighth notes, etc.).</p>

<p>[6] The author&rsquo;s composed exercises, which comprise the bulk of
material in the text, appear in a variety of tempi, and include
single-line exercises, two-part exercises designed for one performer,
and two- and three-part exercises designed for class ensemble
performance. Tempi are indicated by standard Italian terminology
(Starer&rsquo;s exercises do not indicate tempo; Hall combines terminology
with suggested metronome markings). Most of the exercises also include
a expression and dynamic indications, requiring the students to
perform the exercises musically. I believe that the exercises could
include even more expression markings, such as a greater variety of
tempo markings in a different languages, as well as tempo
modifications and fermati. A creative instructor could introduce such
markings into some of the exercises, or one student could conduct
another&rsquo;s performance and &ldquo;cue&rdquo; various tempo modifications and
dynamic changes. The ensemble exercises are particularly interesting
and well conceived, introducing a variety of compositional procedures
such as augmentation/diminution canon, variation techniques, and
hocket.</p>

<p>[7] The exercises are organized within each section from simple to
more complex performance problems, and a spiral learning approach
based on individual rhythmic cells is espoused. The consistent use of
rhythmic cells and the clearly ordered presentation will appeal to
many instructors, and the variety of suggestions for performance in
the introductory sections can be used to create an interesting
classroom approach to the material. Further, new cells are derived
from earlier ones in a way that makes visual and aural sense to the
student. The author is particularly successful in treating &ldquo;homonym&rdquo;
rhythms (cells that look different but sound the same). Hall and
Starer are much less successful on this topic&mdash;both tend to rely on
a single favored notation rather than showing a variety of correct
possibilities.</p>

<p>[8] <i>Rhythm Reading</i> presents a wealth of information about musical
notation, offering advice on correct choices between rhythms that look
different but sound the same, and warning the student about potential
errors of notation as new material is introduced. A number of
notational signs that appear regularly in music, but infrequently in
textbooks, such as those for repeating the contents of a measure,
multi-measure rests, or measured and unmeasured tremolo, are presented
clearly within the text and the exercises. The pedagogical suggestions
typically refer to actual pieces, and they often point out fascinating
issues that are neglected by most of the other texts available. A
student working through this text chronologically with the guidance of
a teacher should be able to negotiate most of the exercises
successfully. The material is ordered very carefully, and each
exercise is prepared by what has come before.</p>

<p>
[9] In the preface, the author states that the text is &ldquo;a
comprehensive study of the rhythm patterns students are likely to
encounter when playing, singing, conducting, teaching, composing, or
studying music.&rdquo; He also presents his pedagogical approach in this
preface, demonstrating a variety of methods by which the text can be
used. The use of rhythmic cells is presented as the primary
pedagogical tool of <i>Rhythm Reading</i>, and these cells are presented 
in
table format in Appendix B.</p>

<p>[10] According to the author, &ldquo;Students learn to read rhythm not as
individual notes but as groups of notes, which are presented in the
text as &ldquo;rhythm cells&rdquo; (page xvii). This observation provides one of the
great strengths of the book, but the reliance on cells as the
exclusive tool for presenting a pedagogy of rhythm creates severe
limitations. By placing emphasis on individual patterns, it is easy
for the student and teacher to lose sight of larger issues of
phrasing, or the motion of rhythmic patterns in time. In addition, the
flexibility of accent and phrasing that is characteristic of musical
interpretation and performance at a high level cannot be achieved
through this approach. For much of the text, Kazez places a strong
emphasis on accent that supports the notated meter signature, putting
off all discussion of syncopation until the third unit. This late
presentation of syncopation creates an artificial atmosphere that is
separated from the world of music that students find in their lessons,
ensemble experiences, and lives.</p>

<p>[11] The other pedagogical tool espoused in this text is the use of
speech cues to learn new rhythmic cells (i.e., the student says
&ldquo;Beethoven&rdquo; in a triplet rhythm). The success of this approach would
probably vary considerably depending on the commitment of the
individual instructor and the character of the class. Of greater
concern is the inherent limitation of speech cues: they lock the cell
into a particular accent pattern, thus rendering cross-rhythms more
difficult to perform. I recommend, along with Kazez, that speech cues
be used only to introduce a new pattern, and that they be dispensed
with as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[12] The pedagogy is less successful in the later sections of the
book. A close examination of Chapter 9, on irregular divisions in
simple meter, reveals that the instructor using this text will need to
provide large amounts of supplementary material to insure that the
students will be able to perform the exercises successfully. The
chapter begins with a clear discussion of irregular divisions of the
beat in simple meter, and a chart of various beat divisions in simple
duple time is presented on page 111. Kazez further presents some short
examples from Ravel and Stravinsky to indicate the variety of
notations a student will encounter for these rhythms, even within the
same work. He advises the student of the need for flexibility in
approaching irregular divisions, due to the inconsistency of approach
taken by composers and publishers. He then states that &ldquo;In the
exercises below, the single most common and correct notation is used.&rdquo;
This limitation completely undoes the excellent preceding
discussion. While I do not advocate presenting <i>incorrectly</i> notated
exercises for the student&rsquo;s frustration, it seems that students need
to recognize a variety of correct notations. To limit the text to one
of several correct notations does not meet the stated goals of the
text, to present a &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; approach to the rhythmic patterns
students encounter in music.</p>

<p>[13] The one-part exercises in this section proceed in the order
triplet, quintuplet, sextuplet, and septuplet. This ordering is
somewhat puzzling, as sextuplets are clearly related both to triplets
and to traditional duple division of the beat, while quintuplets and
septuplets present a far higher level of complexity and performance
difficulty. Unlike earlier sections of the book, there are minimal
suggestions for successful performance of these new rhythms, and their
derivations, when relevant, are not built into the preparatory
exercises. For example, the introduction of triplets here provides a
clear opportunity to introduce changes of meter from simple to
compound in which the beat value stays constant. In addition, while
Kazez tells the student that triplets in simple meter are &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo;
from compound meter, he does not show how sextuplet sixteenth notes
can act as the bridge between duple and triplet eighths at this stage,
and when he does make the connection two pages later, he limits the
accentuation of the sextuplet to the non-syncopated version. This is
understandable, given that the ordering of the text addresses
syncopation of all types in Unit III, but the issue is not returned to
at that point.</p>

<p>[14] None of the exercises in Unit II presents any further elaboration
of the irregular subdivisions (for instance, rests within a tuplet
figure, or unequal values within the tuplet figure). For examples of
how this could be done, I recommend that the reader examine Hall&rsquo;s
<i>Studying Rhythm</i>, chapters 12 and 26, or, for a more rigorous
presentation, Starer&rsquo;s<i>Rhythmic Training</i>, chapters 5ff. Many of
these more complicated tuplet figures appear in the musical examples
found later in Kazez&rsquo;s text (see, for instance, Exercises 422, 425,
428, 431, and 435.) Students who have completed all of the exercises
in the first three Units of the text are not prepared when confronted
with these patterns. Had the examples been integrated into the body of
the text, as suggested above, it seems more likely that these
pedagogical shortcomings would have been noticed and addressed.</p>

<p>
[15] <i>Rhythm Reading</i> attempts to introduce 
students to larger issues
of metric organization from the earliest sections of the
text. Students are taught to conduct fast exercises &ldquo;in one,&rdquo; and
hypermeter is introduced on page 74. These often neglected topics are
crucial to a musician&rsquo;s understanding of musical phrasing, and the
author is to be applauded for including them in his text. Classroom
instructors should expand on these introductions to the topics by
bringing in supplementary materials and relating the concepts to those
presented in harmony and analysis courses. Since hypermeter and phrase
rhythm are defined in terms of specific features of harmonic analysis
and the rate of harmonic change,<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> it 
is impossible for this text to
do more than introduce the ideas of larger rhythmic organization, and
longer, more interesting examples of the flexibility of hypermeter and
phrase rhythm would require lengthy digressions into pitch-related
topics. I firmly believe that these digressions should be undertaken
by the classroom instructor. As it stands, the introduction to the
concept is sufficient within the scope of this text, although Kazez&rsquo;s
examples of hypermetric organization need to be longer for the concept
to make sense to the student aurally: a four-measure passage is not
enough music to represent four-bar hypermeter, any more than a single
measure in common time is enough to represent the meaning of common
time.</p>

<p>[16] In sum, the attractive layout, generally clear presentation, and
wealth of material unavailable in competitive texts makes <i>Rhythm
Reading</i>worthy of consideration for training musicians in the basics
of rhythmic performance and notation. However, the inconsistencies of
approach and organization in the later portions of the book will
require significant supplementary work by the instructor who adopts
this text for a complete sequence of rhythmic training.</p>
