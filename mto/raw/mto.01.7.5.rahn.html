<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Held every fourth summer since 1993, this summer&rsquo;s Symposium on Neo-Riemannian 
Theory remained true to its tradition as a &ldquo;working group.&rdquo; In particular, the Organizing 
Committee (David Clampitt, John Clough, Chair, Richard Cohn, and Jack Douthett) 
arranged for the papers to be distributed ahead of time among the presenters. As 
well, the scheduling of three successive non-parallel sessions followed by a fourth 
in which Richard Cohn responded to papers in the third session and David Clampitt 
moderated a discussion of the entire symposium by all participants ensured that 
colloquy was as intense and focused as possible throughout the meeting. </p>
<p>[2] The Symposium opened with <u>Julian (Jay) Hooks</u>&rsquo; &ldquo;Thirteen Ways of Looking 
at the Schritt/Wechsel Group,&rdquo; a survey of terms and mathematical notations that 
have been used to describe the Riemannian group of 24 triadic transformations (<i>R</i>) 
which involve, respectively, no change of &ldquo;mode,&rdquo; i.e., between major and minor 
triads (<i>R+</i>), and change of mode (<i>R-</i>). Cast within John Clough&rsquo;s suggested 
larger framework of the group <i>Q</i>, which comprises not only Hooks&rsquo; UTTs (Unified 
Triadic Transformations) but also inversions (T/I), Hooks&rsquo; report also dealt with 
recent cognate studies of non-triadic structures. In particular, Hook pointed out 
that voice-leading properties are not intrinsic to the shared group structure of 
triad and seventh-chord transformations, and that the combination of transposition, 
T<sub>n</sub>, and contextual inversion, <i>J</i>, which Lewin has applied to Stockhausen&rsquo;s
<i>Klavierstücke III</i>, can be replaced by a single, simply transitive group, 
K12 (1,6), or even by the S/W group. </p>
<p>[3] <u>Jack Douthett</u>&rsquo;s &ldquo;4-Systems in Webern&rsquo;s <i>Concerto</i>, Op. 24&rdquo; provided 
the Symposium&rsquo;s most detailed analysis of a serial work. Re-casting the usual trichord/hexachord 
approach to this piece in terms of Hook&rsquo;s UTTs and simply transitive groups, Douthett 
defined &ldquo;orbits&rdquo; of a cyclic group of order 4, which result in GISs (Generalized 
Interval Systems), specifically 4-systems, analogous to Richard Cohn&rsquo;s hexatonic 
and octatonic systems, as well as &ldquo;blocks&rdquo; that give rise to other GISs, in this 
instance &ldquo;supersystems&rdquo; of 4-, 6-, and 8-systems, analogous to Cohn&rsquo;s hyper-hexatonic 
and hyper-octatonic systems. </p>
<p>[4] <u>Scott Murphy</u>&rsquo;s study of &ldquo;Some Intersections between Neo-Riemannian 
Theory and Graph Theory&rdquo; formulated neo-Riemannian networks as instances of graphs 
or what he terms GRSs (Generalized Relational Systems), which are a kind of GIS 
where int(a,b) = int(b,a) and the set IVLS has only two members, related and unrelated. 
(Other cases he cited include interval cycles, row partitions, and most equivalence 
relations.) In general, such graphs can be presented analytically or realized compositionally 
in several ways. (E.g., all three components of a graph G&lt;S,R&gt; are determined by 
any two components, i.e., in any of three ways: G,S; G,R; S,R). Accordingly, Murphy 
focused on comparing and evaluating such alternatives. Emblematic of the oppositions 
Murphy explored are maximally smooth cycles versus the over-determined triad on 
one hand, and on the other, Childs&rsquo; [0258] network and a region of Murphy&rsquo;s typology 
where there are no GRSs. </p>
<p>[5] <u>Eytan Agmon</u>&rsquo;s account of &ldquo;The Multiplicative Norm and its Implications 
for Set-Class Theory&rdquo; problematized the often conflated concepts of equivalence 
and relatedness among pitch and pitch-class sets and intervals. Introducing the 
notions of &ldquo;transpo-inversional&rdquo; relatedness and a &ldquo;normed interval/distance system,&rdquo; 
Agmon advanced definitions, propositions, lemmas and theorems to prove that transposition 
preserves intervals, but inversion does not, and that T/I equivalence, though often 
valid analytically, is ad hoc in all GISs other than the normed interval/distance 
system. Agmon&rsquo;s concluding illustration showed that how the opening three melody 
tones of Schoenberg&rsquo;s Op. 11/1 are connected with other sets of tones in the first 
10 measures not through T/I equivalence, but rather via both pitch and pitch-class 
set equivalence, transpositional equivalence, inversional relatedness (as distinguished 
from equivalence!), and pitch-set distance-equivalence. </p>
<p>[6] <u>Jonathan Kochavi</u>&rsquo;s treatment of &ldquo;Parsimony and Contextuality of Diatonic 
Sequences&rdquo; first developed a calculus for comparing parsimony in various progressions 
(between sets of equal cardinality), where degrees of parsimony are determined by 
the number of common tones and the minimum total number of units (mod n) between 
their registrally respective members (e.g., 0 3 6 and 0 6 9 would have 2 common 
tones and a &ldquo;total voice-leading displacement&rdquo; or &ldquo;VL-shift&rdquo; of 6 = 0+3+3, or comparing 
0 3 6 and 0 9 6, 6 = 0+6+0: an undecided distinction in Kochavi&rsquo;s formulation, which 
allows registral &ldquo;voice-crossing&rdquo;). After advancing the theorems that any set forms 
with its transposition up x units not only the same number of common tones but also 
the same VL-shift as with its transposition down x units (e.g., 047 as compared 
with L27 and 059, and that within a mod-7 system, progressions involving the usual 
triads and seventh chords result in the same numbers of common tones and the same 
VL-shifts (e.g., 024 vs 025 and 624all mod 7). Kochavi went on to formulate a &ldquo;sequence 
succession operator&rdquo; to deal with progressions comprising interlaced sequences of 
sub-progressions, illustrating the correspondence between, e.g., <u>C</u> A <u>D</u> 
B <u>E</u> 
 <u>C</u> and <u>C</u> F <u>D</u> G <u>E</u> 
<u>C</u> in mm. 214-21 
and 254-58 of the Gloria in Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>Mass in C</i>. </p>
<p>[7] <u>Ramon Satyendra</u> began the second session with &ldquo;A Tonal <i>and</i> 
Hexatonic Sonata Form: Shostakovich&rsquo;s <i>Piano Sonata No. 2</i> in B Minor, I,&rdquo; 
positing a &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; of the opening B-minor and E-flat major themes in the recapitulation, 
in so far as their simultaneous combination completes the hexatonic collection (014589). 
Understanding the Bm and EbM chords not only as salient foreground features that 
function as linear connectives between tonal structures but also as upper structures 
in their own right, Satyendra emphasized in his explicitly eclectic analysis the 
primacy of well-formed (tonal) middleground counterpoint in contrast to the &ldquo;consistent,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;unifying,&rdquo; &ldquo;dissonant coloration&rdquo; of the polar triads. </p>
<p>[8] <u>Amy Shimbo</u>&rsquo;s discussion of &ldquo;Some Transformations between Triads and 
Seventh Chords&rdquo; focused on three &ldquo;split functions&rdquo; between a major or minor triad 
(037) and a half-diminished or dominant seventh. In each, there are two common tones: 
0368, T137, 0359. Surveying the recent literature on such progressions, Shimbo also 
drew attention to Ziehn&rsquo;s 1912 account of &ldquo;symmetrical inversion&rdquo; and a related 
passage in Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <i>Pathétique</i> recently analyzed by Yellin and further 
illustrated her typology by the first 11 measures of the <i>Liebestod</i>. Acknowledging 
that if fully diminished and minor sevenths were included, her typology would specify 
the same split relation between a particular common chord and three seventh chords 
(e.g., above, not only T137, but also 0369 and 0358), Shimbo conjectured that &ldquo;the 
solution might be as simple as defining different varieties of transformation depending 
on the chords being exchanged.&rdquo; </p>
<p>[9] Franck&rsquo;s <i>Piano Quintet in F minor</i>, I, mm. 26-37 and 90-102 served 
as the main illustration for <u>Robert Cook</u>&rsquo;s consideration of &ldquo;Parsimony and 
Extravagance&rdquo;: any transformations comprising, respectively, two common tones, and 
three voices each moving a semitone. These provided the starting-point for Cook&rsquo;s 
reflections on the interplay between naming transformations in response to the immediate 
experience of listening and the construction and generalization of formal models.
</p>
<p>[10] <u>Stephen C. Brown</u>&rsquo;s account of &ldquo;The Interaction of Ic1 and Ic5 in 
Twentieth-Century Music&rdquo; focused on one of the 15 possible dual interval spaces 
considered in his 1999 dissertation, namely, a space where there are dimensions 
for ic1 and ic5. Illustrating his talk with passages from Webern&rsquo;s Op. 5/4, Shostakovich&rsquo;s
<i>Sonata for Viola and Piano</i>, &ldquo;Clashing Sounds&rdquo; from Bartók&rsquo;s <i>Mikrokosmos</i>, 
and Ruggles&rsquo; <i>Evocations</i> no. 4, Brown paid special attention to the operation 
of &ldquo;interval exchange,&rdquo; which flips pc&rsquo;s around an ic1/ic5 axis. Although his analyses 
emphasized linear progressions through one or both dimensions, Brown also noted 
gaps in such processes. </p>
<p>[11] <u>John Clough</u>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trichords and Transformations in Two Pieces from Gyorgy 
Kurtag&rsquo;s <i>Kafka-Fragments</i>&rdquo; considered &ldquo;Penetrant Judisch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die Guten gehn 
im gleichen Schritt,&rdquo; as well as the <i>Quintetto per Fiati</i>, Op. 2/V, from the 
perspective of the neo-Riemannian transformations L, R, and P on 014 and the diatonic 
sets 037 and 025. Clough concluded by proving that for each of the 12 possible Wechsels, 
there are 55 distinct sequences of 3 Wechsels that correspond to it (if pairs are 
considered equivalent under reflection). </p>
<p>[12] The third session began with a joint presentation by <u>Fred Lerdahl</u> 
and <u>Carol Krumhansl</u> of &ldquo;Modeling Tonal Tension and Attraction in Chromatic 
Contexts.&rdquo; They construed tonal tension and relaxation in terms of harmonic motion 
to and from the tonic, and to and from near or distant chords, whereas, for example, 
tonal attraction to the tonic is high in the leading tone, and tonal attraction 
to the leading tone low in the tonic. Lerdahl&rsquo;s forthcoming book <i>Tonal Pitch 
Space</i> models these relations according to a multi-dimensional scaling in integers. 
E.g., chord distance is measured by numbers of 3-degree transpositions (mod 7), 
and distances between diatonic collections by numbers of 5-semitone transpositions 
(mod 12). Such chords are located on toroidal surfaces comprising not only the usual 
neo-Riemannian functions but also triadic/octatonic and triadic/hexatonic configurations. 
Other tension values are weighted without such spatial modeling: e.g., if there 
is a non-harmonic tone, add 1 if it is a seventh; otherwise, add 3 if diatonic, 
and 4 if chromatic. Melodic, voice-leading, and harmonic attraction are quantified 
by means of sums, products and ratios, and chord grammar, expressed in generative 
trees, cross-cuts all these distinctions. </p>
<p>[13] Krumhansl&rsquo;s experimental report focused on the results of comparing components 
of Lerdahl&rsquo;s quantitative models in various combinations with listeners&rsquo; tension 
responses. The latter involved moving a mouse horizontally on a computer screen. 
For diatonic and chromatic versions of the Grail theme from <i>Parsifal</i>, and 
mm. 1-6 and 7-12 of Messiaen&rsquo;s <i>Quartet for the End of Time</i>, V, correlations 
between models and listeners&rsquo; responses were uniformly quite high: R<sup>2</sup> 
ranged from 0.66 to 0.99, depending on which components of the models were combined. 
The quantitative scaling results were presented not only statistically but also 
graphically, the latter by means of color gradations in a two-dimensional display. 
After the formal presentation, Krumhansl demonstrated how the quantitative models 
and the subjects&rsquo; responses can be compared moment-to-moment in a pair of constantly 
shifting, real-time displays on a single PC monitor. </p>
<p>[14] Reporting &ldquo;On Riemann&rsquo;s Theories of Dissonance as a Resource for Analysis,&rdquo;
<u>Edward (Ed) Gollin</u> explored an aspect of Riemann&rsquo;s <i>Skizze</i> that has 
been largely neglected in favor of his Schritt-Wechsel system. In analyzing the 
rondo theme of the Forlane from Ravel&rsquo;s <i>Tombeau de Couperin</i>, Gollin favoredas 
arguably Riemann might havean interpretation of the recurrent 0148 sonority in 
terms of functional (e.g., subdominant and submediant) &ldquo;transpositions&rdquo; and chromatic 
alteration of chord tones (cf. 0159). In a similarly &ldquo;traditional, tonal&rdquo; vein, 
Gollin interpreted particular sonorities at the beginning of William Grant Still&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Cloud Cradles&rdquo; in terms of W3 and W7 transformations (e.g., 03478L as 047&lt;-&gt;L38 
and 0347 as 037&lt;-&gt;047). </p>
<p>[15] In &ldquo;Functional Fishing with Tonnetz: Toward a Grammar of Transformations 
and Progressions,&rdquo; <u>Charles Smith</u> argued that nineteenth-century music is 
best understood in terms of chord progressions comprising tonic, dominant and dominant-preparation 
functions, within the framework of a two-dimensional triadic Tonnetz. Illustrating 
particular progressions by excerpts ranging from Beethoven to Rachmaninoff and Errol 
Garner, Smith claimed, for example, that the dominant function depends solely on 
the leading tone&rsquo;s inclusion in a chord (e.g., V, V7, bvi, vii, and iii (with the 
possibility that a iii triad might be considered to serve a tonic function); a half-diminished 
chord is a minor triad with the usual seventh as root and vice versa; and bIIb7 
is a dominant, whereas bII is a dominant preparation. </p>
<p>[16] <u>Daniel Harrison</u> concluded the final session with &ldquo;Two Short Essays 
on Neo-Riemannian Theory.&rdquo; In &ldquo;The New Riemann: Same as the Old Riemann?&rdquo; Harrison 
critiqued the notion of transformation in terms of such oppositions as being-becoming, 
subject-object, and dynamic-static. In &ldquo;Some Hypotheses about Tonic and Antitonic 
Trichords,&rdquo; he advanced the view that 026 comprises three kinds of discharge function 
(e.g., FGB of G7 resolving to C, E, or Ab). These he described as &ldquo;antitonic&rdquo; rather 
than dominant because, in each, two tones serve a dominant function (G-G, B-C; G/Fx-G#, 
B-B; G-Ab, B-C) and one a subdominant function (F-E; F-E; F-Eb). Citing theorists 
from Rameau to Persichetti and Ulehla, Harrison explored progressions among antitonic 
trichords and their resolutions, favoring a view in which, e.g., whole-tone subsets 
are understood as dynamic rather than static.</p>
