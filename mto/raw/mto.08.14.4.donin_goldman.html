<h3 align="center"><a name="section1">I. On the  Relevance of Paradigmatic Analysis Today</a></h3>
<p>[1] What could a contemporary  practice of paradigmatic analysis look like? Although certainly not practiced  in the way or to the extent that Nicolas Ruwet and Jean-Jacques Nattiez may  have predicted 40 years ago, linguistics-inspired analysis has surely not been  definitively relegated to the dustbin of the history of music theory, its past  proponents dismissed as fashion victims of short-lived French intellectual  trends. But where can we still find those famous charts, inspired by Claude  L&eacute;vi-Strauss&#8217;s analyses of myths, anticipated by the ethnomusicologist Gilbert Rouget, proposed by Ruwet and systematized by Nattiez, which map out synchronic  similarities by placing fragments of scores into columns?<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Interest in this mode of analysis probably attained a zenith around 1982, the year that the journal 
<i>Music Analysis</i>, then edited by Jonathan Dunsby, devoted one of  its very first issues to an  English translation of Jean-Jacques Nattiez&#8217;s ninety-seven page analysis of  Edgard Var&egrave;se&#8217;s <i>Density 21.5</i> (1982).  Twenty-five years later, recent literature seems to suggest that two distinct  groups of researchers remain interested in paradigmatic methods:  ethnomusicologists and computer music researchers. On the one hand, ethnomusicologists,  particularly 
those of a more &#8220;structuralist&#8221; than &#8220;culturalist&#8221; bent, such as  the members of Simha Arom&#8217;s team at LACITO in France,<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> do indeed practice paradigmatic analysis (henceforth PA). However, since these  researchers study music of oral tradition, they must necessarily modify PA to a  score-less context. As such, they go beyond the bounds of Nattiez&#8217;s original  project, since he was dealing principally with notated score-based music. On the other hand, computer music specialists, interested in melodic  contour detection with a view towards information retrieval or musical  similarity measures,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>			and only secondarily in semiotics, sometimes give a ritual nod to the  pioneering work of Ruwet et al, while rarely inscribing their work within a  semiotic or analytic program.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>			There remains a significant dearth of paradigmatic approaches among the  mainstream of music analysts and theorists today, who were, after all, the  target group of Nattiez&#8217;s work.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>			What accounts for this scarcity? In order to attempt an answer, it is  worthwhile to examine some of the principles underpinning PA, its  methodological assumptions, and the ways it was approached by its original  practitioners.</p>
<p>[2] Recall that Paradigmatic  Analysis is a tabular representation of a musical work 
that arranges in  columns those elements of a score which are considered identical with respect  to some condition. In a PA, the music can be followed chronologically by  reading from left to right and top to bottom as in an ordinary score, with the  understanding that verticalities correspond to recurrences of similar elements. 
Already in the 1960s, pioneers of paradigmatic  analysis had their sights set on algorithm-like rules  able to be processed in principle by a computing machine 
that could generate  semiotic analyses. It is striking, however, that none of them pursued this goal  with any great fervor, even though their careers extended (and continue to  extend) well into the age of the personal computer. And yet this automatization  seems compatible with Nattiez&#8217;s goal of using paradigmatic analysis to constitute  groups of works 
that share stylistic traits revealed through PA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle of seriation [<i>mise en s&eacute;rie</i>] is, as a matter of fact,  the basis of the technique of automatic documentation which consists, for  example in the field of archeology, in making an inventory, without any a  priori criteria of relevance, the descriptive traits of monuments, and on the  basis of this neutral inventory, to find, with the goal of stylistic  characterization or something else, the traits common to several monuments (cf.  Gardin 1974).<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup>			</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, this  automatization seems incompatible with the goal of most music analyses, which  seek to account for the singularity of the musical work and/or the  comprehension of the analyst, and which even in the most formalized or  generative forms of analysis, always involve on-the-fly micro-decisions,  formulated during the heuristic process, which result from the inevitable  resistance of the material to abstract theoretical rules. </p>
<p>[3] It remains that students of  musical semiotics have often been left with the impression that the criteria of  automatizability are crucial to the project of PA. The problematic nature of the  assumption of &#8220;automatizability&#8221; in <i>principle</i> to paradigmatic operations may be in fact what led to this technological  impasse, which could account for the unjustifiable neglect into which  this analytical practice has fallen today. Nattiez needed to give more  emphasis to this assumption (the claim that PA offers fully explicit  rules of segmentation 
that could be performed by a hypothetical computer  poring over strings of note-symbols) than Ruwet did, in order to be able to  make PA  the centerpiece of his &#8220;tripartite&#8221; theory of the musical sign 
(with its poietic, neutral and esthesic levels): he  deems PA the very embodiment of &#8220;analysis of the neutral level,&#8221; the central (and most problematic) stage in the analytical schema 
that he borrows from Jean Molino.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>			As he writes, &#8220;We then use Ruwet&#8217;s initial proposal [i.e., PA] in a framework  (tripartition and stylistic analysis) which was never and is still not that of its author&#8221; (<a href="#nattiez_1975b" id="citation_nattiez_1975b_67dc9afe608ed">1975b</a>, 239). Once PA is assigned  the role of &#8220;analysis of the neutral level,&#8221; its objectivity and autonomy from  the musical decisions of the analyst become crucial to Nattiez&#8217;s semiotic  project. It is this problematic &#8220;neutrality&#8221; 
that has disturbed many of PA&#8217;s  critics, such as Jonathan Bernard who, in the pages of <i>Music  Analysis</i>, calls into question the supposed neutrality of the  author of a PA, and in particular, Nattiez&#8217;s famous study of <i>Density</i>. Bernard worries that the discovery procedures involved in  PA are only &#8220;superficially appearing to conduct their business in uninterpreted  fashion&#8221; and are actually concealing their original motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite [Nattiez&#8217;s] protestations to the contrary, then, he is really on  the same footing as every other analyst. His work has been difficult to  evaluate, however, because rather than admitting that the &#8220;inclinations&#8221; of his  descriptive tools represent certain fundamental assumptions&#8212;assumptions which  ought to be open to question, just as are other analysts&#8217; assumptions&#8212;he has  pretended to begin with properties of musical structure so universal that they  have the status of unchallengeable axioms (<a href="#bernard_1986" id="citation_bernard_1986_67dc9afe608f0">1986</a>, 209).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps possible to accept  Bernard&#8217;s objection while at the same time embracing a paradigmatic  perspective: to do this, we must accept that paradigmatic analysis is the  activity of a <i>situated</i> analyst who  uses historically and geographically determined musical understanding and  culture to make analytical decisions at every stage of the process&#8212;decisions  
that are laden with innumerable assumptions (some or all of which could  possibly be made fully explicit).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Furthermore, paradigmatic analysis need not restrict itself to the so-called  neutral level, but is itself a symbolic form 
that can be studied in terms of  its modes of production (poiesis) and perception (esthesis). This presupposes  an understanding of the situated character of analytic knowledge. </p>

	<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b>. Bifurcations in Nattiez's analysis of <i>Density 21.5</i> (1975<i>a</i>, in 1982, p. 248)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="donin_goldman_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="donin_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>
			[4] Of course, what allowed Jonathan  Bernard to indict Nattiez&#8217;s analysis so thoroughly was the fact that Nattiez is  intellectually honest enough to make explicit so many of the analytical  decisions 
			that go into his analysis of<i> Density</i>. 
Thus, the situated character of the analytical act becomes visible right from 
the start, even if this was not of course Nattiez&rsquo;s stated intention. In several 
			particularly revealing places, Nattiez refuses to decide between two 
			alternative interpretations of a single passage, one of which gives 
			pride of place to pitch, the other to rhythm. An analytical chart 
			usually obscures the fact that it is the result of a choice on the 
			part of the analyst, other interpretive options having been rejected 
			at an earlier stage of the activity of recomposition involved in its 
			fabrication. In contrast, Nattiez lays bare this very ambivalence. 
			This bifurcation leads Nattiez to invent categories that support 
			his analysis and give it its distinctiveness. In his analysis, he 
			assigns lower-case letters ([2a], [4b], etc.) to alternative paths 
			through the chart, as shown in <b>Example 1</b>.
<p>
  [5]
  As Nattiez notes, the opening of the piece &#8220;can be  seen, in fact, in two different ways (A and B), showing straight away that the  neutral level is not restricted to <i>one </i>manner  of presentation, but on the contrary displays the diverse configurations  possible, though without 
	professing to unite them all <nobr>. . .</nobr> The paradigmatic axis  regroups units 
	that are equivalent from a given point of view: this does not  mean that they are homogeneous&#8221; (Nattiez, 1975<i>a</i> in Eng. trans., <a href="#nattiez_1982" id="citation_nattiez_1982_67dc9afe609f5">1982</a>, 248). Alternative A represents an alignment of elements according to rhythmic similarities, while the B column aligns elements according to pitch identities. This bifurcation brings out the  distinction in a PA (or in any musical analysis) between <i>process</i> and <i>product</i>.  Rather than being asked to accept a definitively constituted chart, Nattiez, by  presenting an alternative, reminds us that the finished chart is the product of  a process, one 
	that moves back and forth between the work and the preliminary  results of analysis. With this bifurcation, Nattiez brings the analyst on-stage as it were, revealing his own &#8220;compositional process&#8221; by presenting, in  raw form, material 
	that resists tabulation into the paradigmatic chart. It  might even be said that PA, far from revealing automatizable rules of  segmentation, is effective in revealing <i>to  the analyst </i>the methodological assumptions that went into the analysis:  what categories or concepts were used. When Nicholas Cook, for example, finds  Nattiez&#8217;s list of characteristic features (which are used to determine the  paradigmatic headings) &#8220;curiously&nbsp;quirky&#8221; (<a href="#cook_1987" id="citation_cook_1987_67dc9afe60a05">Cook 1987</a>, 172)&#8212;that is,  that there is no universal feature list, but only particular ones made up for  each individual piece under analysis&#8212;his objection may not be fatal for the  enterprise of PA. The reason why Nattiez has a 
heterogeneous list of such  categories as &#8220;M1=one semitone down and two up,&#8221; &#8220;0=substitution of E<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/flat.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"></font>  for E<font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../gifs/natural.gif" width="7" height="18" align="texttop"></font>,&#8221; and &#8220;L=to-and-fro motion,&#8221; is that the analysis has allowed him  to reveal the cognitive categories 
	that have been guiding his analysis from  the start. The PA makes explicit categories of musical comprehension rather  than applying objective neutral criteria of segmentation. These categories were  clearly useful for Nattiez&#8217;s own way of &#8220;listening&#8221; to the work, and one of the  purposes of his analysis is surely to invite the reader to listen to the piece  in the same way. In this view, any musical analysis&#8212;and PA in particular&#8212;is a &#8220;signed&#8221;  listening&#8212;a way  for listeners (whether experts or amateurs) to qualify and describe what they  hear, in however informal a manner and however far removed from the &#8220;official&#8221;  interpretations of the work.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup>			Looking at Nattiez&#8217;s <i>Density</i> analysis, one is then struck by the fact that the <i>situated</i> character of the analysis is  revealing and interesting, rather than being an element of undesirable  subjectivity 
	that needs to be excised from a truly scientific analytical  project. </p>
<p align="left">[6] We have seen how Nattiez&#8217;s  analysis of <i>Density </i>allows us to  become aware of the role of the analyst himself, and the way he <i>performs</i> the musical culture to which he  belongs: not only writing texts, but also listening to the recording,  photocopying the score, cutting out portions of it, arranging them onto a  larger paper with balls of tape, etc. These seemingly anodyne material  operations turn out to be crucial to understanding this situated analytical  activity. Once the analyst is brought onto the stage of the analysis it is not long  before the role of the listener/reader of an analysis also becomes thematized.  We could then speak of an <i>esthesic</i> level of paradigmatic analysis: the activity of the chart-reading listener.  From this viewpoint, music analysis becomes a refined tool for listeners to be  able to formulate their relationship with the work: inspired by reading an  analysis, listeners are invited to borrow the author&#8217;s conceptual categories  and forms of musical comprehension the next time they listen to the work.

<p>
[7] A particularly eloquent example  of this situatedness, from outside the realm of PA, is Arnold Schoenberg&#8217;s  famous autoanalysis of the relationship between the two themes of his <i>Kammersymphonie</i>, op. 9 (<b>Example 2</b>). On  lines a) and b) appear two nearly literal transcriptions of the two themes. On  lines c) and f) Schoenberg re-writes these themes and lays the foundation of  his analysis by variously assigning large or small noteheads or by spacing the  notes with a view to bringing out a significant vertical relationship. Finally,  in the two intermediary lines, d) and e), he makes explicit the relationship of  inversion 
that he sees as holding between the two themes. Because Schoenberg is both the author of  this analysis and of the work analyzed, it is obvious that the extreme subjectivity of his interpretation does not render it worthless or uninteresting. This subjectivity is,  however, self-evident. After all, as has  often been asked, by what criteria did Schoenberg choose certain notes as being  important (the ones connected with lines), and relegate others to the status of  auxiliary tones? (cf. Preface to <a href="#schoenberg_1995" id="citation_schoenberg_1995_67dc9afe60a0e">Schoenberg 1995</a>, 36&ndash;39) To find the answer  to this question is to learn something about the way Schoenberg had come to <i>hear</i> his own work some 30 years after  having composed it. The composer was clearly expressing through his analysis an  id&eacute;e fixe 
that had once occurred to him, never to be forgotten. At the same  time, he found a way of expressing an analytical interpretation in tabular form  in such a way as to (successfully?) prescribe <i>our</i> listening. In other words, the situated character of the  analysis yields precious information. In fact, had Schoenberg formalized his  observation even further&#8212;for example by extracting a rule and then looking for  similar relationships in other pieces&#8212;he would not have diminished the  fundamentally subjective interpretation to which he submits his work, but he  would certainly have made it more accessible to the analytical community at  large. This property of communicability 
that an analysis can possess will be  revisited later on. </p>


<h3 align="center"><a name="section3">III. A Situated and Historically-Informed Design Process</a></h3>
<p>[8] Similarly, in dealing with PA  today, we cannot but be aware of the situated character of our own analytical  stances: our laptops extend our cognitive capacities and become the environment  upon which our intellectual activity is inscribed, and at the same time our  musicological <i>Weltanschauung</i> is  informed by a certain critical distance from the structuralist drive for  mathematization 
that was part of a general tendency in the humanities and  social sciences towards quantitative analyses of the formal logic underlying  the arts, language and all human experiences (epitomized in the  efforts of the members of Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss&rsquo;s <i>Laboratoire d&rsquo;anthropologie sociale </i>founded in 1960 at the <i>Coll&egrave;ge de France</i>; 
on the history of quantitative analysis in the humanities and social sciences, 
cf. <a href="#dosse_1997" id="citation_dosse_1997_67dc9afe60a10">Dosse 1997</a>). Our own research springs from  these starting points: to see if it is possible to create a software  environment for PA 
that allows analysts to perform all their usual activities  within its confines, while at the same time taking advantage of the specific  possibilities of the computer. </p>
<p>[9] The project presented here was  undertaken by the APM (Analysis of Musical 
Practices)<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>			research group at IRCAM in Paris. This research group carries out research  in the humanities into different musical practices, particularly those 
that  lie at the heart of IRCAM&#8217;s activities: composition, contemporary  music performance, attentive listening, and music analysis. In this context,  music theory is seen as both a central body of  methods with which   musical phenomena can be approached, and as a musical practice <i>per se </i>(a way to express one&#8217;s musicianship) 
that can itself  become an object of empirical study. One of APM&#8217;s focuses is the way musical  and audiovisual technologies can be used in the comprehension of musical facts  being studied by music analysis. To this end, APM has laid out a historical as  well as a technological program. On the one hand, it studies the techniques of  close listening as they were promoted at the end of the 19th century  in various types of listening guides, as well as their posterity in the work of  professional analysts of the 20th century; on the other hand, the  team works to develop hypermedia tools for music analysis 
that allow for the  inclusion of time-coded annotations into the analytical presentations, which  replace the traditional musical examples 
that one places in a text. This ties  in with other projects at this institution. For example, a software package  called Music Lab 2, which was a collaboration with the French Ministry of  Education,<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup>			included  Music Lab Annotation, a tool for synchronizing musical sound and image and  allowing a scanned score to be annotated in many ways, in order to produce any  of the following: a music analysis, a listening guide, or a &#8220;signed listening&#8221;  (see paragraph 4). The particular focus of the APM team explains why the Score  Charter project 
introduced in the following pages is the result of an unusual  admixture of historical and technological research. </p>
<p>[10] APM&rsquo;s &#8220;Mise en tableau/&eacute;coute segment&eacute;e&#8221; (&#8220;Charting the Score/Segmented Listening&#8221;) project, which gave rise to the prototype of the Score Charter tool discussed (and exploited in the application examples) in this paper, was a collaboration between musicologists Nicolas Donin and Jonathan Goldman and  software developers Thomas Bottini and Samuel Goldszmidt.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>			The conception and development of this project, whose most tangible result is  the score-charting computer tool for music analysis 
that is currently in a  functional&#8212;although far from final&#8212;form, took place in 2005&#8211;2006, and then  again in 2008. This team has followed a model of &#8220;collaborative design,&#8221; in which  designers (programmers) and users work in the same space and interact with each  other. This model of team cooperation involves specialists in very different  domains who work together at all stages of the tool&#8217;s development; the two  musicologists have a need 
that they wish the tool to address, without having  particular programming skills, while the two developers try to understand how  best to respond to this need and to explain the different design options at  their disposal to the musicologists without recommending any pre-conceived  software solutions. This working model can thus stimulate unconventional responses  to the needs of researchers, however counter-intuitive these approaches might  seem from the point of view of computer programming.   </p>
<p>[11] The initial idea to develop a software tool capable of performing  and presenting auditory paradigmatic analyses is then part of a larger research  project concerned with the history of analytical gestures. We became  particularly interested in the basic preliminary operations of musical  chart-making 
that would need to be recreated by the software tool: cutting up  the score into fragments, transcription/rewriting, joining fragments taken from  different lines, the need to alter the chart 
along the way or even to destroy  it. Other functionalities of the tool that were decided upon during the design  process were:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to  display temporal data related to fragments that had been divorced from their  contexts through the act of segmentation.</li>
  <li>The possibility  of assigning descriptive labels (semanticization) to the different fragments.</li>
  <li>The need to be able to set aside some elements  for short or longer time periods, because they do not fit into the analytical  viewpoint adopted at that precise moment. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It was decided early on that it would be useful to &#8220;sonorize&#8221; a  paradigmatic chart: to synchronize the score with a corresponding recording, in  order to be able to hear the fragments and to categorize them on the basis not  only of the visual appearance of the score, but also of its incarnation as  sound (which is of course absolutely essential when dealing with music for  prepared instruments or live electronics, in which score reading alone misses  critical musical information). We began by using the synchronization software  already designed for Music Lab Annotation, which allows the user to define the  placement of the systems, to place markers at junctures in the score, and by  tapping, to associate these markers to corresponding places in the sound file.  The segmentation is effected by hand, the analyst choosing the placement of the markers before the tool produces the chart. It is important to note that  the Score Charter produces charts according to a segmentation 
that the analyst chooses in the first stages of analysis, and does not attempt to automatically segment a score. A newer version of the Score Charter is being fitted with an internal function  for synchronizing score to sound, without recourse to MLA.</p>

<p>[12] A few words about the technical specifications of 
			the tool. The  Score Charter tool is developed in Flash ActionScript 2.0. It reads xml files  produced during the synchronization procedure in MLA, and also produces xml  files, which contain the instructions for producing the PAs from the  synchronized score. The Flash programming environment was chosen because it  allows for both offline and online tools to be developed, and is convenient for  manipulating multimedia data&#8212;images, sound files etc. Moreover, the widely-used  Flash player&#8212;with which most computers are equipped&#8212;recommends it as a means  for web publication of tool-based music analyses. The Score Charter reads  images in jpg format and sound in mp3 format of any bitrate. The xml files are  exceedingly small (less than 100Kb), and can be conveniently sent as email  attachments. They contain pointers towards the score images and the sound file.  These lightweight files make the transmission of these analyses convenient, so  that any potential reader who 
possesses the images of the score and the sound  file can access the PA once the xml file is received as an email attachment.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
			The structure of the tool can be represented as illustrated in 
			<b>Figure 1</b>.</p>

<div style="width:420px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
</div>

<p >[13] While the production of paradigmatic analyses was the primary goal,  we also wished the tool to be versatile enough to be able to display other  forms of charts 
			that involve fragments of scores, such as the D&#8217;Indy  tabulation of the Haydn variations shown in <b>Example 3</b> or a Leitmotive table.  Most importantly, we wanted to design a tool in which the reader of the  analysis could interact with the chart, and even alter it. This interaction, which tends to  blur the line between the <i>author</i> and the <i>reader</i> of the chart and  puts readers and analysts on potentially equal footing, is only possible in the  context of multimedia computer software. After all, a result in the form of a synoptic chart does not automatically give the  reader all the information necessary for the reconstruction of the chart from  the corpus being studied. In order to be able to submit an analytical  conclusion to critical discussion, it is necessary to have access to all of the  elements that gave rise to it, which in turn makes it possible to offer  bifurcations or alterations to the process, which yield other resulting charts. This can  be done effectively through some  level of interaction with the chart: comparing by ear the different segments  grouped together in the same row or column; modifying the appearance of the  chart on the page by changing the order of the lines and the columns or  simply the norms of presentation; lastly, it might be desirable to modify the segmentation 
			that gave  rise to the fragments which are the input of the chart, and then to re-order  the chart as a function of these decisions, which are retrospectively called  into question.</p>
  
<p>[14] The first thing that became apparent is that PA is a special case  of a more general practice of charting scores. A genealogical relationship ties Ruwet&#8217;s invention to the Wagnerian tradition of processing musical texts.  Indeed, Ruwet was inspired by L&eacute;vi-Strauss&#8217;s structural analyses of myths,  which were themselves inspired by the vertical simultaneities of musical scores.  L&eacute;vi-Strauss, whose childhood worship of the &#8220;God Wagner&#8221; (L&eacute;vi-Strauss, 1964,  p. 23) would have doubtless led him to become acquainted with the <i>Leitmotive</i> tables  found in the opera guides of the French  Wagnerian tradition, such as Albert Lavignac&#8217;s famous <i>Voyage artistique &agrave; Bayreuth</i> (<a href="#lavignac_1897" id="citation_lavignac_1897_67dc9afe60a36">1897</a>), would therefore have been familiar with the experience of  recomposing musical information from a score to a chart.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup>			In the field of French musical pedagogy, the workhorse  of musical institutions throughout the French-speaking world for nearly half a  century was the work of another Wagnerian: Vincent d&#8217;Indy&#8217;s <i>Cours de composition musicale </i>(<a href="#d&rsquo;indy_1909" id="citation_d&rsquo;indy_1909_67dc9afe60a39">1909</a>).  This composition manual abounds in tabular representations of analyses 
that  often take a form reminiscent (to us) of certain modern analytical gestures,  especially when d&#8217;Indy compares a theme with its variations in a movement from  a Haydn piano sonata (Hob XVI/49), and deduces an underlying Gestalt (which he  names the &#8220;<i>sch&egrave;me m&eacute;lodique</i>&#8221;; see Example 3). D&#8217;Indy&#8217;s juxtaposition of the variations&#8212;similar to some Schenkerian analyses, such as Schenker&#8217;s  reduction of Brahms&#8217;s Handel Variations (<a href="#schenker_2005" id="citation_schenker_2005_67dc9afe60a3b">Schenker 2005</a>, 81&#8211;83)&#8212;yields an output 
that in this  case is a kind of primordial melodic contour, which, by being placed along the  top of the chart, guides and induces a certain reading of the individual  variations. The presence of this &#8220;<i>sch&egrave;me m&eacute;lodique</i>&#8221; makes visually explicit  what d&#8217;Indy&#8217;s analysis later expresses in prose about the variation set: the  simple fact that something fundamental is common to all of them. D&#8217;Indy&#8217;s  innovation was to inscribe this common schema along the top of the table.  Similarly, in PA, the alignment of elements into columns implies a  supplementary concept: that which is common to all of the elements in the  column. In the case of PA, this may not be expressed as a transcendental  melodic schema, but either as an exemplary element, which amounts to what  Nattiez calls a &#8220;paradigmatic heading&#8221; (<i>t&ecirc;te  de paradigme</i>), or as a tight web of qualitative relationships&#8212;what Nattiez  sometimes terms a &#8220;paradigmatic theme.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>			</p>
<p>[15] In light of this brief contextualization, PA can not only be seen as a precursor of the automatizing ambitions of late 20th-century music information retrieval or computational musicology (cf. notes 3 and 4), but also as a structuralist reinvention of a tradition of listening 
that begins with the analytical practices which emerged among Wagnerian Europe at the end of the 19th century, notably with the production of Leitmotive tables.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>			(As a result, our project cannot but concern listening subjects, and subjective and psychological time, rather than the study of musical data divorced from listeners.) The intuition that structuralist musicology could be inscribed within a tradition of analytical techniques employed in earlier theoretical writings was noted by C&eacute;lestin Deli&egrave;ge in 1974, in the years that Nattiez was writing the first book-length overview of musical semiotics, his 
<i>Fondements</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nineteenth-century treatises (D&#8217;Indy, Riemann) already bear the first  traces of having sought a segmentation inspired by a concern for logic. In these  works, it is already the principle of well-labeled equivalencies which guided  these authors <nobr>. . .</nobr> In Sch&ouml;nberg, this taxonomy becomes even more precise on  account of his having founded his theory on the tradition of Viennese  classicism, and therefore, on the principle of variation of a basic cell  (<a href="#deli&egrave;ge_1974" id="citation_deli&egrave;ge_1974_67dc9afe60a46">Deli&egrave;ge 1974</a>, 32).</p>
</blockquote>
		

<p>In the context of this tradition of chart making, Ruwet&#8217;s innovation  seems to reside chiefly in a kind of open-endedness of the size and shape of  the chart: since new rows and columns are created based on criteria of similitude, the  dimensions of the chart only become fixed at the <i>end</i> of the analysis (cf. his famous analysis of the <i>Geisslerlied</i> shown in <b>Example 4</b>), rather  than at the beginning; in D&#8217;Indy&#8217;s more conventional table, the size and form of  the grid is predetermined during an analytical stage (i.e. a  culturally-informed segmentation of the phrases to be compared) 
that logically  
precedes the fabrication of the chart.</p>

<div style="width:480px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
</div>

<p>[16] Over and above the historical genealogy  of PA, what all of these charts have in common is the fact that they are  produced by the same material means: retranscription, cutting  into  fragments, juxtaposition of different musical segments, and so on. It is these tasks 
that we were  interested in emulating as on-screen operations. The tool&#8217;s representation of D&#8217;Indy&#8217;s  variation table will make this clear 
(see <b>Example 5</b>). This simple chart for comparison of  elements illustrates an important feature of the tool: superimposed segments  
that might not seem similar from a visual point of view (to a student, for  example), can be easily <i>heard </i>to be  similar. Of course, in a screenshot, used here instead of the application because of a problem in obtaining permissions for the recording used (that of Vladimir Horowitz), the fragments cannot be listened to. In the remaining examples in this article, the main features of the tool will be usable, and the reader will have the possibility of listening to different fragments as well as to entire rows and columns of elements.</p>

<h3 align="center">IV. <a name="section4">General Concepts of Interface&mdash;Analytical Illustrations</a></h3>
<p>[17] In [12] the technical specifications of the tool were discussed. In  the following paragraphs, we discuss the reasoning behind each of the elements  of the tool. It is worth repeating that this tool is meant to aid the analyst in the elaboration and presentation of his analytical processes, and not to compute analyses automatically in place of the user.</p>
<p>[18]<b> </b><i>Synchronization</i>: The  Music Lab Annotation (MLA) software contains a manual synchronization function.  In the first version of the Score Charter, image files of the score (comprised  of one or several pages) are made to correspond with an audio file using MLA.  In the most recent version of the tool, this synchronization apparatus is  integrated into the tool itself. In either case, score is synchronized to sound  through tapping: with a rectangular tool, the systems  of the score are described. By posting vertical markers within these systems  while listening to the audio file, a correspondence is set up between vertical  posts assigned along the sonogram of the audio file. Spatial coordinates in the  score and temporal ones in the sound file are thus associated and encoded into  an xml file. Since these vertical posts become the &#8220;seams&#8221; along which the  cutting of the score can take place, it is important to place as many as  possible. After the tapping, the synchronization can be corrected by a  displacement of the markers in the audio file. It is worth noting that although  the tapping process is ostensibly neutral and pre-analytic in character, it is  clear that it appeals to the musicality (and therefore situatedness) of the  analyst. That is, crucial musical decisions are made during this step, since  segmentation in the Score Charter can only take place along markers set up  during this process. It is necessary therefore to adopt one of two attitudes: <i>either</i> to listen for important formal  junctures in the sound file, and then to lay down the markers in the  corresponding places on the score, <i>or</i> to look for important junctures in the score, and to lay down markers at these  places, in order to synchronize them to the sound file. In both cases, this  step presupposes musical decisions on the level of listening as well as  score-reading. At the same time, the process of laying down markers requires  multiple listenings to fragments, and may provoke some unexpected analytical  intuitions.</p>
<p>[19] <i>Segmentation/PA Generation</i>:  With the score synchronized to the sound, the score can be segmented into  fragments, while the corresponding sound remains associated with this fragment.  Clicking on a fragment plays the corresponding excerpt. We are then in a position to assign to each of these fragments  a label (preceded by an asterisk in the analysis of the <i>Geisslerlied </i>below) 
that designates the paradigmatic category to  which this fragment belongs. Once every fragment is labeled, the software has  in principle all of the user&#8217;s input it needs to automatically produce a  paradigmatic analysis. This is in fact what happens when the user follows the steps below for producing an   &#8220;APO&#8221;  (&#8220;<i>analyse paradigmatique orthodoxe</i>&#8221;). Since the fragments preserve their timing information, the rules the computer follows to create the PA are simple, and go something like this: take the first chronological element, create a column for it; take the next element, and either create a new column (if it has a different label than its predecessor), or create a new row and place it in the first column (if it has the same label as its predecessor); continue in the same manner until there are no remaining fragments outside of the table.</p>

<p>Once the fragment has been excised from the score and placed either into  the workspace or directly into a chart, the place in the score from which it  was removed turns grey. Since in a classic paradigmatic analysis, each fragment  is used only once, the grey shading indicates visually which fragments have  been used. Exhausting all the fragments in the score corresponds to the score  being entirely shaded grey. However, nothing prevents a user from using the  same fragment more than once, since this could conceivably correspond to a  legitimate form of analytical practice.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>[20] <i>Geisslerlied revisited</i>: A comparison of the tool&#8217;s representation of Ruwet&#8217;s PA of the <i>Geisslerlied</i> (synchronized with MIDI sound since no recording exists of this apparently apocryphal example) with  Ruwet&#8217;s original representation (<b>Application 1</b> vs. Example 4) shows a revealing difference. The order of  the columns is inverted: Ruwet placed columns <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> at the edges of the page, leaving space for what would become his elements <b>c</b> and <b>d</b> in the middle. The Score Charter produces columns in their order of appearance,  placing a and b into adjacent columns, with c and d columns on the right.  Ruwet&#8217;s ordering is not justified by the generative rules 
that he lays out in  the article, which, had they been followed to the letter, would have produced a  chart 
that resembled the Score Charter version. Ruwet&#8217;s decision clearly stems  from a desire to have the larger former units <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>A'</b> etc. each occupy two lines. Also,  his layout seems to be the result of his considering the <b>b</b> element as having a  conclusive function in the phrase. However, his system is ostensibly designed  to dispense with &#8220;fuzzy&#8221; form-functional terms like &#8220;concluding function&#8221; or  &#8220;phrase&#8221;. Ironically, in the first PA in history, Ruwet reveals his own  situatedness and betrays his (non-automatizable) non-neutrality. Hence, the  tool&#8217;s rendering of the <i>Geisslerlied </i>PA  can be used to understand two different directions 
that our research could  have taken: the first direction would have consisted in providing highly  constraining rules 
that dictate how to produce PAs in our tool&#8212;a direction  that could even conceivably lead to a tool for automatically producing such  analyses.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup>			The  problem here is that, as we have just seen, even Ruwet leaves a residue of his  own situatedness in an analysis as simple and as rigorous as his <i>Geisslerlied</i> example. As a result, no  tool 
that generates charts through Ruwet&#8217;s explicit rules of construction  could produce an analysis of the <i>Geisslerlied</i> 
with exactly the same visual layout as his own, a fact that Ruwet may not have  considered a cause for concern, since he concludes his 1966 article by provocatively  declaring that &#8220;it is impossible to represent the structure of a musical piece  by a single schema&#8221; (Ruwet 1966, in <a href="#ruwet_1987" id="citation_ruwet_1987_67dc9afe60a65">1987</a>, 134). In the second direction (the one we favored), the rules of PA are relaxed in such a way as to allow analysts to produce new  versions of paradigmatic charts 
that would not have been possible from within Ruwet&#8217;s system; in particular, ones 
that employ redundancies, variants,  elements not included in the chart, etc. The following paragraph shows an  example of a less orthodox form of PA undertaken with the tool.</p>
<p>[21] In <i>M&eacute;moriale </i>(<nobr>. . .</nobr><i>explosante-fixe</i><nobr>. . .</nobr> <i>Originel</i>) (1985), Pierre Boulez  adopts a form of thematic writing in  which each phrase is given an identifiable contour, nuance, timbre: in a word,  a characteristic &#8220;physiognomy.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup>			In fact, in a lecture devoted to an analysis of <i>M&eacute;moriale</i>, held at McGill University in Montreal in 1991,<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup>			Boulez shows that in that piece, aside from the music from rehearsal number 24 up through but not including rehearsal 25, which 
is generated from  an independent system (a rhythmic canon), there are no more than four  of these fairly easily recognizable thematic units. This invited a simple  paradigmatic approach in which the chart has only four columns, one for each  thematic unit. This makes the chart less than orthodox since two entities  belonging to the same column can differ wildly in terms of their number of  notes, their central or polar note pitch, duration, etc., just as long as they share the same expression marking, phrasing, dynamic marking and playing style. Briefly, here are examples of each of  the four themes, labeled A, B, C, and D. </p>

<p align="left">For  simplicity, only the flute solo part was used in the paradigmatic analysis.  This was justified in terms of the conception of the piece, since <i>M&eacute;moriale</i> began as a solo flute piece, and the flute part was completed in its entirety before Boulez  went about composing the other parts (2 horns, 3 violins, 2 violas, and  a cello). It is reasonable then to assume that the form  of the piece is discernable from the flute part alone. Moreover, rehearsal numbers 22 through 24 (the rhythmic canon) are also excluded from the PA. Here is what the PA of the first page of <i>M&eacute;moriale </i>looks like:</p>

		<i>Analytical difficulties and  modifications of interface that they entailed</i>: It is interesting to look a  bit closer at some of the challenges encountered over the course of this  analysis, in order to highlight the way that the tool can be used. In the case  of one element, its brevity made it difficult to classify, since it could be  thought to possess aspects of A, B or even D 
(see <b>Example 10</b>). The possibility of listening to the fragment and comparing it 
aurally with elements in different columns can help in deciding where it ought 
to be placed. Alternatively, the tool has a function for the duplication of 
elements (button on top right of screen), which allows the user to place the 
same element in two different columns. Another difficulty arose when looking at 
the measures that follow <b>Example 11</b>. 
			If we accept that the above example has the character of a B element, what is less obvious is deciding whether this example comprises a single segment or three distinct ones. Using the tool, the entire excerpt can be cut out  as a single segment, and if necessary, deleted, and the same passage can then be  divided into three separate segments which are then laid out on separate rows  of the PA. At any rate, the tabulation of the work into these four loose-knit  paradigmatic categories was the starting point for the discovery of serial  techniques at work in the ordering of the notes, particularly of the long held  note with which each of them ends, and as such, the PA was the first step  towards an analysis of the type 
		that Nattiez would characterize as 
		<i>external poietics</i>: following the PA,  hypotheses were advanced about the way the work was produced by the composer. The example of 
		<i>M&eacute;moriale</i> brings out the need for another simple but crucial aspect of the interface: we needed a  work (or play) space in which different fragments could be physically  juxtaposed as well as labeled according to categories 
		that were meaningful to  us. This gave rise to two other important features of the interface: the  intermediary (work) space and the labeling system (semanticization).
		</p>

<p>[23] <i>Workspace</i>: In this fairly  indeterminate area, different labels can be freely assigned to the fragments and then compared visually and aurally with other fragments. In the case of <i>M&eacute;moriale</i>, only four semantic labels  were  necessary, but the labeling process did take place in this space,  
which was needed in order to test whether the categories proposed by the  composer were in fact relevant to the analyst&#8217;s conceptualization of the piece.  The need for this space was not recognized initially (after all, the presence of a workspace is  never thematized by writers on PA), but grew out of the collaborative design  project: it was another outgrowth of a  reflection on the <i>process</i> of  analysis. This space proves useful as it allows the user to group similar  fragments together spatially in an informal manner, as a prelude to formally grouping them in the PA.</p>
<p>[24] <i>Semanticization</i>: As for  the paradigmatic labels (those which are associated 
with elements and have names  like <b>*a</b>, <b>*B</b>, etc.), they are neutral in character, and thus are generally  not meaningful in themselves to the analyst. They are sufficient as a way  of encoding elements involved in the  production of a PA (such as the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b> and <b>d</b> of the <i>Geisslerlied</i> and the <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>D</b> of <i>M&eacute;moriale</i>). The reality, however, is that more often than not these  neutral labels become associated with a web of meanings. <i>Either</i> the paradigms are given neutral labels at the beginning (<b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, etc.) and then over the course of  the analysis acquire a musical content in the analyst&#8217;s mind, <i>or</i> the labels given to the paradigms at  the beginning are thoroughly non-neutral (&#8220;jagged melody,&#8221; &#8220;unisons,&#8221; &#8220;head  motive,&#8221; etc.) and are only replaced with neutral symbols at a later stage of  the analysis, and then presented in this manner. In either case, the neutral  symbols become associated with meanings: designations (location in the  score) and/or connotations (heuristic qualitative markers such as &#8220;to-and-fro  motion,&#8221; &#8220;ascending,&#8221; &#8220;espressivo,&#8221; etc.). We wanted to be able to label  fragments with a multiplicity of terms 
that would allow the analyst to  classify them and be reminded of their provenances. In so doing, we are trying to rehabilitate the least  dogmatic and most semantically rich approach to PA possible, one 
that Nattiez  explicitly embraces at one point through his notion of &#8220;paradigmatic theme&#8221;  discussed above ([14] and n. 15) and developed in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind when classifying the phenomena, is  to supply what Molino calls a &#8220;block,&#8221; that is a group of elements  paradigmatically associated which possess a &#8220;family resemblance,&#8221; but for which  the criteria of association are not necessarily identical from the first to the  last element in the paradigm. (<a href="#nattiez_1975b" id="citation_nattiez_1975b_67dc9afe60a89">1975b</a>, 264) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is in the workspace that the analyst identifies these family  resemblances, by proliferating potentially relevant labels during this stage.  Through a process of refinement and reduction, the number of paradigmatic  themes is eventually reduced to a manageable number 
that can be accommodated  into a chart<b> </b>(see <b>Example 12</b>). Of course, nobody is campaigning for the publication of &#8220;honest&#8221;  analyses 
that include the un-retouched mess of the workspaces in which they  were created. Nevertheless, the presentation of finalized, definitive versions  of analytical charts never fails to conceal crucial information for the reader  trying to reconstitute the process of analysis. We could imagine a kind of  compromise in which some elements of the workspace remain in the (online)  published analysis; in particular, those elements 
that get segmented but then do  not find a home in the final chart could be left to linger in the workspace, in  the name of full disclosure, and as an admission that not <i>everything </i>fits comfortably into the analytical viewpoint adopted.</p>

<p align="left">[25] Often, we chart the work in order to become acquainted with it,  without any idea of what the charting process will yield. At other times, a  chart can be a presentation method for a deduction made a previous stage.  In the third and most stimulating case, the chart-making activity provides the  conditions for a new deduction to be made. D&#8217;Indy&#8217;s preceding table, with its  discovery of the &#8220;<i>sch&egrave;me m&eacute;lodique</i>,&#8221; would fall into either the second or the  third of these categories. The question is impossible to answer precisely  because of the static and definitive form of analyses on paper. Other  non-orthodox variants of classic PA can be imagined 
that are particularly apt  at discovering and presenting aspects of large-scale form. </p>

<p>[26] The Score Charter is used in  the following example to bring out how the form of a work can be deduced from  an abstract and unheard model in Pierre Boulez&#8217;s <i>Anth&egrave;mes 1</i> for solo violin (1992). The starting point of this  analysis was the seemingly trivial observation that a melodic profile  consisting of an appoggiatura, followed by a long note often played as a trill,  and concluding with several short notes was typical in Boulez&#8217;s music in  general, and in <i>Anth&egrave;mes </i>
in particular (in which it functions, perhaps, as a sort of macroscopic version 
of the attack-resonance-decay profile of any sound) (<a href="#goldman_2001" id="citation_goldman_2001_67dc9afe60aa3">Goldman 2001</a>). The idea 
was to represent the work as the progressive revelation of the constituent parts 
of an underlying theme that conforms more or less to the three-staged model of 
the Boulezian phrase. Eight different cells belonging to this virtual theme were 
discerned, and the entire 8-minute piece (with the exception of a pizzicato 
section and the concluding section) could be interpreted as the enunciation of a 
theme that exists only in virtual form, and never with a full complement of its 
eight elements, which were labeled <b>a1</b>, <b>a2</b>, <nobr>. . .</nobr><b>a8</b> 
(see <b>Example 13</b>). Placed together (although it never  appears in the piece in this form), these elements form a virtual phrase 
that  more or less follows the tripartite structure outlined above (See 
<b>Example 14</b>; <i>attack</i>: sul pont. tremolo and rising  &#8220;jet&eacute;&#8221; phrase; <i>resonance</i>: trill with  legato phrase underneath; <i>decay</i>:  irregular 16th notes followed by half-hair, half-wood 32nd  notes).</p>
			
<p>[27] The Score Charter can be used to isolate and group together different  instantiations of 
its outputs by assigning one column for each element  of the virtual theme, a1 to a8. This virtual theme can  then be listened to, even if it never appears in unabbreviated form in <i>Anth&egrave;mes</i>.  The tool is then used to  represent the deployment of a virtual theme 
that never appears as such in the  work. In the following example, only the first of Anth&egrave;me&#8217;s six sections is displayed. In this section, only 3 of the 8 elements of the virtual theme are employed:</p>

	<p>The  different instances of the theme can be verified through listening; each  fragment&#8217;s membership in one or another of the columns can be questioned by the  author of the PA as well as by the reader. This example also shows how this  type of unconventional PA can be used to succinctly describe large-scale form.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>


<p align="left">[28] As our last example showed, the frequent use of the tool over the  course of its development leads to new unanticipated issues. Problems with the  current version of the tool as well as possible future extensions are  enumerated here. They have been logged and are in the process of being  integrated into a new version of the tool developed by Thomas Bottini as part of a  larger software project at the Universit&eacute; de Technologie de Compi&egrave;gne (UTC).<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li ><i>Synchronization</i>: in the present version of the tool, once the       synchronization is completed, it cannot be altered at a later stage of the       analysis. This is a problem with respect to our processual point of view.       Synchronization being a step 
	that is laden with analytical       presuppositions, a tool like the Score Charter should allow for some of these       presuppositions to be called into question over the course of the       analysis. In a new version of the tool currently being developed by       Thomas Bottini, the user will be able to modify the placement of the markers at any stage of the analysis, since the synchronization will be integrated into the tool (rather than being imported from MLA).</li>
    <li ><i>Alignment, visual 
	fine-tuning of spacing</i>:<i> </i>in most PAs, it is necessary to       respace the notes so that specific pitches or melodic contours can be       aligned. The tool at present is not precise enough to be able to stretch       stems in order to achieve the kind of alignment that can be achieved on       paper.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>			The new version of the Score Charter should be able to manipulate the       visual spacing of the fragments by non-proportionally-constrained       stretching and contracting.</li>
    <li ><i>Creation of rules</i>: it would be desirable for a       later version of the tool to be able to define rules for chart production.       One could imagine having a catalogue of rules in which fragments are       classified by their duration, by the semantic label they have, etc., and       in which new rules are 
	to be defined by concatenating these. These rules then       become the means for automatically producing different kinds of charts.       The user could then conceivably visually compare the type of chart 
	that a       given rule yields, obtaining the visual result of adopting one set of       rules versus another.</li>

<h3 align="center">VI. <a name="section6">Conclusions</a></h3>
<p>[29] Both the preliminary considerations outlined at the beginning of this article, as well as the practical business of designing a tool like the  Score Charter, compel us to reconsider the status of the chart in music analysis  in general. One of the most salient criticisms of graphic presentations of  analytical data appears in an article by Kofi Agawu (<a href="#agawu_1989" id="citation_agawu_1989_67dc9afe60ab2">1989</a>) on the practice and  the epistemological status of Schenkerian graphs and analytical charts in  general. For him, the abundance of charts and graphs in an analysis is sometimes  used as a smokescreen to hide the lack of specific conclusions or  the inability to synthesize observed facts, causing them to publish elaborate  but problematic analytical works-in-progress. Agawu concludes that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the extensive printing of graphs in our journals may well be a sign that  all is not right. Are not many of the graphs we use pre-analytical  (representing the genesis of the analyst&#8217;s efforts) rather than analytical  (presenting the actual conclusions arising from the analysis)? Except in the  case of didactic works, such printing of long samples of hierarchic notation  with no specific conclusions arising out of the effort seems to me to blur the  dividing line between tautological demonstrations and exhaustive ones (<a href="#agawu_1989" id="citation_agawu_1989_67dc9afe60ab4">Agawu 1989</a>, 295).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may well be that the malaise that Agawu observes is a feature of&nbsp;the paper medium for music analysis,  rather than a problem with excessively data-rich analytical charts in general. Agawu would  like scholarly articles in scientific journals to provide compact charts 
that  are resyntheses of the data culled over the course of the analysis, placed in a  manner considerably removed from the analytical process through which the  results were derived. Once we are  dealing with analyses 
that begin life as multimedia objects, this constraint can be relaxed. The 
dynamic character of multimedia representations of tabular information can 
conveniently encapsulate in compact form different stages of the analysis 
without the abuse of charts that Agawu deplores. Following this approach, not 
only are the results accessible, but also the steps and the operations that <i>led</i> to those results, a form of methodological  transparency 
that adds to the scientific credentials of music analysis by  inviting refutation at each step. If we wish to better integrate into the  writing of analysis the fact that the results presented are first and foremost  the culmination of a listening practice, then we must find ways to connect <i>technologies of publication </i>to the <i>analytical apparatus </i>itself. This is  done in such a way that readers can assimilate the analysis by redoing it  themselves, allowing them also to extend, to modify or to contradict the  analysis proposed. Agawu&#8217;s criticism of publishing snapshots of pre-analytical tabulation is rooted in it being a  wasteful or futile activity in the paper medium, particularly when no  particular conclusions are drawn from them. One could imagine that Agawu might be  less critical of a non-paper multimedia context in which access to the  conclusion implies that the user must pass through some decisive stages, either the  real stages of the analysis, or (preferably?) their reduction into a logical progression: a fictional narrative constructed for didactic reasons.</p>
<p>[30] In the realm of multimedia projects focusing on musical works, two  approaches 
that implement specifically process-based presentations have been explored: one which allows the reader to engage with the processes through which the composer  produced the work, and the other with the processes through which the analyst produced the  analysis. An example of a project of the first kind, which allows the reader to  engage with the composer&#8217;s creative processes, is a DVD-Rom produced by the APM team on the work <i>Voi(rex) </i>by French composer Philippe  Leroux.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup>			The  Score Charter, on the other hand, takes the opposite tack, in that it allows  the reader to follow the <i>analyst&#8217;s</i> 
paths to the work rather than the composer&#8217;s. There are examples of projects 
having  aspects of both of these approaches. One in particular is of special interest  to us since it uses paradigmatic methods: Michael Clarke&#8217;s analysis 
of Jonathan Harvey&rsquo;s <i>Mortuos  Plango Vivos Voco</i>, which  appeared in a book chapter in a volume  devoted to the analysis of electroacoustic 
music. On the accompanying CD-ROM, the reader is both invited  to perform some of 
the compositional operations that Harvey used (but in the context of an analog  studio) to construct the piece, and to follow a paradigmatic presentation of it (cf. <a href="#clarke_2006" id="citation_clarke_2006_67dc9afe60ab8">Clarke 2006</a>), using the software package Clarke helped to  develop, Sybil (cf. <a href="#clarke_2005" id="citation_clarke_2005_67dc9afe60aba">Clarke 2005</a>).<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>			Of course, Clarke&#8217;s analysis does not use PA as part of its discovery strategy,  since the material is already segmented according to sketches 
that the  composer made available to him; the PA serves the purposes of presentation  only. However, Clarke&#8217;s work deserves recognition for being the first example  of an auditory PA ever published, and makes a major step towards countering a  serious criticism often leveled at PA.</p>
<p>[31] Nicholas Cook, in his <i>Guide to Musical Analysis</i>, lumped  &#8220;semiotic analysis&#8221; in the category&nbsp;&#8220;Formal Approaches to Analysis&#8221; along  with 
set theory (<a href="#cook_1987" id="citation_cook_1987_67dc9afe60abc">Cook 1987</a>, chapter 4). He defined &#8220;formal analysis&#8221; as &#8220;any  kind of analysis that involves coding music into symbols and deducing the  musical structure from the pattern these symbols make&#8221; (<a href="#cook_1987" id="citation_cook_1987_67dc9afe60abe">1987</a>, 116), and  expressed his doubts about the usefulness of PA for musical understanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is this: how much of what matters about music is retained in  the translation from sound-experiences to abstract categories such as  &#8220;ascending conjunct line&#8221;? Can we say anything important about the experience  of a given line simply by classifying it as the opposite of lines which are  descending or disjunct? Aren&#8217;t we in danger of making precise statements about  musical scores which have only the vaguest connection with the music we  experience? (<a href="#cook_1987" id="citation_cook_1987_67dc9afe60abf">Cook 1987</a>, 181)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This criticism is not wholly  unjustified, and it may indeed hold of the two analyses 
that he studied. His  criticism, according to which PA is cut off from lived musical &#8220;experience&#8221; and its results  difficult to generalize, were valid at the time, and may very well account for the fact  that few music analysts seemed to take a serious interest in  this practice. In 1987, of course, it would have appeared farfetched that were  PA, that most algorithmic and &#8220;machine-like&#8221; of methods, transposed onto the  computer, it could integrate listening experiences through its auditory  component. And yet a tool like the Score Charter could possibly be used to  integrate the listening subject&nbsp;into the analysis, and to make visible the  distinctive listening experience of the analyst. This would be the furthest  thing from the &#8220;formal approaches&nbsp;to analysis&#8221; 
that Cook had in mind.  Such an approach could lead PA away from the formalist, notation-centric (to  use Philip Tagg&#8217;s terminology 
[<a href="#tagg_1987" id="citation_tagg_1987_67dc9afe60acd">1987</a>, 284]) model to one that incorporates critical listening into its  apparatus.</p>
<p>[32] As for the personal, situated character of analyses, Bruno Nettl,  in the 1983 edition of <i>The Study of  Ethnomusicology</i>, raised a concern 
that deals not with the analytical  &#8220;yield&#8221; of PA, but with its role within a community of analysts. In  semiotic-inspired analyses such as those of Nattiez and Charles Boil&egrave;s, in  vogue in ethnomusicology at the time, Nettl notes that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the methods become more and more complex; in a sense  they give more information but are harder to read, lend themselves less easily  to comparison, and are more difficult to apply by someone who did not originate  them. Despite the universalist intention, they turn out to be culture-specific,  or at best scholar-specific. (<a href="#nettl_2005" id="citation_nettl_2005_67dc9afe60acf">Nettl 2005</a>, 95)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nettl&#8217;s criticism is the sociocultural counterpart of Agawu&#8217;s technical  criticism, and needs to be taken seriously: certainly, an analysis can be  specific to a particular researcher (a particular listener), but, as has been  emphasized already, PA can be a method of transmitting this unique way of  hearing to an open-minded other. Nettl was correct to note that PAs are complex  and difficult to read, but couldn&#8217;t this be a result of the fact that their  practitioners over-emphasized the need to make every step explicit? After all,  the goal of PA is the same as that of a mathematical proof: to convince the  reader. As such, a PA, just like a mathematical proof, should only contain as  much information&#8212;and no more&#8212;as is needed to convince the reader of the point  of view of its creator. As in mathematics, it is understood that a fully-explicit  argument is possible in theory, but inconvenient and unnecessary in practice. Once PA is  implemented as a method for transmitting musical experiences, it could  transcend the solipsism that Nettl rightly observed in some PAs. With a  software PA, a reader who wants to retrace all of the steps of the analysis  can do so, as was noted with respect to Agawu&#8217;s argument above. Moreover, if it is true that the present musicological era has  gone &#8220;beyond structural listening,&#8221; then there is more than one correct way of  listening to music (or indeed, if it has gone postmodern, then there is <i>no</i> correct way). A multimedia environment in which different analyses can all be opened  in the same interface favors comparison and evaluation: both multiple interpretations of a single work and  navigation through a corpus of several works. Although the Score Charter is  conceived primarily as a method for studying individual works, and not as a  response to Nattiez&#8217;s early hopes (invoked above) to use PA in the service of  style analysis of large repertories on the model of archeology, it would be  desirable to extend a multimedia tool to encompass analyses of groups of works (the works of a single  composer, of a single period, etc.).</p>
<p>[33] A final word is in order about  automation. From the point of view of computer science, this tool is strikingly  lacking in innovation, since it contains no new algorithms. If there is  anything innovative in it at all it is the idea of having theorists and  musicologists conceive and design their own tools specially adapted to their  needs, rather than being forced to make pre-existing <i>musical</i> tools (Finale, MaxMSP) perform <i>musicological</i> tasks for which they were not designed, or oblige  musicologists to learn from scratch non-musical programming environments in  order to perform tasks specific to music analysis. The Score Charter, conversely,  is designed with very well-identified music-analytic goals in mind (making  charts of scores), with the hope that the tool could then be applied to perform  other (analytic) tasks for which it was not specifically conceived.  Nevertheless, far from being opposed to computer-assisted analysis, certain  stages of the analytical process could doubtless benefit from automation, such  as the synchronization process, or the outputs of performance information  analysis. In later versions, the Score Charter could be given connectivity with  other tools 
that take charge of some of the automatizable stages of the  analysis. However, 
the creators of our tool are interested in some of the necessarily unautomatizable stages in the analytical process: those which appeal to  analytical decision-making based on one&#8217;s specific musical culture (such as the  rules for chart-forming described above) and which could benefit from the versatility provided by a digital interface. The collaborative design project  would have to be extended to find out, in conjunction with the software  developers, just <i>which</i> automatizable  aspects of the analytical process would be feasible. Here again, such a study  would necessarily have two facets: a technological project as well as a  genealogical investigation of a crucial practice in music theory since its  inception.</p>

In  this case, he encloses the re-written fragments in parentheses.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Cf. <a href="#chemillier_2009" id="citation_chemillier_2009_67dc9afe5c6f9">Chemillier 2009</a>.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">This presentation will only touch on those aspects of the analysis which relate  to PA analysis with the Score Charter. For a thorough analysis of M&eacute;moriale, cf. Goldman (<a href="#goldman_2009" id="citation_goldman_2009_67dc9afe5c6fc">2009</a>).</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">A cassette recording of this lecture was consulted at the Pierre Boulez Archive at the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al&#8217;s Faculty of Music.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">One might encounter material constraints when using the tool for a longer work with denser orchestration, even with a large monitor. This limitation is equally true of any attempt to publish a PA in a book or journal, however.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv"><a href='http://scenari-platform.org/poliesc/'>POLIESC</a>: <i>Pratiques Ordinaires, Lectures Intensives et &Eacute;critures Structur&eacute;es de  Contenus num&eacute;riques multim&eacute;dia.</i></div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">After viewing a demonstration of the Score Charter in 2006 at McGill University, Jean-Jacques Nattiez noted that superimposed elements in the tool&rsquo;s PAs could not be sufficiently aligned.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">The DVD &ldquo;De Voi(rex) &agrave; Apocalypsis, fragments d&#8217;une gen&egrave;se: exploration multim&eacute;dia du  travail de composition de Philippe Leroux,&rdquo; Nicolas Donin, Samuel Goldszmidt,  and Jacques Theureau, which appeared as a supplement to L&#8217;inou&iuml;&ndash;Revue de l&#8217;IRCAM 2 (2006). This  DVD-ROM allows the user to perform some of the electroacoustic operations which  gave rise to the piece (for voice, instruments and electronics). Cf. review of DVD in <a href="#th&eacute;berge_2008" id="citation_th&eacute;berge_2008_67dc9afe5c6ff">Th&eacute;berge 2008</a>, in which another  IRCAM multimedia project dealing with contemporary music composition is  discussed, a CD-ROM on Roger Reynolds&#8217; Angel  of Death, produced by Stephen McAdams and Marc Battier (Paris: IRCAM-Centre  Pompidou, 2005).</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">Cf.
