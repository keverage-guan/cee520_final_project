<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] By the end of the 1960s, the coalition of forces involved in civil rights 
campaigning had dissolved: white liberals who were happy to call for voting rights 
and an end to <i>de jure</i> segregation blanched when Malcolm X and eventually 
Martin Luther King condemned government and business interests in northern cities 
for their maintenance of economic inequality and <i>de facto</i> segregation; SNCC 
and CORE expelled their white members and came under increasing police surveillance 
and provocation; the Black Panthers seized the moment by putting into practice the 
kind of self defense Malcolm X had called for, but even they collapsed under sustained 
and violent FBI suppression. At the same time Nixon encouraged the suppression of 
radical black movements, he finessed the Black Power movement, turning it into a 
mechanism for generating black entrepreneurs and professionals to be co-opted by 
the system under the cloak of radical rhetoric.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2] Black musical culture may have become big business in the 60s, but it was 
still responsive to changes in the black community. The non-violence of the early-60s 
campaigns had been dependent on its appeal to the conscience of the Washington political 
establishment, or on its threat to their international image (it certainly wasn&rsquo;t 
going to pull on the heartstrings of the southern police and Citizens&rsquo; Councils); 
when this strategy had evidently run its course, black musical culture also underwent 
a shift: the assiduously non-threatening Tamla Motown began to give way to music 
which was much less concerned about its appeal to white audiences, and leading this 
trend was James Brown, the &ldquo;father of funk.&rdquo; Brown was considered so influential 
within black America that he was courted by both the Black Panthers and Nixon: the 
Panthers demanded that he use his influence more constructively (&ldquo;Say it loud, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m 
black and I&rsquo;m proud!!&rsquo;,&rdquo; was the immediate result), while Nixon succeeded in gaining 
Brown&rsquo;s endorsement for his re-election campaign. Funk was recognized as the expression 
of the black ghettos, until its adoption by major recording companies pressured 
even such highly respected funk bands as Kool &amp; The Gang to dilute their music into 
the more marketable and non-threatening disco.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> The economic downturn that began 
in the early 70s led to the ravaging of black neighborhoods, as big business sought 
to maintain its profit margins by squeezing those least able to fight back.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Not 
only was the standing of funk damaged by its association with disco, but the expense 
involved in creating funk was now beyond the means of so many in the ghettos.
</p>
<p>[3] Hip-hop emerged from one of the worst ghettos: the South Bronx, to which 
many black and Latino residents were forcibly relocated&mdash;out of sight and out of 
mind&mdash;when their Manhattan neighborhoods caught the eye of property developers.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Through the expanding repertoire of techniques employed by DJs such as Kool Herc 
and Grandmaster Flash, and the refinement of rapping (MC-ing), often in competition 
between gangs, the basis for hip-hop was created in extreme adversity (to the wealthy 
policy-makers who propagate the &ldquo;cultural pathology&rdquo; thesis of &ldquo;black under-achievement&rdquo;: 
whose is the pathology that created the ghettos, and whose the cultural achievement 
in the face of this?). In time, cassette recordings began to circulate, and then 
in 1979 two commercial recordings were issued, using MCs alongside live musicians 
(rather than a DJ).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> This provoked better established hip-hop crews into seeking 
commercial contracts themselves, with various small, specialist labels. By the end 
of the 80s, however, hip-hop music had become big business, and the existing hip-hop 
labels were offered lucrative distribution deals by major recording companies.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> By this stage, as a by-product of the Reagan administration&rsquo;s covert funding of 
the Nicaraguan Contras, black and Latino neighborhoods of Los Angeles were flooded 
with cocaine, which in the form of crack transformed the economy of the ghetto, 
and produced the way of life reported, celebrated, and sometimes lamented in gangsta 
rap. In reaction to these developments, other hip-hop artists attempted to provide 
more edifying alternatives, with various combinations of political critique (of 
police <i>and</i> gangsters), Afrocentrism, religious black nationalism (the Nation 
of Islam and the 5% Nation) and the invocation of jazz as a black cultural model.
</p>
<p>[4] During the 80s, the white, high-art world had already assimilated (or so 
it thought) a one-time inhabitant of hip-hop culture, the former graffiti artist 
Jean-Michel Basquiat.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Now, at the beginning of the 90s, it was time for academia 
to acknowledge hip-hop music (all but one of the sources on hip-hop cited in the 
volume under review date from after 1990).<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> In 1991, Richard Shusterman&rsquo;s <i>Pragmatist 
Aesthetics</i> included a thoughtful study of Stetsasonic&rsquo;s celebrated &ldquo;Talkin&rsquo; 
All That Jazz,&rdquo; although the semantic content of the lyrics greatly overshadowed 
musical aspects of the song.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Tricia Rose made one of the most important contributions 
to the literature in 1994, in <i>Black Noise</i>, which included one of the earlier 
feminist accounts of hip-hop misogyny and female rappers.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> bell hooks also provided 
some subtle feminist critiques, but tellingly had her interview with Ice Cube &ldquo;sliced 
to ribbons&rdquo; by the commissioning magazine when the hoped-for battle royal turned 
out to be a respectful dialogue (with Ice Cube condemning male violence against 
women).<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> In 1995, Russell Potter considered hip-hop in the context of postmodernism, 
and provided an eclectic series of lyrics-based analyses in <i>Spectacular Vernaculars</i>.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> In the same year, a wide ranging collection of essays, many on topics which had 
received little attention before, appeared as <i>Droppin&rsquo; Science</i>, edited by 
William Perkins.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In 1998, Robin D. G. Kelley contributed the most memorable 
title in the literature&mdash;&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; Mama&rsquo;s Disfunktional!&rdquo;&mdash;and provided a pointed and 
often witty critique of how the maintenance of black stereotypes meshes with reactionary 
social policy.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> In the year following the publication of Krims&rsquo;s volume there 
has been an interesting exploration of his central topic: the construction of identities 
through hip-hop, in <i>Performing Identity/Performing Culture</i>, by Greg Dimitriadis,<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> and one of Krims&rsquo;s other major concerns&mdash;the internationalization of hip-hop&mdash;has 
been addressed in the forthcoming <i>Global Noise</i>, edited by Tony Mitchell.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>
<p>[5] Krims notes in his Introduction that the validation of rap &ldquo;via expositions 
of some of its poetics turns out to be a project of a surprisingly high percentage 
of scholarship, occurring far more frequently than in any other genre I know of&rdquo; 
(p. 13). This should probably be no surprise: considering the vilification of urban 
ghetto inhabitants in the national press, through selective statistics and manipulations
<i>a la</i> &ldquo;Willie&rdquo; Horton, the cultural products of those communities need more 
defending in the academy than any other artifacts. Let us grant that hip-hop has 
been in existence for a quarter of a century, and compare the status of hip-hop 
today with the status of bebop in the mid 60s, about a quarter century after its 
inception; one might wonder whether say, Rakim, or DJ Premier will ever enjoy the 
kind of iconic status long ago accorded to Charlie Parker (which is certainly not 
to say that hip-hop should ever strive to be &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Classical Music&rdquo;). But after 
a decade of hip-hop scholarship, Krims is fortunately able to &ldquo;assume the importance 
of the subject matter and continue from there&rdquo; (p. 13). Instead of having to engage 
in any lengthy validation of hip-hop as a legitimate field of study, he must instead 
justify his own book-length addition to a body of scholarship that is already substantial. 
And his justification is that the relation of &ldquo;musical design to cultural workings 
in detail is what may prove to separate this book from the other fine collections 
and monographs on the topic of rap music and/or hip-hop culture&rdquo; (p. 14).</p>
<p>[6] Krims painstakingly qualifies and defends his commitment to musical &ldquo;close 
reading.&rdquo; This approach is, after all, viewed with deep suspicion by popular-music 
scholars from a non-musicological/music-theoretical background: &ldquo;The argument asserts 
that such analyses treat the music as if it were some self-existent object whose 
meaning can be determined outside creative and diverse responses of communities&rdquo; 
(p. 20). But as Krims argues, close reading need not imply reification and mystification, 
and he cites in his favor the very different status that close reading enjoys in 
film studies; the suspicion musical close reading draws upon itself arises specifically 
from the role it has performed within music scholarship in the past (see pp. 17&ndash;24). 
And this takes us to the heart of Krims&rsquo;s present project: &ldquo;I aim here at nothing 
less than asserting that studying musical poetics can be a task of the greatest 
social relevance, even in some cases an indispensable (though never sufficient) 
part of the cultural study of music&rdquo; (p. 14).</p>
<p>[7] Krims intends his monograph to fulfill three functions within and across 
disciplinary boundaries. First, this is a music-theoretical project that is meant 
to broaden music theorists&rsquo; conception of their discipline. Second, this is also 
a musicological work designed to reinforce the various tendencies that used to be 
identified as &ldquo;the new musicology.&rdquo; Third, Krims&rsquo;s ultimate ambition is that the 
present volume should serve as a stepping-stone towards the day when both music 
theory and musicology can take their place as specialized regions within the broader 
field of cultural studies. But this is not to suggest that Krims adopts hip-hop 
as an arbitrary tool to reshape or break down disciplinary boundaries. On the contrary, 
he argues that hip-hop and cultural identities are among the social practices and 
constructions that eventually bring about such changes within scholarly activity 
(see p. 4). Krims himself is not only a member of the international audience for 
commercial hip-hop recordings, but has also been an occasional contributor to the 
culture, as instrumentalist and producer. It is hardly surprising, then, that Adorno 
receives only a passing mention; Krims cannot endorse the Adornian critique of mass 
culture, and therefore feels no compulsion to justify his work by attributing &ldquo;resistant 
readings&rdquo; to hip-hop&rsquo;s audiences. While admitting that the hip-hop featured in his 
book has been filtered through the needs and marketing strategies of the recording 
industry, he recognizes that hip-hop is nevertheless capable of constructing identities 
which, though often not genuinely oppositional, nevertheless stand outside the limits 
of the dominant ideology.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> This approach is better able to face the ability of 
present-day capital to absorb almost anything (even anti-capitalist literature is 
becoming a highly marketable commodity) without sinking back into the pessimism 
of Adorno, or the complacency of the post-modernist tendency to celebrate what is 
supposedly undefeatable. Hip-hop reception in the last decade has featured a number 
of moral panics, usually with a racist subtext;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> notoriously, even Bill Clinton 
entered the fray, attacking Sistah Souljah for a comment made after the 1992 Los 
Angeles rebellion.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> But the moralizing rhetoric has never done anything more 
than shuffle the deck of hip-hop artists, labels and distributors; moralizing (against 
black communities) serves moneyed interests, but if it conflicts with those interests 
it can always be kept in check. If hip-hop were perceived as a real threat to capital, 
it would certainly not be the largest sector of the recording industry today.</p>
<p>[8] After a substantial and useful introduction, Krims lays out his case in five 
chapters, none of which draw substantially on previously published material, although 
each could be read independently of the others without serious detriment. Chapters 
1 and 2 are general, while Chapters 3&ndash;5 are more concrete, featuring case studies 
of particular hip-hop artists and &ldquo;songs.&rdquo; Chapter 1 attempts to show how music 
analysis can fit within cultural-studies scholarship, answering the standard objections 
to analysis while granting their partial validity (in general, that they pass fair 
comment only on the bulk of past practice). Krims recommends that the scope of music 
theory should be extended to all &ldquo;theory about music,&rdquo; while within this, &ldquo;musical 
poetics&rdquo; is that part of music theory which deals with the organization of sound 
in music. With regard to hip-hop, musical poetics is required in order to demonstrate 
how cultural identities are encoded in songs. Chapter 2 moves squarely onto hip-hop 
territory, discussing the system of generic categories recognized by hip-hop artists 
and their audience, and showing how these categories can be defined to a large extent 
through musical poetics; Krims is careful not to take this too far, and avoids de-historicizing 
or essentializing hip-hop genres.</p>
<p>[9] Chapter 3 takes a single song as a case study, namely Ice Cube&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Nigga 
Ya Love to Hate,&rdquo; produced by the Bomb Squad (Public Enemy&rsquo;s producers). Krims now 
presents the full technical apparatus of his hip-hop analyses: avoiding staff notation, 
he uses a grid system to convey rhythms, which widens his potential readership to 
all those familiar with sequencer programs; pitch is covered by letter names for 
notes and chords. While the small-scale analyses using this apparatus provide accurate 
transcriptions of the Bomb Squad&rsquo;s dense, multi-layered music, perhaps most impressive 
is the large-scale formal-textural diagram of the song, packed with detail that 
requires several listenings to appreciate. Krims discusses how this song exemplifies 
the &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; style and constructs a &ldquo;black revolutionary subject&rdquo; (I find the 
latter problematic, as I discuss below). Chapter 4 explains how geographically defined 
identities are formed in hip-hop, with special attention to the work of the Atlanta-based 
Goodie MoB. Geography was already a matter of dispute by the mid-80s even within 
the confines of NYC (Bronx-based KRS-One repudiated MC Shan&rsquo;s rival claims for Queensbridge),<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> but as hip-hop spread to other urban centers across the U.S., different styles were 
formed in the effort to assert independence from New York. Some of the more rudimentary 
analytical apparatus is used to this end, but there is nothing approaching the detail 
or scope of the Ice Cube analysis of the previous chapter (perhaps this was not 
needed, but one might suspect from the sophistication of Chapter 3 that it was the 
last to be written). Chapter 5 traces the spread of hip-hop beyond the U.S., with 
case studies in the Netherlands&mdash;the Amsterdam-based Spookrijders&mdash;and Canada&mdash;the 
Cree MC Bannock, based in Edmonton, Alberta (whose image appears on the book&rsquo;s front 
cover). Krims has worked with Bannock, and is therefore able, owing to his insider&rsquo;s 
knowledge, to provide a more intimate account. Indeed, the Bannock item in the book&rsquo;s 
discography has not even been commercially released. International communities of 
hip-hop artists are shown to interact dialectically with U.S. hip-hop; the art of 
the DJ, for example, had its origins in Jamaica, and after waning in the U.S. during 
the early 90s, it was revitalized partly under the influence of outsiders, such 
as DJ Honda of Japan, and DJ Dave of Germany.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>
<p>[10] Krims has devised an efficient terminological framework for the technical 
discussion of style and genre. Because the implied conceptual divisions play a foundational 
role here, Krims is at pains to justify his choices by tracing them back to the 
discursive practices of hip-hop artists, journalists, and fans. The MC&rsquo;s flow, that 
is, the non-semantic aspects of rap delivery (principally rhythm and rhyme schemes), 
can follow one of three styles according to Krims: &ldquo;sung,&rdquo; &ldquo;percussion-effusive,&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;speech-effusive.&rdquo; The first corresponds roughly to &ldquo;old school&rdquo; flow: &ldquo;rhythmic 
repetition, on-beat accents, regular on-beat pauses, and strict couplet groupings&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;sung&rdquo; because the spoken delivery resembles song except in respect to pitch) (p. 
50). The two &ldquo;effusive&rdquo; styles are both characteristically &ldquo;new school&rdquo; (late 80s 
onwards), and are marked by &ldquo;a tendency to spill over the rhythmic boundaries of 
the meter [and] the couplet, staggering the syntax and/or the rhymes, [and] creating 
polyrhythms with four-measure groupings of 4/4 time&rdquo; (p. 50). The opposition between 
the two effusive styles is then a percussive approach with clear articulation and 
staccato delivery, generally with recurring rhythmic patterns, versus an approach 
closer to normal speech with more vaguely defined rhythmic location and articulation 
and highly irregular rhythms (p. 51). While Krims has had to coin his own terms, 
he has not imposed an alien structure on hip-hop practices, but only teased out 
the basis for the old-school/new-school distinction universally understood among 
hip-hop&rsquo;s audiences. </p>
<p>[11] On the level of genre, Krims presents four categories: &ldquo;party,&rdquo; &ldquo;mack,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;jazz/bohemian&rdquo; and &ldquo;reality&rdquo; rap, discussing the characteristics of musical style, 
flow and (discursive) topics for each one; all four terms have some currency in 
familiar hip-hop discourse. Party rap is the oldest of the genres (or strictly, 
the pre-generic default), typified by relatively fast and danceable funk or disco 
samples, sung flow and lyrics marked by &ldquo;celebration, pleasure and humour.&rdquo; Krims 
offers a telling example of party-rap being treated as a musical topic by KRS-One 
at the opening of &ldquo;MCs Act Like They Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; before he reverts to the speech-effusive 
flow that was his default by the time this song was recorded (1995) (pp. 58&ndash;62).<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Mack rap is typified by uncomplicated R&amp;B-style music, and, of course, by lyrics 
featuring &ldquo;boasts of sexual prowess, attempts at seduction&rdquo; and &ldquo;images of wealth&rdquo; 
(p. 64). Jazz/bohemian rap, the most artistically self-conscious genre, is eclectic 
in its musical styles, often referential or humorous in its use of samples, and 
sometimes turning (non-ironically) to jazz. Topics are equally wide-ranging, from 
the opacity of some De La Soul lyrics to the rejection of mack or gangsta values, 
to the advocacy of Afrocentricity (see pp. 65&ndash;70). Finally, reality rap cultivates 
a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; style, which on the East Coast generally meant dense, multi-layered 
and often clashing samples (established by Public Enemy&rsquo;s producers, the Bomb Squad),<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> while on the West Coast, the preference for George Clinton samples or live funk 
backing (the G-Funk style) meant that the burden of establishing &ldquo;hardness&rdquo; fell 
on the lyrics (an example of geographic marking). The speech-effusive flow style 
has predominated in reality rap from the early 90s onwards. Topics are diverse, 
but &ldquo;ghetto authenticity&rdquo; provides a common denominator: lyrics may celebrate or 
lament the various aspects of gang life, they may call for political engagement 
and/or present the values and ideas of the NOI or 5% Nation (see pp. 70&ndash;80). Krims 
rightly regards all these genres as mutually permeable, but this does not undermine 
the provisional usefulness of the distinctions. </p>
<p>[12] Anyone who has read this far will be in no doubt that the present reviewer 
holds Krims&rsquo;s volume in high regard. There are, however, some problems to address. 
First, and most superficially, there are occasional baroque flourishes&mdash;concessions 
to fashion&mdash;that may, for a moment, undermine some readers&rsquo; confidence in Krims&rsquo;s 
seriousness (they should persevere). The cultivation of pseudo-paradoxes is one 
fashionable habit that makes an appearance in this volume: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[O]ne might try to retain a picture of a vernacular culture and a mass culture. 
  Such a thing is simultaneously impossible and necessary; impossible, because at 
  any given moment any representation will emphasize one aspect over another, but 
  necessary, because both are indispensable truths. (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what is possible &ldquo;at any given moment&rdquo; is an irrelevance: there are over 
two hundred pages in the present volume&mdash;plenty of room for giving both aspects 
a good airing. Readers will not be surprised to hear that Krims succeeds in fulfilling 
his &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; but necessary task. And then, a little later, Lacan appears:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If my presence in the rest of the book can be charted, then I am assuming (indeed, 
  not-so-secretly hoping), that it may be charted in the way that iek describes 
  Lacan&rsquo;s view of the Subject&mdash;that the Subject is signaled by that which &ldquo;perturbs 
  the smooth engine of symbolization and throws it off balance, an anamorphic entity 
  that gains its consistency only in retrospect, viewed from within the symbolic 
  horizon.&rdquo; (p. 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some readers will doubtless take delight in such pretty word patterns, but they 
might do well to ask themselves whether the present volume could generate much interest 
if it were written in this manner throughout. Krims&rsquo;s achievement is clear, and 
does not need the adornment of such tinsel.</p>
<p>[13] A more serious problem emerges in the methodology of Chapter 3 (the analysis 
of Ice Cube&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Nigga Ya Love to Hate&rdquo;) when Krims moves from the formal/textural 
analysis to the consideration of interpretations that can be attached to (putatively) 
significant details emerging from that analysis. The source of the problem seems 
to be that Krims required only a modest analysis in order to make the points he 
raises elsewhere about style and genre. To the mind of this reader, the grand analysis 
of Chapter 3 is of great interest in itself (although I wouldn&rsquo;t want to see the 
same approach repeated endlessly in graduate dissertations as a hip-hop equivalent 
to Schenker or Forte). But Krims seems convinced that these analytical efforts stand 
in need of interpretative justification, as if his leaving any part of the analysis 
to stand alone would constitute an aestheticization of the song, an imposition of 
art-work ideology (and as if all he had said to the contrary suddenly counted for 
nothing). In fact Krims&rsquo;s interpretative imperative eventually leads him (paradoxically, 
if you must) to treat the song as if it were a text lending itself to limitless 
scrutiny outside of its real-time playback. And this also causes him to write as 
if he were working within the resistant-reading faction of cultural studies, clutching 
at any tiny detail that might, if poked and prodded for a while, yield up a tiny 
squeak of opposition to the dominant ideology. This accounts for the long and tortuous 
comparison of two phrases: &ldquo;Tom, Dick and Hank&rdquo; and &ldquo;build, mold and fold&rdquo;; Krims 
tries to argue that the <i>lack </i>of a cymbal attack together with the first &ldquo;and,&rdquo; 
and the <i>presence</i> of a synthesizer attack together with the second &ldquo;and&rdquo; is 
highly significant.&nbsp; Without rehearsing Krims&rsquo;s entire argument, the former 
indicates resistance to a &ldquo;white&rdquo; identity, the latter support for Ice Cube&rsquo;s &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; 
identity (pp. 112&ndash;16; I&rsquo;m not sure that Krims has even convinced himself by the 
end of the discussion). I simply cannot believe that Ice Cube or the Bomb Squad 
had the leisure time to consider any of this in the studio&mdash;and the two events, 
note, are quite distant from each other in the song. Even less could I believe that 
this minute difference had prompted any other listener to draw the same conclusions. 
If we assign some kind of agency to texts themselves, then there is, of course no 
problem, but this is crass mystification of a kind I do not believe Krims would 
want to endorse. The problem is perhaps symptomatic of the tendency to treat all 
artifacts as texts, marginalizing the peculiarities of different media; some artifacts 
are experienced as they unfold in real time, which severely discourages the kind 
of contemplative examination that texts&mdash;in the standard, written sense&mdash;allow.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></p>
<p>[14] Some aspects of Krims&rsquo;s political analysis are also questionable. Krims 
attributes the major shift in the humanities to the new economic environment of 
&ldquo;post-Fordism,&rdquo; while music theory remains a relic of Fordism and Cold War imperatives.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> But the notion that we live in a post-Fordist world today, although prominent in 
cultural-studies discourse, is, I would argue, delusory, and if so, Krims would 
need to find a new basis for the shift. First, post-Fordist theorists mischaracterize 
Fordist mass production: the Model T case&mdash;a single product, unchanging over a long 
period&mdash;was more exception than rule. Second, much industrial plant during the period 
in question (from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century up to about 1970) was adaptable 
to new lines. Third, mass production was applicable only to complex consumer durables 
(electrical goods, cars, etc.), and not to other large sectors of the economy: capital-intensive 
processing (steel, chemicals) or labor-intensive manufacture (clothing, furniture). 
Fourth, the post-Fordist thesis that standardized production is receding due to 
the loss of mass markets is contradicted by all the evidence: cars, washing machines, 
and other consumer durables of long standing are still required in larger numbers 
than ever, while new generations of such goods have also found mass markets (microwave 
ovens, CD players, etc.). Fifth, post-Fordist theory exaggerates the internationalization 
of trade: most large corporations are still based in their country of origin, and 
a large proportion of their output is still sold in those countries. Sixth, the 
post-Fordist analysis of an international labor market consisting of privileged 
core and oppressed periphery is exaggerated: job insecurity, low pay, and rising 
hours are characteristic of all labor markets today. I could go on, but this should 
suffice to make the point.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>
<p>[15] There is, it seems to me, a further problem over the notion of a &ldquo;revolutionary 
identity&rdquo; (here, the identity Ice Cube supposedly constructs for himself). That 
Ice Cube&rsquo;s artistic stance is in various ways oppositional can hardly be in doubt, 
but whether it is revolutionary is quite another matter. Since his 1991 album <i>
Death Certificate</i>, Ice Cube has identified with the Nation of Islam in his lyrics; 
the NOI, although its rhetoric may strike a radical chord, is conservative in its 
social and moral outlook, and explicitly capitalist in its program for the advancement 
of Black Americans (but like Marcus Garvey before them, they oppose the ingratiation 
of white capitalists in the manner of Booker T. Washington). Today there are some 
black bankers and CEOs, but this is no revolutionary development; indeed, regardless 
of the racist jibes and police harassment they suffer in common, such persons have 
placed themselves in class conflict with Black American workers (and unemployed). 
Let us not equivocate: class is not merely another identity to be thrown into the 
mix; one can be proud to be Irish, say, or even&mdash;help us&mdash;proud to be a music theorist, 
but not proud to be an exploiter, or proud to be exploited. The very coupling of 
&ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; and &ldquo;identity&rdquo; is also questionable. Identity politics has served 
in various ways to undermine more radical demands. <span lang="en-us">Ethnic-</span>minority politicians have 
relied upon ethnic-solidarity voting while they are progressively co-opted by the 
racist system they were expected to oppose; thus Wilson Goode, Philadelphia&rsquo;s first 
black mayor, was supported by black voters in the hope that he might curtail the 
brutal racism of the city&rsquo;s police force, but in May 1985, within months of his 
election, he planned and authorized the notorious Osage Avenue bombing of MOVE, 
a black counter-cultural community;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> likewise, Tom Bradley, the black mayor of 
Los Angeles, found himself in stark opposition to much of the black community during 
the rebellion of 1992 (this can hardly be called a &ldquo;race riot,&rdquo; since even the police 
figures prove the multi-ethnic character of the rising).<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> Identity politics has 
also served to divide ethnic-minority workers against each other, encouraging them 
to compete over limited funds instead of questioning why there is not enough to 
provide for the needs of all. Finally, identity politics, and the fascination with 
identity in the humanities over the last two decades, can allow structural racism 
to be sidelined whenever different identities are taken as equals&mdash;hence the struggle 
over white studies, which soon became a celebration of &ldquo;white culture<span lang="en-us">&rdquo;</span> (although 
&ldquo;whiteness&rdquo; is, of course, neither biological nor cultural, but an ideological construction 
entrenching the economic privilege of some and encouraging others to imagine that 
they partake in that privilege, even though they do not reap the material benefits).<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> Krims need not disagree with any of this, but the centrality of &ldquo;identity&rdquo; to his 
project suggests that he attaches an importance to it that I would wish to question. 
Noel Ignatiev memorably described the banal endpoint of identity politics&mdash;the promotion 
of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; industry does not depend on small groups of well-intentioned 
  people meeting in church basements, but on lucrative contracts with corporations 
  to conduct seminars for executives on how to manage a &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; labor force. It 
  is fortunate that in the nineteenth century they had abolitionists instead of 
  diversity consultants; if not, slavery would still exist, and representatives 
  of slaves and slaveholders would be meeting together&mdash;to promote mutual understanding 
  and good feeling.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[16] While these matters are worthy of vigorous debate, my criticisms are not 
meant to detract from Krims&rsquo;s substantial achievement. Krims has by no means provided 
a general introductory text on hip-hop (this was clearly not his intention), but 
for anyone teaching a course unit that explores hip-hop in greater depth, or which 
is devoted entirely to hip-hop, Krims&rsquo;s work constitutes a valuable addition to 
the existing literature, and ought to be added immediately to the bibliography list 
of any such course. For hip-hop research, Krims&rsquo;s work is simply indispensable, 
and will doubtless serve as a benchmark for years to come among all researchers 
who engage directly with the musical aspects of hip-hop. Whether music theorists 
will take up Krims&rsquo;s proposals on subsuming their discipline within cultural studies 
remains to be seen, but at the very least he has initiated a rapprochement between 
the two.</p>

Press, 1977), offers a useful framework here: cultural practices can be emergent 
or residual, and in either case can function to reinforce the dominant culture, 
provide an alternative to it, or oppose it. Different communities may, of course, 
assign different functions to the emergent culture of hip-hop: gangsta rap may be 
seen as alternative and sometimes oppositional by its direct producers; as oppositional 
by white conservative fomenters of moral panic over rap; but the CEOs of the record 
companies that distribute it may see it ultimately as reinforcing the dominant culture 
by confirming stereotypes of criminality and entrenching misogyny.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">See bell hooks&rsquo;s incisive analysis, &ldquo;Gangsta Culture&mdash;Sexism and Misogyny,&rdquo; 
in hooks, 115&ndash;23.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">The comment, &ldquo;If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?,&rdquo; was taken out of context, and the fact that it was a common joke in black communities passed over. Clinton&rsquo;s immediate concern was to avoid being Hortonized by George Bush Sr., and Sistah Souljah&rsquo;s comment merely a convenient pretext.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">KRS-One in Boogie Down Productions&rsquo; &ldquo;The Bridge is Over&rdquo; from the celebrated 
and influential album, <i>Criminal Minded</i> (B-Boy Records, 1987).</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">Record companies&rsquo; desire for star vocalists had led to the demotion of DJs, 
and a series of law suits in the early 90s led to restrictions on the use of samples&mdash;fees 
now had to be paid to copyright holders in advance of a recording&rsquo;s release.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">KRS-One, &ldquo;MCs Act Like They Don&rsquo;t Know,&rdquo; <i>KRS-One</i> (Jive, 1995).</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">Krims discusses the particular predilection of reality rap for dissonant 
combinations of samples, or indeed combinations that are not in tune with each other, 
calling such textures the &ldquo;hip-hop sublime&rdquo; (in the original Burkean sense of inspiring 
fear and pleasure simultaneously). See pp. 73&ndash;74.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">Aside from all these considerations, Ice Cube&rsquo;s oppositional stance is blatantly 
obvious; this is not like the classic post-colonial studies task of putting one&rsquo;s 
ear to a Kipling text until the faint whimper of a resistant, Indian voice is heard.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">See pp. 25&ndash;27. Fordism is a system of industrial mass production of standardized 
products involving Taylorism (&ldquo;scientific management&rdquo; of labor), assembly lines,
