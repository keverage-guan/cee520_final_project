multidimensional scaling (MDS) was applied to the matrices of (dis)similarity 
ratings from six pitch-class set (pcset) similarity functions to see what types 
of constructs they actually measure. Three functions that use the interval-class 
vector (icv) for their computations (Scott and Isaacson&rsquo;s ANGLE, Isaacson&rsquo;s 
IcVSIM and ISIM2) and three that use subset imbedding (Castr&eacute;n&rsquo;s RECREL, Rahn&rsquo;s 
ATMEMB and AMEMB2) were studied. The ratings of these functions for all 
trichords, tetrachords, and pentachords (under Tn/I-equivalence) were examined; 
ratings for each cardinality of set-class separately as well as contiguously 
grouped together (3+4, 4+5, 3+4+5) were studied. Four-dimensional geometric 
solutions were found for the icv-based measures while five-dimensional solutions 
were found for the subset-based measures, based on goodness-of-fit analysis. The 
configurations show one dimension clearly interpretable as diatonicism vs. 
chromaticism; other dimensions indicate oppositions such as &rdquo;whole-tone&rdquo; vs. 
&rdquo;anti-wholetone&rdquo; or ic3- vs. 016-saturation. Still other dimensions are less 
clear as to good interpretations. The overall results
are generally consistent with the idea that these functions all measure 
constructs relating to familiar scales (diatonic, hexatonic, octatonic, etc.). 
The results are also compared with several systems of pcset genera. ISIM2 was 
found to be inconsistent with itself in terms of the geometries it produced. 
Several set-classes had coordinates near zero along various dimensions in the 
derived configurations, indicating that in a formal quantitative sense they do 
not possess the corresponding musical properties being measured; this may raise 
questions concerning the relative aesthetic worth of some such set-classes.</font></p>

<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Over thirty years after the publication of Allen Forte&rsquo;s 
<i>The Structure of Atonal Music</i> (<a href="#forte_1973" id="citation_forte_1973_67dc9b42878d9">Forte 1973</a>), music theorists working with 
pitch-class sets (henceforth, pcsets) still face a basic problem: how to assess 
the degree to which two set-classes are similar to each other. A variety of 
similarity measures have been proposed over the years, and arguments about the 
merits of these measures now occupy a number of journal pages.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Some 
fundamental questions remain unresolved by this discussion, however. First, what 
constitutes a &ldquo;really good&rdquo; measure of pcset similarity, one that mirrors our 
&ldquo;musical intuitions&rdquo;? Second, for the existing similarity measures, just 
precisely what musical properties <i>are</i> they measuring? </p>
<p>

[2] Attempts to address the 
former question head-on will get bogged down in arguments of philosophy, 
epistemology, and aesthetics, because the term &ldquo;pcset similarity&rdquo; as used in the 
vast majority of the literature has ultimately remained vague and 
nebulous--while we certainly have some intuitive notion of what we mean by the 
term, we have not expressed clearly what sorts of properties are involved.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
By contrast, the latter question is both aesthetically neutral--it is, as Sgt. 
Joe Friday would say, a case of &ldquo;Just the facts, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;--and readily amenable to 
analysis. Furthermore, once we have a detailed answer to it, we will be in a 
much better position to work on the former question. In other words, once we 
understand what specific musical constructs are actually being measured by 
various &ldquo;similarity measures,&rdquo; we will have a basis for discussing whether those 
constructs are relevant to our heretofore intuitive concept of &ldquo;pcset 
similarity,&rdquo; and whether other constructs should be included in a list of 
similarity criteria, or even replace some or all of those being rated by 
existing measures. </p>
<p>

[3] Some similarity 
measures--those that yield ratings for all possible comparisons, including 
between set-classes of different cardinality--generate tremendous amounts of 
data. Humans, however, are (perhaps fortunately) particularly ill-evolved to 
comprehend massive tables of numbers. This implies that applying numerical 
visualization techniques to the resulting data would be highly beneficial--to 
paraphrase the adage, a picture is worth a thousand data points. Such techniques 
have been developed over the last forty years in a family of computational 
methods called multidimensional scaling (MDS) and cluster analysis (CA); with 
computing power now ludicrously cheap, it makes sense to apply them to this 
problem.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[4] Some, intimately familiar with various 
similarity measures and the ratings they produce through years of working with 
them, might wonder, &ldquo;Why bother? Didn&rsquo;t Scott and Isaacson (1998) show that most 
similarity measures are derivable from each other? And as such, don&rsquo;t they all 
necessarily measure the same things? After all, the paper gives a table (page 117) 
showing high correlations between various measures&rsquo; ratings.&rdquo; There are several 
responses to this. First and foremost, Scott and Isaacson did not show how to 
derive all then-existing similarity measures from each other. It is in fact 
possible that some cannot be so derived, e.g., it is difficult to conceive how 
one might derive Castr&eacute;n&rsquo;s (<a href="#castr&eacute;n_1994" id="citation_castr&eacute;n_1994_67dc9b42878f4">1994</a>) highly recursive RECREL from a non-recursive 
measure. Such other measures might well rate entirely different similarity 
factors. Second, for those measures that were co-derivable, the transformations 
involved are non-linear; and as the burgeoning field of dynamical systems theory 
can attest, even simple non-linear transformations can generate substantially 
differing results. As a trivial example, the functions y = x, y = SQRT(x), and y = x<sup>2</sup> 
yield values that are highly correlated, yet their plots look quite 
different.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Without visualizing 
the graphs but only looking at the correlations, this would not be apparent. </p>
<p>

[5] In fact, correlations (as single, 
all-subsuming numbers for pairs of measures) do nothing to show what constructs 
might underlie the ratings being produced. For example, the measures &ldquo;number of 
steel-reinforced girders in a skyscraper S&rdquo; and &ldquo;square footage of office space 
in a skyscraper S&rdquo; do not appear <i>prima facie</i> to have anything to do with each 
other; yet they will always have a high positive correlation because they are 
both functions of the total volume of a skyscraper. The nature of such 
underlying constructs and their relationships to the &ldquo;surface features&rdquo; being 
measured might be extremely subtle and non-obvious. Geometric visualization and 
similar techniques can help us tease out underlying multiple components of 
similarity, and aid us in deciding whether we could simplify our models by 
deriving some factors from others.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> 
So, we might find that RECREL measures factors A, B, and C while some 
nonrecursive measure rates factors B and D; this in turn would suggest 
investigating whether factor D is some function of A or C, or whether all three 
are expressible in terms of factor E. At the least, we could discuss explicitly 
the relative worth of all those factors for measuring pcset similarity.</p>
<p>

[6] Finally, geometric 
visualization allows a &ldquo;reality check&rdquo; for similarity measures: there might be 
problems with a measure&rsquo;s numerical ratings that are not evident from inspection 
of them, or even from the measure&rsquo;s verbal description. In fact, I will show 
that there is at least one similarity measure that fails to be self-consistent 
in its resulting geometries across various domains, even though its raw 
numerical ratings are highly correlated with the ratings of other measures that 
<i>are</i> geometrically self-consistent. </p>
<p>

[7] The techniques of MDS/CA are likely 
unfamiliar to most music theorists. Therefore, in the first part of this article 
(paragraphs 8-23) I provide a brief and as non-technical as possible overview of 
several types of MDS/CA and some of the issues involved in their use.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
The 
overview is generic, so readers wishing for specific discussion about musical 
issues may skim or skip it at first, returning only when they have 
methodological questions about use of the method in a musical situation. In the 
second part (paragraphs 24-53), I apply MDS to six pcset similarity functions&rsquo; 
ratings for trichords through pentachords, to see what geometric structures they 
yield (the nouns &ldquo;function&rdquo; and &ldquo;measure&rdquo; henceforth will be considered 
interchangeable). Since my purpose here is simply to show what these functions 
measure and not to investigate <i>why</i> they do so, I shall not attempt any 
analysis of the underlying mathematics.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
In the final section (paragraphs 54 
ff.) I compare the MDS results with some proposed systems of pcset genera, and 
discuss some implications as to whether the factors measured by these functions 
&ldquo;match up with our musical intuitions.&rdquo; As part of that discussion, the MDS 
results raise a potentially controversial question: perhaps the creed that &ldquo;all 
set-classes are created equal(lly interesting musically)&rdquo; is false. </p>

<p>

[8] The basic idea behind MDS is very simple. 
Consider a map of a region with several cities marked on it. If the map is of 
reasonable quality, it is easy to derive from it the inter-city distance matrix, 
the set of &ldquo;as the crow flies&rdquo; distances between all pairs of cities on the map. 
(Some readers may already be thinking, what about the curvature of the earth? 
This is an excellent question, and will be discussed shortly.) The reverse 
problem--given an inter-city distance matrix, derive the relative locations of 
the cities--is rather more difficult. MDS is simply a numerical technique to 
solve this problem: the matrix is fed to a computer program that returns a plot 
of the relative positions of the cities and/or a set of coordinates for them. In 
general, we have a set of objects of analytical interest for which we have 
obtained ratings of relative distance or similarity for all possible pairs;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
an MDS analysis will yield a geometric configuration of the objects in some 
abstract (psychological) space, and interpretation of the dimensions of the 
resulting configuration is up to the researcher. (In the above mileage exercise, 
such interpretation would be trivial--we would simply need to find the 
north-south vs. east-west axes--but in general it is more complex.) Note that 
besides the obvious question of what the dimensions mean (tall-short? 
bright-dark? etc.), the researcher may have to consider how the configuration is 
oriented with respect to a pre-existing model they might be testing, since some 
types of MDS are result-invariant with respect to translation, rotation, and 
reflection about axes. 
<b>Figure 1</b> illustrates this point: all four 
cubes are the same configuration, but rotated or flipped around one or more 
axes. If the origins of the coordinate systems are located in the centers of the 
cubes, the objects in the different setups might appear to have very different

[9] As a simple application of MDS, consider
<b>Table 1</b>, which shows estimated distances in miles between a number of cities 
in New York State, derived from the American Automobile Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Driving 
Distances&rdquo; map for the state. (<b>Figure 
2a</b> is a hand-drawn plot of their approximate 
locations.) There is a very large amount of noise (errors) in the table. Only a 
few of the cities have directly listed driving distances on the AAA map so many 
of the numbers are extrapolations, or, in some cases, complete guesswork--in 
particular, nothing remotely resembling a straight-line drive exists from 
Ogdensburg and Plattsburgh, in the extreme north of the state, to nearly any of 
the other cities in the table. Even those values listed on the AAA map are for 
<i>driving</i> distances, and so may not be straight-line. Given the all-important 
computing maxim of &ldquo;Garbage In, Garbage Out,&rdquo; we might well expect that this 
exercise in <i>geographia speculativa</i> should result in nothing like reality. 
Nonetheless, the resulting MDS configuration (<b>Figure 
2b</b>) shows a recognizable if distorted plot of the various city locations. 
(The outline of the state was hand-drawn in afterwards.) </p>
<p>

[10] A derived 
geometric configuration may be surprising, given the physical makeup of the 
objects being investigated. For example, in an MDS analysis of color similarity 
data originally obtained by Ekman (<a href="#ekman_1954" id="citation_ekman_1954_67dc9b4287a26">1954</a>) the stimuli varied along exactly one 
dimension--the wavelengths of the lights for the colors--yet the program 
recovered the familiar two-dimensional structure of the color wheel. Researchers 
should thus be prepared to see more complex structure in the psychological space 
than they might think present given the stimuli structure. One example in music 
is the well-known result of Krumhansl and Kessler (<a href="#krumhansl_and_kessler_1982" id="citation_krumhansl_and_kessler_1982_67dc9b4287a29">1982</a>), which in essence 
verified Schoenberg&rsquo;s (<a href="#schoenberg_1954" id="citation_schoenberg_1954_67dc9b4287a2b">1954</a>) chart of key regions: the configuration of the 
distances between musical keys was seen to lie on a torus (donut-shape), a 
geometry that had been proposed by several other writers throughout history. The 
torus was in a space of four dimensions, not three, however;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
so our cognitive 
structuring of music is more subtle than we might believe at first.</p>
<p>

[11] The concept of MDS 
dates to the 1930s, but it was only with a paper by Shepard (<a href="#shepard_1962" id="citation_shepard_1962_67dc9b4287a2e">1962</a>) and two 
papers by Kruskal (<a href="#kruskal_1964a" id="citation_kruskal_1964a_67dc9b4287a30">1964a</a>, <a href="#kruskal_1964b" id="citation_kruskal_1964b_67dc9b4287a32">1964b</a>) that a practical numerical technique was 
described. This method, called nonmetric MDS for reasons that do not concern us, 
assumes that the distance or proximity values of the matrix are directly related 
by some unknown function to distances between the objects in some underlying 
abstract N-dimensional Euclidean space, whose distance metric is the generalized 
version of the formula familiar from Cartesian geometry, SQRT(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> + 
<nobr> . . . </nobr>).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
Because the underlying space is Euclidean, the &ldquo;true&rdquo; distances are 
all symmetric; asymmetries in the data are considered to be noise. Discrepancies 
between the actual data values and the derived underlying distances are 
accounted for in a goodness-of-fit measure called &ldquo;stress&rdquo;: as the number of 
dimensions increases, stress decreases, and choosing between configurations of 
different dimensionalities becomes an issue. Here is how the curvature of the 
earth comes into play in the example that opened this discussion: if our 
distance matrix is taken from a small geographic region (say, locations in the 
New York City metropolitan area), we can treat everything as lying on a 
Euclidean plane.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> If, however, 
we took the list of cities [New York, Vancouver, London, Buenos Aires, New 
Delhi, Tokyo, Wellington, Moscow, Nairobi<nobr> . . . </nobr>] and tried to fit the resulting 
distance matrix onto a flat surface, there would be a significant amount of 
stress (i.e., distortion) to any such solution--witness the history of 
cartography. By going to three dimensions, we will reduce the stress 
dramatically (and in fact should almost eliminate it except for residual amounts 
due to numerical round-off error, since the true geometry of the cities is 
three-dimensional).</p>
<p>

[12] Four broad issues arise. First, how do we 
determine the best dimensionality for a solution? Second, since in nearly all 
practical cases we take data from multiple subjects--the rule of thumb is that 
one needs a minimum of 30 subjects for reliability--and average their matrices 
together before running an analysis, how might we account for idiosyncrasies in 
their ratings (different subjects might selectively attend more significantly to 
certain features in the stimuli, skewing their ratings)? Third, what if there 
are possible inherent underlying asymmetries between the stimuli? (An obvious 
instance in music: in a context of functional tonality I-&gt;V will be rated rather 
differently than V-&gt;I.) Fourth and ultimately most importantly, how many objects 
can we study at one time without causing undue stress and fatigue to the 
subjects from whom we are collecting data? While I do not wish to downplay 
unduly the seriousness of the latter three questions, they are irrelevant for 
our purposes since we are concerned with results from abstract functions rather 
than human subjects. I shall therefore give only the briefest discussion of 
them. </p>
<p>

[13] To evaluate individual idiosyncrasies, there is an MDS model called INDSCAL that uses a set of multiple input matrices, one per subject, rather than 
a single averaged matrix. It permits finding a &ldquo;group stimulus space&rdquo; that shows 
a shared geometric configuration across all subjects, then gives a configuration 
of the different attentional weights that each subject gives per dimension to 
the stimuli. Thus, for a two-dimensional configuration a subject who attended 
equally to the features that correspond to the two dimensions would have their 
weight coordinates at (1.0, 1.0), while a subject who attended twice as much to 
the feature corresponding to the first dimension as to the second would have 
weight coordinates of (1.0, .5). </p>
<p>

[14] There are a number of models for dealing 
with possible asymmetries underlying the data. They have a fair bit of 
diversity; a brief mention of one, called ASCAL, will illustrate the general 
idea. ASCAL assumes that the underlying distances between the stimuli are still 
in some Euclidean space; for each component in the Euclidean distance formula, 
however, there is a weighting factor assigned to that dimension for every 
stimulus. So, for a two-dimensional configuration with N stimuli, 4N free 
parameters are being estimated: two each for the actual coordinates of the 
stimuli, and two for the dimensional weightings of each stimulus.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
</p>
<p>

[15] The issue of the maximum number of 
objects that can be studied at one time is sometimes called &ldquo;the data explosion 
problem.&rdquo; Simply put, in order to analyze N objects, ratings must be collected 
from every subject on N<sup>2</sup> pairs of objects. When taking data from humans, one 
quickly reaches a limit on the number of experimental trials they will be 
willing to endure (never mind satisfying committees that vett proposed 
experiments in terms of nationally-mandated guidelines for the ethical 
treatment of subjects). While there are ways to mitigate the resulting cognitive 
(and, eventually, physical) fatigue--breaking up data collection into multiple 
short sessions, and a higher rate of payment for subjects&rsquo; time per 
session--these only work so far. Such limits can be overcome a little more by 
some indirect methods (having each subject rate only a portion of the total 
number of pairs is one possibility), but then other types of limits (finding a 
sufficiently large pool of subjects, and obtaining sufficient funds to pay them 
all) come into play. Computers, fortunately, do not complain when asked to 
perform a few billion extra calculations, so the only way data explosion affects 
us is the limits of available software. </p>
<p>

[16] In assessing the proper 
dimensionality for a solution, it is important to minimize the number of 
dimensions, both for visualization purposes and for parsimony of explanation: 
why use three dimensions if two tell us almost everything of interest? If we add 
too many dimensions, there is eventually too much &ldquo;wiggle room&rdquo; within which to 
fit a solution and the algorithm can no longer derive a unique one.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
In most cases, long before this situation is reached we already hit a point 
where we are getting insufficient &ldquo;bang for the buck&rdquo; to justify the added 
complexity. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>

[17] Standard MDS unfortunately contains no test 
of statistical significance to evaluate whether adding one more dimension will 
give usefully more explanatory power. Some art in evaluation is thus needed. For 
a solution of a given dimensionality, we obtain two values: the stress factor 
mentioned earlier, and the percentage of the variability of the data being 
explained by the solution, a factor called &ldquo;r-squared&rdquo; (notated as <i>r<sup></i>2</sup>). One 
needs to plot the stress and <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> values for solutions of several 
dimensionalities and look for &ldquo;elbows&rdquo; (inflection points) in the plots. If an 
elbow exists, then by and large the higher-dimensional solutions are not giving 
significant additional explanation--the plot suddenly flattens out.  
<b>Figure 3</b> shows two examples of this. In the upper 
pair of plots stress drops precipitously from one to three dimensions then 
basically levels off, indicating that nothing more is being gained at higher 
dimensions. In the lower pair, the stress plot has no obvious elbow but the 
<i>r<sup></i>2</sup> plot does have one, indicating that for this data a 4-D solution is 
probably best. One must hope that one or both plots will have such elbows 
present. As another rule of thumb, to make reliable judgments about a 
configuration the number of objects should be at least 3-4 times greater than 
the highest anticipated dimensionality. If the number of objects is much below 
this factor, then there will likely be too few constraints on the configuration 
for it to be reliable.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[18] A poor fit can be caused by several factors, 
notably by underlying asymmetries in the data. Other problems are the presence 
of exemplars or prototypes in the set of objects being evaluated--in the set 
[apple, banana, cherry, fruit, kiwi, orange, watermelon], &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; will be almost 
certainly be considered more similar to all the other objects than any other 
pair to each other<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>--or if the dimensions involved are &ldquo;highly separable,&rdquo; 
i.e., have little or nothing to do with each other.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
The problem of separable 
dimensions in particular led Tversky and others (<a href="#tversky_1977" id="citation_tversky_1977_67dc9b4287a4b">Tversky 1977</a>; <a href="#tversky_and_gati_1982" id="citation_tversky_and_gati_1982_67dc9b4287a4d">Tversky and Gati 1982</a>; <a href="#tversky_and_hutchinson_1986" id="citation_tversky_and_hutchinson_1986_67dc9b4287a4f">Tversky and Hutchinson 1986</a>) to propose a different way to represent 
structure in psychological data, called cluster analysis (CA). There is a family 
of CA models, but they all work similarly: given a proximity or distance matrix, 
some method is used to pick the pair of objects most like each other, group them 
into a single cluster, and derive a new reduced matrix. When the process is 
finished, the objects will be grouped into a binary tree structure (exactly two 
branches descend from each node, and the objects are &ldquo;leaves&rdquo; at the termini of 
the final branches), where the distance between any pair of objects is related 
to the length of the path along the branches separating them. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 4</b>.

<p>

[19] Cluster analysis is certainly more 
appropriate than MDS for certain situations (e.g., when highly separable 
dimensions are involved); and even when MDS works for a given situation, CA can 
aid the researcher in interpreting an otherwise obscure set of dimensions. On 
the other hand, there are situations where CA gives extremely bad fits. If, for 
example, the underlying data structure forms a grid, any type of CA will yield a 
really bad fit since the only way to &ldquo;move&rdquo; between objects in the configuration 
is to traverse the tree connecting them.   
<b>Figure 4</b> shows an instance of this--visually, each object (open circle) 
is equidistant from its vertical or horizontal neighbors, but not at all along 
the tree (the filled squares are extra nodes generated by the tree-building 
procedure). The bottom line is, the researcher must be careful and explore many 
possibilities.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>

[20] A different type of 
issue can be termed &ldquo;robustness&rdquo;--whether changing the set of objects being 
compared alters the perceived/computed similarity between the original set of 
objects. Another example of cities on a map will illustrate. Take two distance 
matrices, one for just Toronto and its suburbs and the other for those 
plus various other cities across southern Ontario. If we run these two matrices 
through an MDS program and normalize the resulting configurations to each fit on 
an eight-by-ten color glossy photograph, the only change in the second 
configuration for the suburbs would be the percentage of area they 
occupied--they would still be at the same relative locations, with simply the 
scale changed. By contrast, the process of categorization and similarity 
judgment by humans is highly flexible and context-dependent. For example, 
consider in your own mind the similarities or differences in the set of animals 
[cat, cow, dog, moose]. Now consider the set [cat, cow, dog, moose, unicorn]: 
unicorns are large mammals like cows and moose, but mythical. Now consider 
instead the set [cat, cow, dog, moose, bonsai unicorn], where the bonsai unicorn 
looks just like its bigger counterpart but is the size of a chihuahua--does it 
now group closer to the small mammals? What about the set [cat, cow, dog, moose, 
turtle]? How about the set [cat, cow, dinosaur, dog, moose, small furry creature 
from Alpha Centauri, turtle, standard unicorn]? It is likely that your groupings 
may have altered rather considerably by the end. </p>
<p>

[21] Suppose we are presented 
with two functions Q and R that each purport to measure distances in southern 
Ontario. We use them to build distance matrices of the two lists of cities 
above, and examine the resulting MDS configurations. For the first case (only Toronto + suburbs), Q and R yield geometries that agree with each other and with 
the atlas; R also agrees with the atlas for the larger dataset. In Q&rsquo;s 
trans-Ontario configuration, however, some Toronto suburbs do not appear in 
their expected places: Scarborough (just east of the city) has migrated south 
and is sitting in downtown Buffalo, while Mississauga (immediately southwest of 
the city) has shifted eastwards some 200 km, into the middle of Lake Ontario. 
Geographical features such as cities are stationary (<i>pacite</i> Birnham Wood and 
James Blish&rsquo;s <i>Cities in Flight</i>), so we would likely view Q&rsquo;s usefulness as a 
distance metric with extreme skepticism, to say the least. It is in this sense 
of &ldquo;yields consistent relative MDS geometries, save for scaling, regardless of 
surrounding context&rdquo; that R is &ldquo;robust&rdquo; and Q is not. Given humans&rsquo; flexibility 
of similarity judgment, most MDS research is usually unconcerned with this 
issue: the flexibility and context-dependence is normally part of what is being 
investigated. This article, however, is examining formal, abstract functions, 
which do not (or, at least, should not) exhibit such subjectivity; it is 
therefore very much of importance. </p>
<p>

[22] In the abstract universe of pcsets, 
there is no external reality check like an atlas--this is, after all, why we are 
developing similarity measures--but we can at least demand geometric 
self-consistency from our functions. If function S yields different geometries 
than function T and each function is self-consistent, that suggests they are 
measuring different musical constructs and the situation warrants investigation. 
If on the other hand S behaves like function Q above, that strongly implies that 
we should not use it because there is no reason to have any faith in its 
ratings--all research on pcset similarity has (implicitly) assumed that pcsets 
are &ldquo;stationary&rdquo; objects. Note that it certainly should be possible, and perhaps 
highly desirable, to build a pcset similarity function that <i>is</i> 
context-sensitive in its calculations; but I am unaware that anyone has ever 
attempted to devise such a measure. In particular, none of the functions 
discussed in this essay incorporate context-dependence in their ratings. If we 
find a function that yields different relative locations of trichords if we 
consider trichords and tetrachords as a group vs. trichords in isolation, that 
is a serious red flag re the function. As mentioned in paragraph 6, it turns out 
that not all similarity measures pass this test. </p>

<p>

[23] The data obtained from 
humans in an MDS/CA study are inherently messy; this is why multiple subjects 
are needed to achieve reliability. Recently a different way to deal with this 
noisy data has been developed, called Probabilistic MDS (PMDS). Here it is still 
assumed that there is an underlying Euclidean geometry, but rather than being 
points in that space the objects are probability distributions like clouds. The 
centers of such clouds are what occur at the idealized object coordinates; but 
every similarity judgment is considered to be merely from somewhere within the 
cloud. (Such judgments of course have a higher probability of being from near 
the centers of the clouds, but this is not guaranteed.) Thus, each time a 
subject estimates the distance from object A to object B, their estimate will 
change (<b>Figure 
5</b>); the extent to 
which the estimates vary is a function of how &ldquo;spread out&rdquo; the clouds are along 
each dimension--the technical term is the degree of variance of the stimuli.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 
A PMDS program can do calculations for several scenarios: when all objects are 
assumed to have the same degree of variance for all dimensions, when the 
variance is the same for all objects for any given dimension but can be 
different for different dimensions, etc. Because PMDS also gives the variance 
for each dimension in the derived configuration, it is able to do significance 
testing for different dimensionalities. The price for this increased power is of 
course much more intractable math;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
PMDS is a technique still under development at this writing, and a present-day 
researcher should always run some non-probabilistic MDS model on their data as a 
reality check. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>PCSETS</b></p>
<p>

[24] Let us analyze some pcset similarity 
functions using MDS. Doing so yields two things. First, the resulting geometries 
will tell us something about what properties of pcsets the functions are 
measuring, since each dimension of the configurations involves different 
properties. Second, if the geometries produced by different functions match up 
save for rotation, translation, or reflection, then, given that such functions 
all purport to measure &ldquo;pcset similarity&rdquo; (whatever that is), it is reasonable 
to think that they are in fact either a) measuring the same constructs, whatever 
those might be, or b) measuring constructs that, while different, are themselves 
functions of some other underlying construct(s). For narrative simplicity, the 
above second item will be termed &ldquo;measuring the same thing(s),&rdquo; even though that 
phrase plays rather fast and loose with the situation. </p>
<p>

[25] Only such functions 
as give distinct proximity/distance ratings can be so evaluated; measures like 
Forte&rsquo;s (<a href="#forte_1973" id="citation_forte_1973_67dc9b4287aa2">1973</a>) Rn relations are binary so cannot generate a distance matrix for 
input. Other functions that yield multiple values but only permit comparisons 
between set-classes of the same cardinality, e.g., Teitelbaum&rsquo;s (<a href="#teitelbaum_1965" id="citation_teitelbaum_1965_67dc9b4287aa4">1965</a>) s.i., 
while evaluable to some degree by MDS, are still not very attractive--there is 
no way to say that the results of comparing tetrachords have anything to do with 
the results of comparing heptachords, for example. </p>
<p>

[26] For a reasonably-sized 
selection of functions I chose six, three of which--Scott and Isaacson&rsquo;s (<a href="#scott_and_isaacson_1998" id="citation_scott_and_isaacson_1998_67dc9b4287aa6">1998</a>) 
ANGLE, and Isaacson&rsquo;s (<a href="#isaacson_1990" id="citation_isaacson_1990_67dc9b4287aa8">1990</a>, <a href="#isaacson_1992" id="citation_isaacson_1992_67dc9b4287ab5">1992</a>) IcVSIM and (<a href="#isaacson_1996" id="citation_isaacson_1996_67dc9b4287ab7">1996</a>) ISIM2--use interval-class 
vector (henceforth, icv) content for their calculations, and three--Castr&eacute;n&rsquo;s 
(<a href="#castr&eacute;n_1994" id="citation_castr&eacute;n_1994_67dc9b4287ab9">1994</a>) RECREL, and Rahn&rsquo;s (<a href="#rahn_1979&ndash;80" id="citation_rahn_1979&ndash;80_67dc9b4287aba">1979&ndash;80</a>) ATMEMB and AMEMB2--that use subset 
content.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> Since RECREL uses Tn-rather than Tn/I-equivalence, only ratings 
between &ldquo;-A&rdquo; forms of asymmetrical set-classes (prime forms in the sense of 
<a href="#forte_1973" id="citation_forte_1973_67dc9b4287abe">Forte 1973</a>) were used for this study. Due to possible reflections/rotations 
between configurations, &ldquo;reference functions&rdquo; are needed against which other 
functions in a category can be compared; ANGLE and RECREL were declared to be 
the references for their respective categories on the basis of personal 
aesthetics. The domain to be studied was limited to trichords through 
pentachords (a total of 3160 distinct set-class pairings), for two reasons. 
First, it was within the limits of available software. Second, for the icv-based 
measures the ratings of a set-class and its complement are not independent;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup>the simplest way to avoid any possible resultant systemic problems was to 
eliminate hexachords <i>et al.</i> from consideration. </p>

corresponding <i>p</i>-values are the important things. </p>
<p>

[28] By definition, there is 
no noise in this data: the ratings are exactly what the functions compute for a 
pair of set-classes. Stress values in the analyses are therefore inherent for 
the configurations involved, in the sense that there are irreducible ambiguities 
in the computed ratings. Also by definition, the ratings matrices are all 
symmetrical; we can thus use the simplest MDS model, which is result-invariant 
with respect to axial reflection and rotation. This allows us to realign the 
configurations for the non-reference functions with respect to those for the 
references in order to compare them. The matrix manipulation technique to do so 
is called Procrustes rotation; named after the villain of Greek mythology, it is 
an algorithm that transforms a matrix so as to most closely align it with a 
given target matrix of equal size. The details of this process are irrelevant. 
</p>
<p>

[29] To examine the issue of robustness mentioned in paragraphs 20-22, the 
set-classes of each cardinality were analyzed in isolation as well as 
combinations of contiguous cardinalities. There were thus six datasets for each 
function. The following shorthand is used: </p>
<ul>
	<li>cardinality 3 alone: 3x3 dataset 
(12 set-classes) </li>
	<li>cardinality 4 alone: 4x4 dataset (29 set-classes) </li>
	<li>cardinality 5 alone: 5x5 dataset (38 set-classes) </li>
	<li>cardinalities 3 and 4: 3x4 
dataset (41 set-classes) </li>
	<li>cardinalities 4 and 5: 4x5 dataset (67 set-classes) </li>
	<li>cardinalities 3, 4, and 5: 3x5 dataset (79 set-classes) </li>
</ul>
<p>These were analyzed 
using SPSS, one of the most widely available statistical packages.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup>It would 
be extraordinarily tedious (and in fact unnecessary) to examine in detail all 
six datasets for all six functions; instead, I shall discuss only the results 
for the 3x5 dataset for the two reference functions ANGLE and RECREL, since it 
will be easiest to interpret the dimensions due to the wide range of objects 
involved.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup>Even so, the results may seem somewhat lengthy; as a guide, the 
order of discussion is as follows. First, the appropriate dimensionalities for 
the derived configurations are determined (paragraphs 30-34); next, the ANGLE 
and RECREL configurations for the 3x5 dataset are examined in detail (paragraphs 
35-42 and 43-48); third, those configurations are compared with the equivalent 
configurations for the other four functions via correlational analysis 
(paragraphs 49-51); finally, the robustness of the different functions for the 
various cardinalities is examined, also via correlations (paragraphs 52-53).</p>

<p>[30] Four-dimensional solutions 
were obtained for the icv-based functions, while five-dimensional ones were 
found for the subset-based functions. For readers new to MDS, the decision 
process is given in some detail as illustration; those already familiar with MDS 
or who want to cut to the chase can skip to paragraph 35, although they should 
be aware that some peculiarities exist and will be mentioned later on. </p>

<p>[31] 
<b>Table 3</b> gives the stress and <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> values for different 
dimensionalities by function for the 3x5 dataset, since discussion will focus on 
it; <b>Figures 6a</b> and
<b>6b</b> plot these 
values for the subset-based and icv-based functions respectively. For RECREL, as 
we increase from two to six dimensions we see incremental improvements in <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> 
of .0845 (from 2-D to 3-D), .0685 (from 3-D to 4-D), .0516 (from 4-D to 5-D), 
and then a sudden drop to .0154 (from 5-D to 6-D). For ANGLE, as we go from two 
to five dimensions we see incremental improvements in <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> of .1206 (from 2-D 
to 3-D), .14 (from 3-D to 4-D), and then down to .0285 (from 4-D to 5-D). Those 
sudden drops in incremental improvement are the elbow points indicating optimal 
dimensionalities. </p>
<p>[32] There are several oddities in Table 3. For the icv-based 
functions, the incremental improvement in <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> <i>increases</i> in going from 3-D to 
4-D vs. going from 2-D to 3-D. We thus have a set of &ldquo;reverse elbows&rdquo; at 3-D; 
these are apparent (albeit somewhat subtly) on the plots in Figure 6b. Also, the 
stress values suddenly drop to essentially zero and the <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> values jump up to 
1.000 (meaning all variability in the data is explained) at five dimensions for 
IcVSIM and ISIM2; this phenomenon occurs for them in all except the 3x3 dataset. 
The latter situation is an absolute indicator of too many dimensions: there is 
no stress because there are insufficient constraints on the configurations. 
Meanwhile, reverse elbows usually indicate that a calculation became trapped in 
a local minimum, and that a configuration should be recomputed--one typically 
uses the configuration from the next higher dimensionality (minus the extra 
dimension) as an input seed. For these functions, however, doing so does not 
change things: something else is involved. The reason will be seen in a few 
paragraphs. </p>
<p>[33] Although the stress/<i>r<sup></i>2</sup> values for the other datasets have 
not been shown, those datasets still have an issue of reliability regarding the 
configurations for the 3x3 and 4x4 datasets due to the small number of data 
points involved; this must be considered in determining the proper 
dimensionality for them. It is in fact not possible to compute a 6-D solution 
for the 3x3 dataset because the number of parameters to be derived (72, 6 
coordinates each for 12 set-classes) exceeds the number of data values (66, the 
number of similarity ratings). For the 3-D, 4-D, and 5-D solutions for that 
dataset, the numbers of parameters to be derived (36, 48, and 60) are still high 
compared to the number of data values, so those configurations are also 
questionable. For the 4x4 dataset, the 6-D solution also has a reliability issue 
(174 parameters vs. 406 data values). The incremental improvements in stress and 
<i>r<sup></i>2</sup> for both those datasets do mirror the patterns seen for the larger 
datasets, however. Since we cannot increase the number of objects in these 
datasets, we must assume that our decisions for appropriate dimensionality for 
the larger datasets carry over to these smaller ones. </p>
<p>[34] We are left with the 
prospect of examining four-and five-dimensional geometries. Visualization of 
more than three dimensions is typically difficult for humans;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> 
furthermore, even if we were to examine only three dimensions&rsquo; worth of the 
configurations at a time, the pictures would be far too crowded at their centers 
to understand any structure involved. By definition of a Euclidean space, 
however, each dimension in the configurations is independent of the others. We 
can thus examine the ordering of set-classes along each dimension separately to 
interpret what that dimension represents. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>ANGLE</b></p>
<p>[35] The order of dimensions produced by SPSS is arbitrary, so there is no need to adhere to it in the following 
discussion. Also, rather than repeatedly referring to &ldquo;dimension one,&rdquo; etc., I 
shall use my suggested interpretations for the dimensions as descriptive names. 
Thus, the phrase &ldquo;the ic1/ic5 dimension&rdquo; is a narrative shorthand for &ldquo;the 
dimension to which I am assigning an interpretation of &lsquo;an opposition of 
ic1-saturation vs. ic5-saturation&rsquo;,&rdquo; and so forth. For each dimension, the 
coordinates of the set-classes along the dimension are given plus a histogram 
for visualization. The units for the coordinates are also arbitrary, although 
they are on the same scale for all dimensions of a particular configuration. 
</p>

<p>[36] The most dramatic dimension has the easiest interpretation: ic1-saturation 
vs. ic5-saturation. The histogram in    
<b>Figure 7</b> shows a symmetrical distribution, with [012], its direct 
supersets, and other ic1-dominant set-classes at one extreme, while [027] and 
other diatonic subsets are at the opposite end. Most striking, though, is the 
clustering near zero of 37 set-classes, with large gaps between it and the other 
groups. </p>
<p>[37] This huge cluster explains the oddities in the stress/<i>r<sup></i>2</sup> tables. 
In the typical case when a configuration is one or more dimensions beyond 
optimum, one finds that for some of the dimensions almost all of the coordinate 
values will be at or near zero. Such an occurrence provides an additional 
dimensionality check, since it usually indicates that we are learning too little 
additional information to warrant the extra dimension. At first glance this 
looks to have happened here. </p>
<p>[38] In reconsidering whether a 4-D solution is 
appropriate, several factors must be weighed. First, the stress and <i>r<sup></i>2</sup> values 
show a non-trivial incremental improvement from 3-D to 4-D, arguing that the 
fourth dimension in the solution is a real one. Second, 42 of the 79 set-classes 
have non-zero coordinates, and some of those coordinates are decidedly non-zero. 
If this were a &ldquo;fake dimension&rdquo; we would expect fewer non-zero coordinates, and 
expect those to be closer to zero instead of being clearly grouped towards the 
extremes. Third, this dimension has a clear and logical interpretation, whereas 
the situation in the 3-D solution (omitted for space considerations) is 
muddled--as mentioned in footnote 14, judgment calls are sometimes necessary. 
Finally, the 5-D solution for RECREL has an almost exact counterpart to this 
dimension, and its stress/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> values showed no oddities. This last admittedly 
risks being an example of circular reasoning: if we are trying to determine 
whether these functions measure the same things, we should not use the results 
from one function to decide that the results of another are valid then go back 
to check what the former measures compared to the latter. I will argue in 
paragraph 48, however, that ic1-saturation vs. ic5-saturation is equivalent to 
[012]-saturation vs. [027]-saturation; if two different functions, one examining icv content and the other subset content, find these oppositions in their 
respective domains, then we should consider the result legitimate. </p>
<p>[39] The 
presence of certain set-classes in the near-zero clump may seem surprising. For 
example, 4-10 and 4-11, [0135] and [0235] respectively, are in the clump yet are 
both diatonic subsets. They do not, however, exhibit relative ic5-saturation. 
All of the set-classes in the clump have equal ic1 and ic5 content; the first 
few set-classes with significantly non-zero coordinates have ic1 content one 
more than ic5 content or vice versa; and the set-classes at the extremes have 
either zero ic5 or ic1 content while the value of the opposite is at least two, 
and have zero values for at least one other icv component. This dimension thus 
provides a graphic (in both senses of the word) example of how to quantitatively 
clarify one aspect of pcset similarity: what the terms &ldquo;diatonic&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;chromatic&rdquo; really signify, as measured by certain abstract functions. </p>

<p>[40] The 
next dimension can be termed &ldquo;016-saturation vs. ic3-saturation&rdquo; or &ldquo;even 
distribution around the pitch-chroma wheel vs. pitch-classes clumped at opposite 
sides of the chroma wheel.&rdquo; At one extreme in the histogram in     
<b>Figure 8</b> are [016] and [0167], 
followed closely by other sets with imbedded 016s, such as [0156]. Any other 
similar set-classes will necessarily increase the amount of ic5 and ic1 
simultaneously; thus, set-classes like [015] also group at this end of the 
dimension. At the other end are the diminished triad and the diminished seventh 
chord. Because the addition of any other pitch-classes would add ics other than 
ic3/ic6, there is a wide gap between those two set-classes and the others at 
this end, and the distribution along this dimension is asymmetrical. There is 
still a fairly large clump of set-classes at near-zero coordinates, although 
less so than in the ic1/ic5 dimension (only 25 of 79 here). This also 
contributes to the oddities of the stress/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> table. </p>
<p>[41] The third dimension 
is characterizable as &ldquo;whole-toneness vs. anti-whole toneness.&rdquo; The distribution 
histogram in      
<b>Figure 9</b> is again asymmetrical. At one extreme are the seven 
subsets of the whole-tone scale, followed by a large gap; at the other extreme, 
we again see [016] and [0167], also with a wide gap between them and the next 
set-classes; but among that group are [036] and [0369]. Evidently for ANGLE, if 
&ldquo;whole-tone&rdquo; means &ldquo;saturation in ic2 and ic4 together,&rdquo; then &ldquo;anti-wholetone&rdquo; 
can mean either ic3- or 016-saturation. </p>
<p>[42] The last dimension in the ANGLE 
configuration has the most even distribution and is harder to interpret. At the 
positive end of the histogram in      
<b>Figure 10</b> are hexatonic subsets--the augmented triad and its 
supersets [0148] and [01458]--followed by other pcsets with relatively high 
ic4-content and zero or minimal ic2- and ic6-content. In contrast, the negative 
extreme has a seemingly confusing mix of whole-tone ([024], [0246]), diatonic 
([0257]) and chromatic or near-chromatic ([013], [0123]) set-classes. The 
hexatonic scale has the characteristic &ldquo;ic4-saturation at the expense of ic2 and 
ic6 content,&rdquo; so the best interpretation for the negative end of the dimension 
appears to be the opposite, i.e., &ldquo;attempts at ic2-saturation at the expense of 
ic4 and/or ic6.&rdquo; Since it is impossible to have any ic2 content in set-classes 
of cardinality three or higher without having some other ics present, we get the 
&ldquo;mixed bag&rdquo; of set-classes here. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>RECREL</b></p>
<p>[43] As mentioned, RECREL has an almost 
exact counterpart to ANGLE&rsquo;s ic1 vs. ic5 dimension--here better labeled 
&ldquo;012-saturation vs. 027-saturation.&rdquo; The coordinates and histogram in       
<b>Figure 11</b> 
are somewhat different, 
but the units are arbitrary anyway. The signs are backwards, but they are also 
arbitrary; by reversing one configuration and comparing the set-class orderings, 
as shown in       
<b>Figure 12</b>, it is clear how closely the two 
match up. The three set-classes at the extremes match in order; there follows a 
group of three set-classes whose orders almost match; a single set-class that 
matches; another group of three that almost match up; then a group of eleven; 
and then the near-zero cluster. </p>

<p>[44] The next dimension corresponds to ANGLE&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;whole-tone vs. anti-whole tone&rdquo; dimension, although not quite so exactly. At 
the positive extreme of the histogram in        
<b>Figure 13</b> are the seven whole-tone subsets, just as for 
ANGLE; beyond those, however, the orderings diverge somewhat. For the ANGLE 
configuration, general high ic4 content seemed to come next; here, high 
024-content apparently takes precedence. This end of the dimension thus seems to 
be more strictly &ldquo;024-saturation.&rdquo; At the negative end, the three set-classes 
at the extreme also match, but after that set-classes with higher 016- than 
036-content seem to take slight precedence: there are three set-classes before 
we reach the diminished triad and seventh chord, vs. one for ANGLE. A full 
interpretation therefore appears to be &ldquo;024-saturation vs. 016-/036-saturation.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p>[45] The next dimension bears some resemblance to ANGLE&rsquo;s &ldquo;hexatonic vs. ic2&rdquo; 
dimension, but again has differences. At the negative end in the histogram of 
<b>Figure 14</b> are 
the augmented triad and [0148], as for ANGLE. The augmented triad is much more 
of an outlier here, however; and after those two set-classes the orderings 
diverge. Here, various pcsets with high 014-content follow, although the 
diatonic/diminished triads and the diminished seventh chord also appear. The 
set-classes at the opposite end of this dimension all lack ic4 content, but the 
pairings that occur are striking: [012] and [027] are farthest out, followed by 
their immediate supersets [0123] and [0257]; a bit further in are the next level 
of supersets, [01234] and [02479]. This dimension thus appears to be 
&ldquo;04/014-saturation vs. 012/027-saturation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>[46] The remaining two dimensions 
correspond much less if at all to dimensions in the ANGLE configuration; this is 
not surprising since this is a five-dimensional solution instead of a 
four-dimensional one. As shown in        
<b>Figure 15</b>, the next dimension has the diminished triad and 
seventh chord at its positive extreme, leading to an interpretation of 
&ldquo;036-content.&rdquo; The negative end would appear to have &ldquo;015-content&rdquo; as its 
primary characteristic, since [015] and [0156] are the two set-classes at that 
extreme, and [015] is very much an outlier. The third set-class in is [048], 
however, and other set-classes with high ic4-content, such as [0148], take 
precedence over those with 015-content. ([014] has a near-zero coordinate, so 
this is not about 014-content.) The distribution along the histogram is much 
more even than in the previous dimensions; this may indicate some sort of 
conflict between these two characteristics, so that one does not take clear 
precedence after the extremum. This dimension is thus apparently &ldquo;015/04-content 
vs. 036-content.&rdquo; </p>
<p>[47] The final dimension for RECREL is the most difficult to 
understand, and a good, solid interpretation in terms of trichord content is 
elusive. There are no clear outliers at the negative extreme, and the 
distribution on the histogram in         
<b>Figure 16</b> is very even. There is again a potpourri of 
set-classes; their only common characteristic is a lack of ic6. At the positive 
end, we have various set-classes with ic6-content and no ic3-content. The two 
most extreme set-classes are [016] and its direct superset [0167], followed by 
[026] and <i>its</i> direct superset [0268]; but there is no real separation between 
the latter pair and the rest of the pack. The diminished triad and seventh chord 
do occur near this end and they of course have high ic3 content; but they also 
have relatively high ic6 content. The best interpretation for this dimension 
thus appears to be &ldquo;016/026-content at the expense of ic3 vs. depletion of 
ic6.&rdquo; Note that this is not an analogue to ANGLE&rsquo;s 016/ic3 dimension because 
[036] and [0369] were at the opposite extreme from [016]/[0167] in the latter. 
</p>
<p>[48] If we consider those dimensions where ANGLE and RECREL appear to give the 
same results, we see situations where ic-saturation and subset-saturation are 
in a sense equivalent. In other words, if we try to maximize ic1, we perforce 
will be led to [012], [0123], etc.; a subset-based measure that views 
012-saturation as one aspect of pcset similarity must then yield the same sort 
of results for that dimension, and a similar line of reasoning applies to 
ic5/027-content. This says nothing about <i>why</i> R RECREL views 012-content as one 
aspect of similarity while not viewing, e.g., 013-content (which would lead 
towards an &ldquo;octatonic vs. whatever&rdquo; dimension) as another aspect; it merely 
explains why it should yield somewhat similar factors as an icv-based function 
in some situations. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>The Other Functions</b></p>
<p>[49] As noted in paragraph 28, to 
analyze the other functions for the 3x5 dataset we first apply Procrustes 
rotation to their configurations so as to most closely align them with those of 
the reference functions. We then examine correlations of the dimensional 
coordinates between the two triples of functions. If IcVSIM and ISIM2 measure 
the same things as ANGLE, corresponding dimensions (e.g., dimension 1 for ANGLE 
and IcVSIM--we do not care here whether this is the ic1/ic5 dimension or 
whatever) should be highly correlated while non-corresponding dimensions 
(dimension 2 for ANGLE vs. dimension 3 for IcVSIM) should have little or no 
correlation; the same situation should hold true for RECREL, ATMEMB and 
AMEMB2.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> It is then only 
necessary to consider any dimensions in the other functions where this does not 
hold. </p>

<b>Table 4</b> gives the 
correlations for all dimensions of the 4-D solutions for the icv-based 
functions, and likewise for the 5-D solutions for the subset-based measures, for 
the 3x5 dataset. The subset-based functions show the expected situation if these 
functions all measure the same things: values on the main diagonal 
(corresponding dimensions) are all extremely high, while the other values are 
all very low. Recall that the notation &ldquo;<i>p&lt;</i>.001&rdquo; means a probability of less 
than one in a thousand that the observed result might have occurred by chance; 
conversely, &ldquo;<i>p</i>&gt;&gt;.05&rdquo; says there is well over a 5% probability that the results 
are due to chance.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p>
<p>[51] The same situation 
holds for ANGLE and IcVSIM, but there are exceptions for ISIM2: ANGLE/IcVSIM 
dimensions two (the 016 vs. ic3 dimension) have significant negative 
correlations with ISIM2 dimension three (its hexatonic vs. ic2 dimension), at 
<i>p&lt;</i>.01 each; and ANGLE dimension three (hexatonic vs. ic2) has a significant 
negative correlation with ISIM2 dimension two (016 vs. ic3) at <i>p&lt;</i>.05. (IcVSIM&rsquo;s 
hexatonic-vs.-ic2 and ISIM2&rsquo;s 016-vs.-ic3 dimensions &ldquo;just miss&rdquo; being 
correlated at <i>p</i>&lt;.05.) Also, for some pairs of corresponding dimensions in some 
of the other datasets (omitted for space), ISIM2 has essentially no correlation 
to ANGLE and IcVSIM (<i>r</i>s are near-zero). This would suggest that ISIM2 measures 
something different than the latter two functions and should be examined in 
detail; however, ISIM2 turns out to be non-robust. As a result, it is pointless 
to compare it with the other icv-based functions. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Robustness</b></p>
<p>[52] Here, recall, 
the concern is the self-consistency of a function&rsquo;s set-class orderings along 
each dimension across several datasets. For example, trichords occur in the 3x3, 
3x4, and 3x5 datasets. The coordinates for trichords in the 3x4 and 3x5 
configurations must be extracted from them and compared to the coordinates for 
the 3x3 dataset. This means subjecting the extracted sub-configurations to Procrustes rotation with the 3x3 configuration as target (because configurations 
for the other datasets might be reflected and/or rotated about axes), then 
computing correlations for corresponding dimensions for the various datasets; an 
equivalent procedure applies for tetrachords and pentachords. If the coordinates 
for set-classes of a cardinality for a particular dimension are highly 
correlated across all the datasets involved, then we can conclude that the 
function is stable and robust for that cardinality with respect to that 
dimension--the set-classes occur in approximately the same relative ordering 
regardless of where set-classes of other cardinalities occur along that 
dimension.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup></p>

<p>[53] All of the functions except 
ISIM2 are extremely robust for all dimensions. Except for two correlations for 
AMEMB2 at .904 and .915, all <i>r</i>s for the other five functions are greater than 
.96, and nearly all are greater than .99--<i>p</i>&lt;.001 for all cases. By contrast, 
ISIM2 fails to be robust at <i>p</i>&lt;.05 in several cases. It is not necessary for us 
to analyze these inconsistencies; that they exist already renders the function 
unusable for this essay&rsquo;s purposes. For those wishing to investigate these cases 
on their own,   
<b>Table 5</b> gives the correlation matrices 
for ISIM2&rsquo;s non-robust cardinalities and dimensions, and lists the coordinate 
values for each of the configurations or Procrustes-rotated subconfigurations 
for those dimensions.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> The titles &ldquo;Dimension 2&rdquo;, etc. reflect the order of 
dimensions from SPSS for the &ldquo;base&rdquo; datasets (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5, as appropriate) 
involved. The interpretations given are likewise for the base dataset for each 
particular cardinality/dimension, so do not necessarily match anything in the 
prior discussions for ANGLE and RECREL; as noted in footnote 24, such 
interpretations are generally rather tentative due to the smaller number of 
objects in those datasets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Pcset genera</b></p>
<p>[54] The various dimensions of the 
ANGLE and RECREL configurations show two types of organizations: either 
different ways of attempted symmetrical distribution of pitch-classes, or 
symmetrical vs. asymmetrical distributions. Thus, the diatonic set-classes 
evenly distribute pcs by ic5, while chromatic organization tries <i>not</i> to 
distribute evenly but rather bunch all pcs up in one section of the chroma 
circle via ic1 saturation. Several of these organization types correspond to 
group-theoretic ways of distributing pcs around the chroma circle according to 
the concept of maximal evenness (<a href="#clough_and_douthett_1991" id="citation_clough_and_douthett_1991_67dc9b4287b2b">Clough and Douthett 1991</a>). As Quinn (<a href="#quinn_2001" id="citation_quinn_2001_67dc9b4287b2d">2001</a>) 
also points out, the chromatic, whole-tone, octatonic, hexatonic, and diatonic 
scales correspond to Hanson&rsquo;s (<a href="#hanson_1960" id="citation_hanson_1960_67dc9b4287b2f">1960</a>) idea of interval cycles, with each of those 
having ics 1 through 5 respectively dominant; and 016/0167 organization 
corresponds to Hanson&rsquo;s ic6 interval cycle. The notion of different kinds of 
pcsets at the extremes of the dimensions invites comparison with various models 
of pcset families, or genera. </p>
<p>[55] The <i>Oxford Shorter English Dictionary</i> 
defines <i>genus</i> as &ldquo;a class of things containing a number of subordinate classes 
(called species) with certain common attributes.&rdquo; In certain fields, most 
notably biology, genus membership is exhaustive and exclusive: every species 
belongs to exactly one genus. For other fields such as categories of games, the 
boundaries are not clear-cut--games can have characteristics that arguably 
render them members of more than one genus. In terms of mathematical, not 
musical, set theory, the former situation corresponds to classical sets: an 
object is either a member of a set or it is not, and the truth value of the 
proposition &ldquo;X belongs to set Y&rdquo; is 1 or 0 (true or false in classical logic). 
The latter situation corresponds to Zadeh&rsquo;s (<a href="#zadeh_1965" id="citation_zadeh_1965_67dc9b4287b31">1965</a>) fuzzy sets, which let one say 
&ldquo;X sort of belongs to Y,&rdquo; and where the truth value of &ldquo;X belongs to Y&rdquo; can be 
any real number from 0 to 1 inclusive (i.e., a probability value). </p>
<p>[56] Implicit 
in the definition of genus, whether classical or fuzzy, is the notion that some 
sort of criteria exist for exclusion as well as inclusion. A genus is defined to 
provide a distinction between objects that belong to it and those that do not; a 
genus whose inclusion rule is so broad and liberal as to permit <i>any</i> object of 
the domain to be a member is not useful. Likewise for a system of genera, 
significant overlap in members, even if no genus is all-inclusive, limits the 
system&rsquo;s utility. This is not to say that there can be no doubtful 
classifications, since some objects really may be best described as belonging to 
multiple genera; but it would seem a good rule of thumb that such objects should 
be a decided minority. </p>
<p>[57] Like similarity functions, multiple genera systems 
have been proposed; some explicitly come out of pcset theory or investigations 
influenced by it (e.g., <a href="#ericksson_1986" id="citation_ericksson_1986_67dc9b4287b32">Ericksson 1986</a>; <a href="#forte_1988" id="citation_forte_1988_67dc9b4287b34">Forte 1988</a>; <a href="#parks_1989" id="citation_parks_1989_67dc9b4287b36">Parks 1989</a>; <a href="#quinn_1997" id="citation_quinn_1997_67dc9b4287b37">Quinn 1997</a>, 
<a href="#quinn_2001" id="citation_quinn_2001_67dc9b4287b39">2001</a>) while others do not (e.g., Hanson, 1960; Harris, 1989; Hindemith, 1937/42; 
Wolpert, 1951, 1972). It is beyond the scope of this article to compare all of 
the various genera systems with the factors found to be measured by the 
similarity functions studied here. It is possible, though, to look at a sample: 
the systems of Forte, Parks, and Quinn provide an interesting set of contrasting 
approaches. </p>
<p>[58] Forte (1988) proposed a system of 12 genera, each generated by 
one or more trichord progenitors (the trichords are not actually members of the 
genera); Forte also lists four &ldquo;supragenera&rdquo; as a classification level above 
these. There are tremendous overlaps between the genera: while 17 of the 29 
tetrachords belong to only one genus, only one pentachord and no hexachords are 
singular to a genus. Most set-classes in fact belong to many genera: 29 out of 
38 pentachords belong to between 4 and 9 genera, and 6 of 35 hexachords belong 
to 11(!) genera.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> This situation strongly implies that Forte&rsquo;s system is a 
very poor set of genera in the usual sense (classical or fuzzy) of the term; a 
much better and more accurate label would appear to be &ldquo;interlocked network of 
complexes of set-classes.&rdquo; Given Forte&rsquo;s emphasis on families of supersets and 
the associated K/Kh-relations in his 1973 work, this is not surprising. Because 
of the membership overlaps and extreme blurring of boundaries among Forte&rsquo;s 
groups, it is not practical to try to determine any correspondences between his 
system and the MDS configurations. </p>
<p>[59] Parks (1989) developed his system for the 
analysis of Debussy&rsquo;s music. While he says he was explicitly coming out of the 
tradition of pcset theory, he is concerned with reflecting one musician&rsquo;s actual 
compositional palette rather than developing a scheme <i>ab initio</i>.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> He posits 
five genera, four of which correspond to familiar scales (diatonic, whole-tone, 
chromatic, and octatonic). His fifth genus, termed by him the &ldquo;8-17/18/19 
complex,&rdquo; is unwieldy: nearly every set-class in the domain of the present 
article belongs to it, with only 5-1 and 5-35 absent. This suggests that it is 
not useful as a genus <i>per se</i>--Parks&rsquo; own name, &ldquo;complex,&rdquo; implies as 
much--and it is omitted from further consideration here. Of his remaining 
genera, the diatonic and octatonic are still fairly obese--the former contains 9 
trichords/13 tetrachords/10 pentachords, while the latter has 7 trichords/13 
tetrachords/7 pentachords--but the situation is nowhere near as bad as for the 
8-17/18/19 complex.</p>
<p>[60] There is excellent correspondence between 
Parks&rsquo; whole-tone/chromatic genera and the equivalent groups in the MDS 
configurations. The seven whole-tone set-classes in the ANGLE-RECREL WT/anti-WT 
dimension match exactly the trichords through pentachords in Parks&rsquo; genus; for 
the chromatic genus, the seven set-classes at the extremes in the configurations 
omit 5-2 and 5-3 ([01235] and [01245]) and add 3-3, [014], as compared to Parks&rsquo; 
group of eight.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> The seven 
set-classes at the extreme diatonic end of the MDS configurations are in Parks&rsquo; 
diatonic genus, but that genus includes a number of set-classes that occur in 
the near-zero clump in the configurations. The five set-classes at the ic3 
extreme in the MDS configurations ([036], [0236], [0258], [0369], and [01369]) 
are all members of Parks&rsquo; octatonic genus; not much more can be said, because of 
both the obesity of Parks&rsquo; genus and the lack of a good secondary cutoff value 
for the configurations.</p>

<p>[61] In his 1997 presentation, Quinn used cluster analysis to examine the 
ratings of a large number of similarity functions for trichords and tetrachords. 
In comparing the resulting trees he found a good deal of correspondence among 
the various measures, something not unexpected given the present results. Quinn 
decided the trees could be parsed into eight large clusters (i.e., genera), but 
a number of set-classes were borderline: several &ldquo;fence sitters&rdquo; (my term) 
belonged to not just two but multiple groups, and [0135] in particular was 
listed as belonging to five groups. Because of this, Quinn argued strongly for a 
fuzzy set theory of pcset similarity.    
<b>Table 6</b> reproduces his list of groups from that presentation. </p>
<p>[62] In his 2001 
paper, a rather substantial modification of the earlier work, Quinn presented 
several more cluster analyses on trichords through hexachords as rated by 
different functions. He also carried out a very interesting Monte Carlo 
analysis<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> to determine networks of relationships between set-classes of 
various cardinalities, as measured by several functions. In the paper he gives 
two examples, one for tetrachords as rated by Morris&rsquo; (1979-80) ASIM, and one 
for hexachords as rated by ATMEMB. He finds six clusters of set-classes in the 
former and seven in the latter. The set-classes within each cluster have 
moderate to very strong connections with other cluster members, while the 
connections between groups are much weaker or nonexistent. </p>
<p>[63] Quinn&rsquo;s 
Monte Carlo results show an interlocked network of pcset clusters; in that sense 
they are more like Forte&rsquo;s system than Parks&rsquo;. His clusters are much more 
successful as a system of genera than Forte&rsquo;s, though, because his method allows 
quantitative cutoff values that circumscribe cluster membership and demonstrate 
the relative strengths of connections between pcsets both intra- and 
inter-cluster. In his analysis of hexachords as rated by ATMEMB, for example, 
when only the one percent most similar pcsets are used to develop connections 
between set-classes he gets strongly connected but essentially isolated 
clusters. As the cutoff value is liberalized to include the five percent and 
then ten percent most similar pcsets, the weaker connections between the 
clusters appear while connections within each cluster are strengthened, and the 
intra-cluster connections become more differentiated. This subtle distinction is 
missing in Forte&rsquo;s complexes, although one could envision Quinn&rsquo;s network 
perhaps asymptotically approaching Forte&rsquo;s in amounts of cross-connection if a 
sufficiently liberal cutoff value were used. The six ASIM tetrachord clusters 
correspond to Hanson&rsquo;s interval cycles and thus to components of the present 
results. Six of the seven ATMEMB hexachord clusters also correspond to the 
interval cycles while group B, containing [023457] and ten other set-classes, 
does not; perhaps significantly, it is the group most interconnected to all the 
other clusters. </p>
<p>[64] It would be far beyond the scope of this article to attempt 
a detailed comparison of the present results and the wide-ranging theory put 
forth in Quinn&rsquo;s (2004) dissertation, but it is possible to give a brief taste. 
In his third chapter, &ldquo;A Generalized Theory of Affinities,&rdquo; Quinn connects a set 
of properties first described by Lewin (1959), and termed &ldquo;Fourier properties&rdquo; 
in Lewin (2001), to the general mathematical theory of chord quality he has been 
developing. For example, a chord has Fourier property six--FOURPROP(6) in Lewin 
(2001), &ldquo;the whole-tone property&rdquo; in Lewin (1959)--if it has &ldquo;the same number of 
notes in one whole-tone set as it has in the other.&rdquo; Of the set-classes studied 
here, [0167] and [0369] possess this property while the whole-tone subsets do 
not. (Quinn provides a set of &ldquo;balance scale&rdquo; illustrations in his discussion; 
in that view, [0167] and [0369] are &ldquo;most balanced&rdquo; on this scale/property while 
[0246] <i>et al.</i> are &ldquo;most unbalanced;&rdquo; the other set-classes in this article&rsquo;s 
domain have varying degrees of unbalance on it.) The ANGLE-RECREL WT/anti-WT 
dimension thus appears to correspond to Lewin&rsquo;s FOURPROP(6) or its lack, and to 
suggest a potential way to quantify it. Possible correspondences between the 
other configuration dimensions and the other Fourier properties are less exact; 
more investigation is necessary. Readers, especially those frustrated by the 
lack of mathematical (vs. statistical) analysis in this article, are again urged 
to study this important dissertation. </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>Implications</b></p>
<p>[65] The above results about 
genera systems and the MDS configurations offer one possible answer to the broad 
philosophical question rhetorically posed at the beginning of this essay: just 
what sorts of &ldquo;musical intuitions&rdquo; are involved in our vague but loaded term, 
&ldquo;pitch-class set similarity?&rdquo; Most of the MDS results and some of the systems 
mentioned (e.g., Parks&rsquo; genera) involve familiar scales used by composers; these 
scales also correspond to group-theoretic models of pitch-chroma distribution. 
If we are primarily interested in set-classes that derive from such 
scales/models (as opposed to, say, the various Z-related pcsets or complementary 
hexachords), then the functions considered here yield ratings that mirror well 
the similarities and differences between such set-classes. </p>
<p>[66] Suppose we 
consider one of these proposed genera systems--let us stay with Parks for the 
sake of argument--to be a general system for pcset categorization. We then face 
an important issue. Several set-classes in the domain of cardinalities 
three-to-five simply do not belong to any of Parks&rsquo; four usable genera. The MDS 
results appear to support this in that many set-classes seem to have little of 
the properties being measured, based on their coordinates along the various 
dimensions--the huge near-zero clump in the diatonic/chromatic dimension is the 
most dramatic example. We may be forced to conclude that some set-classes are 
simply &ldquo;mongrels&rdquo; or &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; in terms of interesting musical (as opposed to 
set-theoretical) properties. Note that this is not just a subjective aesthetic 
judgment but a formal one about set-class structure as computed by multiple 
abstract functions.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> This is also distinct from, although not incompatible 
with, Quinn&rsquo;s (1997) idea of fuzzy pcset similarity: many pcsets still likely 
belong to one genus and a few might belong to several genera, but some may not 
belong to <i>any</i> genera (at least, any musically interesting or useful 
ones). </p>

<p>[67]     
<b>Table 7</b> lists 
those trichords through pentachords with coordinates in a &ldquo;near-zero&rdquo; category 
for at least two dimensions in the ANGLE or RECREL configurations. Some judgment 
calls were involved to decide cutoff values. For example, if a dimension had a 
number of coordinates between .001 and .15 then a gap to .39, all those small 
positive coordinates were considered to be near-zero. The Z-related tetrachords 
[0137]/[0146] and 5-11, [02347], are near-zero in all four dimensions for ANGLE 
and in three of the five RECREL dimensions; 5-Z12, [01356], also is near-zero in 
three RECREL dimensions. Several entries are clearly false alarms since they are 
of obvious musical interest along at least one other dimension: among other 
cases, the diminished, diatonic, and augmented triads are all on the list. For 
any set-classes that ultimately remain on the &ldquo;potential garbage&rdquo; list, 
however, it is worth examining the musical literature to see whether any of them 
have been exploited in any systematic way by atonal composers; and present-day 
atonal composers should ask themselves whether such set-classes offer worthwhile 
compositional possibilities.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> If 
they do turn out to be musically interesting, the question of what makes them so 
could very well suggest new approaches to the issue of pcset similarity. </p>
<p>[68] I 
have deliberately avoided &ldquo;value-neutral&rdquo; terms in favor of &ldquo;provocative&rdquo; 
language in the immediately preceding discussion because at this point we must 
reenter the (emotionally-laden) fray of aesthetic debate, and I feel it 
appropriate to &ldquo;get the blood flowing&rdquo; here. For example, for well over two 
thousand years, back to the Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems of Greek 
antiquity, [0235] as a melodic segment with its T-S-T ordered intervallic 
content has in some sense epitomized &ldquo;diatonicism.&rdquo; Yet, its coordinate is zero 
along the ANGLE-RECREL dimension that appears to measure that construct, 
indicating it has nothing of whatever property is being measured. Readers may be 
extremely dismayed by such a result. The entire motivation for this article was 
to show how numerical visualization techniques like MDS can provide quantitative 
clarification for concepts like &ldquo;diatonicism.&rdquo; As stated in paragraph 2, once we 
are armed with such information, we now can (and to my mind must) debate how, or 
whether, to use it. If multiple formal abstract functions indicate that 
&ldquo;diatonicism&rdquo; quantitatively equates to {ic5-content at least two; ic1-content 
zero; and zero content of at least one other ic}, do we want to accept that 
definition if it means the exclusion of [0235]? After all, the octatonic scale 
is saturated with [0235] to a much greater degree than the diatonic scale, so a 
good case can be made for [0235]&rsquo;s placement in that genus. If we want to reject 
this quantification, that is our prerogative; the present results force us to say 
with greater precision what we are rejecting and why. </p>
<p>[69] So, which similarity 
functions are &ldquo;really good?&rdquo; Such a question is vague to the point of 
meaninglessness. Better is, &ldquo;Which functions are most useful?&rdquo;, since it is at 
least possible to give operational criteria for &ldquo;utility.&rdquo; Castr&eacute;n (1994) 
discussed a number of such criteria in detail; while one might quibble with one 
or another of his desiderata, doing so is besides the point for the present 
essay. By implication, I consider functions that do not permit some form of 
quantitative comparison between set-classes of different cardinality to be much 
less useful than those that do--but people with other priorities might find 
binary functions like Forte&rsquo;s (1973) Rn relations useful. For still others 
needing to compare set-classes of different cardinalities, the present results 
suggest they mostly have a free hand to choose whichever function most closely 
matches their own aesthetics. The only caveat appears to be, avoid functions 
that are not robust, like ISIM2--once robustness has been determined for a 
function. If such users have deep disagreement with the similarity factors 
measured by these functions, however, it seems they will have to develop 
entirely different functions; and it is not at all clear how this might be done, 
or even if it is possible in principle. There is also the broader issue of the 
appropriate level of theoretical abstraction within which to examine similarity: 
most authors use Tn/I-equivalence, but Castr&eacute;n and some others take exception to 
this and use Tn-equivalence. This was not addressed here at all.<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup></p>
<p>[70] 
Finally, there is an entire gastank of worms waiting to be touched off: 
perception and cognition. The discussion in this article and the other works 
cited has been about abstract functions that consider formal structural 
properties of theoretical objects; it is a decidedly non-trivial question 
whether these results have anything whatsoever to do with how any human 
perceives actual musical objects. Some of the results here certainly seem to 
indicate at least a partial alignment between perception and theoretical 
features, in that set-classes considered highly diatonic, chromatic, or 
whole-tone by the functions studied here do match up with how we appear to group 
them based on our intuitive perceptions. This does not, however, account for all 
possible set-classes; and it says nothing at all about whether, and under what 
circumstances, other factors affect and/or take precedence for our perceptions 
of musical similarity.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> <i>Those</i> 
questions can only be addressed after numerous empirical studies. At the same 
time, we must decide whether or not we care if our theories of atonal musical 
structure take into account how we hear atonal music. Only after we have a 
consensus re the epistemological stance of the latter and (if we decide yes) the 
psychological data about the former will we be in a position to develop 
similarity functions of ultimate utility.</p>

implication-realization model for melodic expectation is a case in point. He 
proposes five interacting factors to account for listeners&rsquo; melodic

that the model can be simplified to just two factors without significant loss of 
explanatory power.<br><a href="#FN5REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN6">6.</a> In doing so, I fulfill the promise in my previous 
article in this journal (<a href="#samplaski_2004" id="citation_samplaski_2004_67dc9b427f85f">Samplaski 2004</a>, fn. 7) to provide &ldquo;a detailed but 
non-technical tutorial&rdquo; about MDS and some of the issues in its use. 
Nonetheless, this overview must perforce still be very superficial and exclude 
the theoretical underpinnings necessary to use the techniques appropriately; I 
can but hope that it will stimulate some readers to investigate possible 
applications to their own areas of music-theoretic research. The best initial 
pointer into the MDS literature remains Kruskal and Wish (<a href="#kruskal_and_wish_1978" id="citation_kruskal_and_wish_1978_67dc9b427f863">1978</a>), even though 
there have been a number of developments in the field since then.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> Quinn (<a href="#quinn_2004" id="citation_quinn_2004_67dc9b427f867">2004</a>) has recently completed a dissertation that analyzes in depth the 
mathematics behind pcset genera, and by extension, similarity functions. Since 
he considers not only twelve-fold division of the octave but other equal 
temperaments, his results clarify issues that remain obscured if one examines 
only the 12-ET universe. Interested readers should consult this important work.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> The ratings can be obtained in any of several ways: as 
direct estimates or impressions of similarity or distance; as same-different 
confusion rates (non-identical but similar stimuli are more likely to be 
mistaken for each other than dissimilar ones, so high confusion rates correlate 
with high similarity); etc.<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN9">9.</a> Without going deeply into topology, a torus can be 
embedded in variously-dimensioned spaces. In a three-dimensional space an 
observer on a torus&rsquo; surface would notice that the surface was non-Euclidean: 
the angle sum of a triangle would not be 180 degrees, etc. If a torus is 
embedded in a four-dimensional space, its surface will be &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in the sense of 
Euclidean geometry. This was the nature of the configuration found by Krumhansl 
and Kessler.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> Other distance metrics are possible. One, intuitively 
used daily by millions, is the &ldquo;city-block&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxi-cab&rdquo; metric, where to get 
from point A to point B you go J units in the first dimension, then K units in 
the next, etc. The general formula for such distance metrics is called the &ldquo;Minkowski 
distance metric.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> Even this assumption fails in the real world depending 
on the precision needed: the builders of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, between 
the NYC boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn, had to take the earth&rsquo;s 
curvature into account.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> Note that models such as ASCAL and INDSCAL are <i>not</i> 
invariant with respect to rescaling, or to rotation or reflection about axes. 
They also have a significantly larger number of free parameters to be estimated 
than simpler models. Moreover for INDSCAL, because individual biases are not 
canceled out by averaging responses into a single matrix, it can produce a much 
poorer fit to the data. A researcher should thus not automatically use one of 
these models in hopes of obtaining the most general result.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> In technical terms, as the number of free parameters 
being calculated increases relative to the number of data points, there become 
too few constraints on the possible configuration.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> If questions remain, the researcher should examine 
several different dimensionalities and be prepared to choose on the bases of 
clarity and logical interpretation. There are times where a solution one 
dimension above or below &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; as indicated by the stress/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> 
values might be better: 1) if there is a clear interpretation given an added 
dimension; or 2) if one configuration is easier to visualize (e.g., a 3-D vs. a 
4-D solution), especially in a situation where it is unclear what can be gained 
in explanatory power by using the extra dimension.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> In an MDS analysis of N objects, one of which is an 
exemplar, the only way to minimize distortion (i.e., stress) is to place the 
exemplar at the center of the configuration and arrange the other objects around 
it, along the rim of a circle/sphere/equivalent higher surface. One can always 
draw a circle through three non-colinear points, a sphere through four 
non-coplanar points, etc.; so, adding in the exemplar, an N-dimensional MDS 
solution can in general accommodate N+2 objects (where one is an exemplar) 
without problems. Of course, for some datasets one will be able to fit more 
objects than this along the surface&rsquo;s rim; and in other cases the limit can be 
somewhat liberalized by locating the exemplar off-center in the 
circle/sphere/etc., or by using an ellipse/oblate spheroid/etc. as the surface. 
This will, though, only go so far: if you try to fit a set of 23 objects 
including an exemplar in two or three dimensions, you must expect a fair amount 
of stress in the solution.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> An example dating back to the great nineteenth century 
psychologist William James is: the moon is like a ball because they are both 
round; the moon is also like a gas lantern because they both illuminate; but we 
do not think of a ball as being like a gas lantern.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> This study considers only results from MDS, so no 
further discussion of CA is necessary; it is mentioned to raise awareness of the 
issues that render it appropriate for various situations. Some of Quinn&rsquo;s (<a href="#quinn_1997" id="citation_quinn_1997_67dc9b427f86a">1997</a>, 
<a href="#quinn_2001" id="citation_quinn_2001_67dc9b427f86e">2001</a>) analyses of pcset similarity measures use CA; as discussed in paragraphs 
61&ndash;63, he obtains results compatible with those reported here.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> This model underlies MacKay and Zinnes&rsquo; 
(<a href="#mackay_and_zinnes_1999" id="citation_mackay_and_zinnes_1999_67dc9b427f872">1999</a>) PROSCAL program. A different model underlies an older PMDS program called 
MULTISCALE (<a href="#ramsay_1977" id="citation_ramsay_1977_67dc9b427f875">Ramsay 1977</a>), but we need not worry about the distinctions.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> The present article is a case in point: analyses of 
the datasets herein took a few seconds on a PC of moderate speed, using the 
statistical package SPSS; the 
equivalent analyses on the same machine using PROSCAL took up to forty minutes.<br><a href="#FN19REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN20">20.</a> AMEMB2 is a modification of Rahn&rsquo;s (<a href="#rahn_1979&ndash;80" id="citation_rahn_1979&ndash;80_67dc9b427f879">1979&ndash;80</a>) MEMB2 
function by Isaacson for inclusion in the latter&rsquo;s Winsims calculator, available 
at <a href='http://theory.music.indiana.edu/isaacso/winsims.html'>http://theory.music.indiana.edu/isaacso/winsims.html</a>; 
Isaacson applies a normalization factor equivalent to that used by Rahn to 
derive ATMEMB from his TMEMB function. For narrative simplicity, it seemed 
preferable to refer to it as Rahn&rsquo;s function. Note that while AMEMB2 is 
concerned with cardinality-two sets, i.e., interval-classes, it is not an icv-based 
function in the sense of ANGLE <i>et al.</i>, since it only counts how many 
instances of each dyad are mutually imbedded in two pcsets--for example, in 
returning a comparison for [0156] and [0167], only one ic6 in the latter is 
counted. I thus treat it as a subset-based measure.<br><a href="#FN20REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN21">21.</a> That is, the icv of any nonachord is a 
function of the icv of its trichord complement, and similarly for octachords/tetrachords 
and heptachords/pentachords; ratings produced by icv-based similarity functions 
are therefore also related. The precise functions involved differ for each pair 
of cardinalities, but they are systematic for those pairs.<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> That value is actually a severe understatement; it is 
the limit of accuracy reported by the statistical package used. Obtaining an <i>r</i> 
of better than .96 (between ANGLE and RECREL) over 3160 observations is so close 
to perfection as to be basically unheard-of for a &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; dataset.<br><a href="#FN22REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN23">23.</a> Various additional types of cross-check analyses were 
carried out using PROSCAL to the extent possible given the version of the 
program available&mdash;the 4x5 and 3x5 datasets were too large. These are omitted 
for considerations of space, minimization of technical detail, and reader 
patience.<br><a href="#FN23REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN24">24.</a> In particular, the 3x3 dataset, with only 12 objects, 
is far too sketchy to understand what is going on for most of its configuration. 
The same holds true to lesser extents for the other smaller datasets.<br><a href="#FN24REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN25">25.</a> If one is determined to try to visualize a 
four-dimensional object, the best starting place is Edwin Abbott&rsquo;s classic story <i>Flatland</i> 
(<a href="#abbott_1885-1952" id="citation_abbott_1885-1952_67dc9b427f87d">1885/1952</a>). With modern computer graphics, it is now possible to get a 
direct visceral appreciation of such objects via programs that manipulate their 
projections onto the screen.<br><a href="#FN25REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN26">26.</a> Since the Procrustes rotation deals with the derived 
configurations, which involve the final relative set-class locations in abstract 
space, we need not worry that the latter two functions rate similarity while 
RECREL rates dissimilarity.<br><a href="#FN26REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN27">27.</a> A <i>p</i>-value of .05 is the typical cutoff value 
for empirical studies, in that researchers are usually willing to risk a 1 in 20 
chance of reporting a false positive result. (Certain types of studies, e.g., 
clinical drug trials, obviously must set far more stringent standards.)<br><a href="#FN27REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN28">28.</a> There is no possibility of problems due to axial 
reflection, since the Procrustes rotation would have handled that.<br><a href="#FN28REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN29">29.</a> The most surprising of these cases is the 
disappearance of the ic1/ic5 dimension for cardinality-three set-classes in the 
3x4 dataset. Given the coordinates of the rotated subconfiguration, that 
dimension appears to involve an &ldquo;ic3/anti-ic6 vs. ic6/anti-ic3&rdquo; opposition, as 
seen on the second section of <a target='ex_window' onClick='newwindow('samplaski_table5.html',1000,800); return false;' href='samplaski_table5.html'>
Table 5</a>.<br><a href="#FN29REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN30">30.</a> Forte only lists hexachords up to 6-35 in his table on 
pages 264&ndash;266 that summarizes the makeup of the genera. From the inclusion rules 
on page 192 one can deduce that the remaining 15 hexachords belong to the same 
genera as their Z-related counterparts, but it would have been better just to 
list them explicitly, since he lists all Z-related tetrachords and pentachords<br><a href="#FN30REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN31">31.</a> Harris (<a href="#harris_1989" id="citation_harris_1989_67dc9b427f881">1989</a>) follows this same procedure, except that 
he draws from a wide body of musical literature, and he is explicitly <i>not</i> 
working from a pcset-influenced background. His system of chord families is much 
more complicated than Parks&rsquo;, but it has a great deal of solid and thoughtful 
musicianship behind it. His proposal deserves closer attention by the 
music-theoretic community.<br><a href="#FN31REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN32">32.</a> If we adjust cutoff values, we can re-include 5-2 and 
5-3, although 5-4 and 5-8 ([01236] and [02346]) will also come along.<br><a href="#FN32REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN33">33.</a> The term refers to a probabilistic process that is 
repeatedly carried out (as in, &ldquo;repeated throws of the dice at Monte Carlo&rdquo;) to 
determine a result. The technique is often used to simulate physical processes; 
it has some relation to the stochastic algorithms used to generate a number of 
Xenakis&rsquo; compositions.<br><a href="#FN33REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN34">34.</a> The speculation two paragraphs ago about Quinn&rsquo;s 
hexachord group B, whose members all had fairly high connections to other 
clusters (unlike members of the remaining six groups), applies: might an MDS 
analysis of hexachords show all his group B hexachords to be &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; 
set-classes?<br><a href="#FN34REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN35">35.</a> As an example, if I alternately play 0137/0146 in 
closest spacing with the same bass note I feel a definite sense of 
tonic/dominant, presumably due to the imbedded minor triad in 0137 and the 
semitone neighbor in the soprano in 0146 acting like a leading tone. I could 
easily envision exploiting this type of perceived relationship in a composition.<br><a href="#FN35REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN36">36.</a> Using Tn-equivalence raises a number of 
questions; in particular, would the dimensionality of the configurations change? 
Since a major priority for this essay was to compare RECREL with several other 
functions, all of which use Tn/I-equivalence, it was necessary to eliminate the 
B-forms of asymmetrical set-classes from consideration, obviating all such 
issues. Morris (<a href="#morris_1995" id="citation_morris_1995_67dc9b427f885">1995</a>) lists several other possible levels of abstraction. Most 
of these have as yet received little or no attention by music theorists, a 
situation which sorely needs correction.<br><a href="#FN36REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN37">37.</a> To cite one example, Samplaski (<a href="#samplaski_2004" id="citation_samplaski_2004_67dc9b427f889">2004</a>) found support 
for grouping interval-classes by category of acoustical dissonance, rather than 
treating them as separate isolated entities. If other studies confirm this 
result, that would strongly imply a need for substantial modification of 
existing similarity measures.<br><a href="#FN37REF">Return to text</a></p><div id="fndiv1" class="flyoverdiv">Surveys and critiques of most similarity measures can be

article in this journal (<a href="#samplaski_2004" id="citation_samplaski_2004_67dc9b427f85f">Samplaski 2004</a>, fn. 7) to provide &ldquo;a detailed but 
non-technical tutorial&rdquo; about MDS and some of the issues in its use. 
Nonetheless, this overview must perforce still be very superficial and exclude 
the theoretical underpinnings necessary to use the techniques appropriately; I 
can but hope that it will stimulate some readers to investigate possible 
applications to their own areas of music-theoretic research. The best initial 
pointer into the MDS literature remains Kruskal and Wish (<a href="#kruskal_and_wish_1978" id="citation_kruskal_and_wish_1978_67dc9b427f863">1978</a>), even though 
there have been a number of developments in the field since then.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Quinn (<a href="#quinn_2004" id="citation_quinn_2004_67dc9b427f867">2004</a>) has recently completed a dissertation that analyzes in depth the 
mathematics behind pcset genera, and by extension, similarity functions. Since 
he considers not only twelve-fold division of the octave but other equal 
temperaments, his results clarify issues that remain obscured if one examines 
only the 12-ET universe. Interested readers should consult this important work.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">The ratings can be obtained in any of several ways: as 
direct estimates or impressions of similarity or distance; as same-different 
confusion rates (non-identical but similar stimuli are more likely to be 
mistaken for each other than dissimilar ones, so high confusion rates correlate 
with high similarity); etc.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Without going deeply into topology, a torus can be 
embedded in variously-dimensioned spaces. In a three-dimensional space an 
observer on a torus&rsquo; surface would notice that the surface was non-Euclidean: 
the angle sum of a triangle would not be 180 degrees, etc. If a torus is 
embedded in a four-dimensional space, its surface will be &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in the sense of 
Euclidean geometry. This was the nature of the configuration found by Krumhansl 
and Kessler.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Other distance metrics are possible. One, intuitively 
used daily by millions, is the &ldquo;city-block&rdquo; or &ldquo;taxi-cab&rdquo; metric, where to get 
from point A to point B you go J units in the first dimension, then K units in 
the next, etc. The general formula for such distance metrics is called the &ldquo;Minkowski 
distance metric.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Even this assumption fails in the real world depending 
on the precision needed: the builders of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, between 
the NYC boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn, had to take the earth&rsquo;s 
curvature into account.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Note that models such as ASCAL and INDSCAL are <i>not</i> 
invariant with respect to rescaling, or to rotation or reflection about axes. 
They also have a significantly larger number of free parameters to be estimated 
than simpler models. Moreover for INDSCAL, because individual biases are not 
canceled out by averaging responses into a single matrix, it can produce a much 
poorer fit to the data. A researcher should thus not automatically use one of 
these models in hopes of obtaining the most general result.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">In technical terms, as the number of free parameters 
being calculated increases relative to the number of data points, there become 
too few constraints on the possible configuration.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">If questions remain, the researcher should examine 
several different dimensionalities and be prepared to choose on the bases of 
clarity and logical interpretation. There are times where a solution one 
dimension above or below &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; as indicated by the stress/<i>r</i>2 
values might be better: 1) if there is a clear interpretation given an added 
dimension; or 2) if one configuration is easier to visualize (e.g., a 3-D vs. a 
4-D solution), especially in a situation where it is unclear what can be gained 
in explanatory power by using the extra dimension.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">In an MDS analysis of N objects, one of which is an 
exemplar, the only way to minimize distortion (i.e., stress) is to place the 
exemplar at the center of the configuration and arrange the other objects around 
it, along the rim of a circle/sphere/equivalent higher surface. One can always 
draw a circle through three non-colinear points, a sphere through four 
non-coplanar points, etc.; so, adding in the exemplar, an N-dimensional MDS 
solution can in general accommodate N+2 objects (where one is an exemplar) 
without problems. Of course, for some datasets one will be able to fit more 
objects than this along the surface&rsquo;s rim; and in other cases the limit can be 
somewhat liberalized by locating the exemplar off-center in the 
circle/sphere/etc., or by using an ellipse/oblate spheroid/etc. as the surface. 
This will, though, only go so far: if you try to fit a set of 23 objects 
including an exemplar in two or three dimensions, you must expect a fair amount 
of stress in the solution.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">An example dating back to the great nineteenth century 
psychologist William James is: the moon is like a ball because they are both 
round; the moon is also like a gas lantern because they both illuminate; but we 
do not think of a ball as being like a gas lantern.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">This study considers only results from MDS, so no 
further discussion of CA is necessary; it is mentioned to raise awareness of the 
issues that render it appropriate for various situations. Some of Quinn&rsquo;s (<a href="#quinn_1997" id="citation_quinn_1997_67dc9b427f86a">1997</a>, 
<a href="#quinn_2001" id="citation_quinn_2001_67dc9b427f86e">2001</a>) analyses of pcset similarity measures use CA; as discussed in paragraphs 
61&ndash;63, he obtains results compatible with those reported here.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">This model underlies MacKay and Zinnes&rsquo; 
(<a href="#mackay_and_zinnes_1999" id="citation_mackay_and_zinnes_1999_67dc9b427f872">1999</a>) PROSCAL program. A different model underlies an older PMDS program called 
MULTISCALE (<a href="#ramsay_1977" id="citation_ramsay_1977_67dc9b427f875">Ramsay 1977</a>), but we need not worry about the distinctions.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">The present article is a case in point: analyses of 
the datasets herein took a few seconds on a PC of moderate speed, using the 
statistical package SPSS; the 
equivalent analyses on the same machine using PROSCAL took up to forty minutes.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">AMEMB2 is a modification of Rahn&rsquo;s (<a href="#rahn_1979&ndash;80" id="citation_rahn_1979&ndash;80_67dc9b427f879">1979&ndash;80</a>) MEMB2 
function by Isaacson for inclusion in the latter&rsquo;s Winsims calculator, available 
at <a href='http://theory.music.indiana.edu/isaacso/winsims.html'>http://theory.music.indiana.edu/isaacso/winsims.html</a>; 
Isaacson applies a normalization factor equivalent to that used by Rahn to 
derive ATMEMB from his TMEMB function. For narrative simplicity, it seemed 
preferable to refer to it as Rahn&rsquo;s function. Note that while AMEMB2 is 
concerned with cardinality-two sets, i.e., interval-classes, it is not an icv-based 
function in the sense of ANGLE <i>et al.</i>, since it only counts how many 
instances of each dyad are mutually imbedded in two pcsets--for example, in 
returning a comparison for [0156] and [0167], only one ic6 in the latter is 
counted. I thus treat it as a subset-based measure.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">That is, the icv of any nonachord is a 
function of the icv of its trichord complement, and similarly for octachords/tetrachords 
and heptachords/pentachords; ratings produced by icv-based similarity functions 
are therefore also related. The precise functions involved differ for each pair 
of cardinalities, but they are systematic for those pairs.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">That value is actually a severe understatement; it is 
the limit of accuracy reported by the statistical package used. Obtaining an <i>r</i> 
of better than .96 (between ANGLE and RECREL) over 3160 observations is so close 
to perfection as to be basically unheard-of for a &ldquo;real-life&rdquo; dataset.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">Various additional types of cross-check analyses were 
carried out using PROSCAL to the extent possible given the version of the 
program available&mdash;the 4x5 and 3x5 datasets were too large. These are omitted 
for considerations of space, minimization of technical detail, and reader 
patience.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">In particular, the 3x3 dataset, with only 12 objects, 
is far too sketchy to understand what is going on for most of its configuration. 
The same holds true to lesser extents for the other smaller datasets.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">If one is determined to try to visualize a 
four-dimensional object, the best starting place is Edwin Abbott&rsquo;s classic story <i>Flatland</i> 
(<a href="#abbott_1885-1952" id="citation_abbott_1885-1952_67dc9b427f87d">1885/1952</a>). With modern computer graphics, it is now possible to get a 
direct visceral appreciation of such objects via programs that manipulate their 
projections onto the screen.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">Since the Procrustes rotation deals with the derived 
configurations, which involve the final relative set-class locations in abstract 
space, we need not worry that the latter two functions rate similarity while 
RECREL rates dissimilarity.</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">A <i>p</i>-value of .05 is the typical cutoff value 
for empirical studies, in that researchers are usually willing to risk a 1 in 20 
chance of reporting a false positive result. (Certain types of studies, e.g., 
clinical drug trials, obviously must set far more stringent standards.)</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">There is no possibility of problems due to axial 
reflection, since the Procrustes rotation would have handled that.</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">The most surprising of these cases is the 
disappearance of the ic1/ic5 dimension for cardinality-three set-classes in the 
3x4 dataset. Given the coordinates of the rotated subconfiguration, that 
dimension appears to involve an &ldquo;ic3/anti-ic6 vs. ic6/anti-ic3&rdquo; opposition, as 
seen on the second section of <a target='ex_window' onClick='newwindow('samplaski_table5.html',1000,800); return false;' href='samplaski_table5.html'>
Table 5</a>.</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">Forte only lists hexachords up to 6-35 in his table on 
pages 264&ndash;266 that summarizes the makeup of the genera. From the inclusion rules 
on page 192 one can deduce that the remaining 15 hexachords belong to the same 
genera as their Z-related counterparts, but it would have been better just to 
list them explicitly, since he lists all Z-related tetrachords and pentachords</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">Harris (<a href="#harris_1989" id="citation_harris_1989_67dc9b427f881">1989</a>) follows this same procedure, except that 
he draws from a wide body of musical literature, and he is explicitly <i>not</i> 
working from a pcset-influenced background. His system of chord families is much 
more complicated than Parks&rsquo;, but it has a great deal of solid and thoughtful 
musicianship behind it. His proposal deserves closer attention by the 
music-theoretic community.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">If we adjust cutoff values, we can re-include 5-2 and 
5-3, although 5-4 and 5-8 ([01236] and [02346]) will also come along.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">The term refers to a probabilistic process that is 
repeatedly carried out (as in, &ldquo;repeated throws of the dice at Monte Carlo&rdquo;) to 
determine a result. The technique is often used to simulate physical processes; 
it has some relation to the stochastic algorithms used to generate a number of 
Xenakis&rsquo; compositions.</div><div id="fndiv34" class="flyoverdiv">The speculation two paragraphs ago about Quinn&rsquo;s 
hexachord group B, whose members all had fairly high connections to other 
clusters (unlike members of the remaining six groups), applies: might an MDS 
analysis of hexachords show all his group B hexachords to be &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; 
set-classes?</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">As an example, if I alternately play 0137/0146 in 
closest spacing with the same bass note I feel a definite sense of 
tonic/dominant, presumably due to the imbedded minor triad in 0137 and the 
semitone neighbor in the soprano in 0146 acting like a leading tone. I could 
easily envision exploiting this type of perceived relationship in a composition.</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv">Using Tn-equivalence raises a number of 
questions; in particular, would the dimensionality of the configurations change? 
Since a major priority for this essay was to compare RECREL with several other 
functions, all of which use Tn/I-equivalence, it was necessary to eliminate the 
B-forms of asymmetrical set-classes from consideration, obviating all such 
issues. Morris (<a href="#morris_1995" id="citation_morris_1995_67dc9b427f885">1995</a>) lists several other possible levels of abstraction. Most 
of these have as yet received little or no attention by music theorists, a 
situation which sorely needs correction.</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">To cite one example, Samplaski (<a href="#samplaski_2004" id="citation_samplaski_2004_67dc9b427f889">2004</a>) found support 
for grouping interval-classes by category of acoustical dissonance, rather than 
treating them as separate isolated entities. If other studies confirm this 
result, that would strongly imply a need for substantial modification of 
existing similarity measures.</div>
