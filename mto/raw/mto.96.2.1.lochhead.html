<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] <i>Embodied Voices: Representing female vocality in western
culture</i> is a collection of fourteen essays by authors from
various humanistic disciplines. Of the fourteen, two are by
authors listed as teaching in music departments; the remaining
authors are professionally engaged as scholars of English and
French literature, comparative studies, and cinema. The essays
address 1) vocal music&mdash;especially music sung by women&mdash;as it is
depicted in literature and film, 2) the representation of female
voice in filmic conventions, 3) the role of women as singers in
various musical traditions, and 4) attitudes toward the female
voice revealed by electronic reproduction. The conceptual
category underlying the essays is &ldquo;embodiment.&rdquo;
<p>

[2] In their introduction, the two editors, Leslie C. Dunn and
Nancy A. Jones, define the philosophical context in which
the concept of embodiment comes into play. They invoke the
theories of French poststructuralists such as Julia Kristeva,
Michel Poizat, and Roland Barthes<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
which maintain that the
meaning of a vocal utterance&mdash;spoken or sung&mdash;is constituted not
simply by its semantic content but also by its sonorous content.  
Drawing on Barthes&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;the grain of the voice&rdquo; in
particular, Dunn and Jones focus attention on the essential role
played by the &ldquo;purely sonorous&rdquo; features of the &ldquo;audible female
voice&rdquo; in &ldquo;the construction of its non-verbal meanings&rdquo; (p. 2).
We may note here that these purely sonorous features are those
often identified as &ldquo;musical&rdquo;&mdash;register, sound quality, dynamics,
accent, rhythm, and tempo.<p>

[3] The concept of &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo; comes into play through the
editors&rsquo; explicit acknowledgement that sonorous features
must be conceptually linked to the production of vocal sound
through a person&rsquo;s body. The collection focuses specifically on
the production of sound by female bodies or by a male body meant
to project in some sense a female voice. Their insistence on the
linking of vocal sound to its human producer draws attention to
the idea of sound as &ldquo;performed.&rdquo; But the concept of embodiment
goes beyond a simple notion of performance as a &ldquo;putting out&rdquo; of
sound. It recognizes not only the source of vocal production but
also the various factors of acculturation that affect the
reception of vocal sound&mdash;of &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; vocal production in this
instance. The editors assert that vocal meaning&mdash;be it musical
or spoken&mdash;derives from &ldquo;an intersubjective acoustic space&rdquo; and
that any attempt to articulate that meaning must necessarily
&ldquo;reconstruct<nobr> . . . </nobr>the contexts of<nobr> . . . </nobr>hearing&rdquo; (p. 2). 
<p>

[4] In asserting that performative aspects of sound contribute to
vocal meaning, Dunn and Jones recognize the roles played by 1)
the person or people producing the sound, 2) the person or people
hearing the produced sound and 3) the acoustical and social
contexts in which production and hearing occur. The &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of
any vocal sound, then, must be understood as co-constituted by
performative as well as semantic/structural features. This is
the underlying concept that makes the collection of importance to
scholars of music. I&rsquo;ll return to this point shortly. 
<p>

[5] The interest in embodied knowledge has been reflected in a
wide variety of humanistic and scientific fields in the last
twenty years. Studies focusing on how the human body figures in
the ways we know our world range across several disciplines: 
<i>The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience,</i> by
Varela, Thompson, and Rosch; <i>Throwing Like a Girl and Other
Essays in Feminist Philosophy and Social Theory,</i> by Young;
<i>Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science,</i> edited by
Jacobus, Fox Keller, and Shuttleworth; and <i>The Address of the
Eye: A Phenomenology of Film Experience,</i> by Sobchack.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> These
texts are indebted implicitly or explicitly to the
phenomenological philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, whose
various writings articulate a theory of cognition which
recognizes the intersubjective and bodily basis of all human
knowledge.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p>

[6] The various authors of <i>Embodied Voices</i> tap into the  
philosophical tradition of embodiment by showing how the culturally 
gendered bodies both of vocal performers and of hearers are reflected 
in the meanings of those vocal sounds. Some examples should help to 
clarify these issues. 
<p>

[7] Two essays demonstrate some aspects of the concept of
embodiment in vocal performance: &ldquo;The voice of lament: female
vocality and performative efficacy in the Finnish-Karelian
<i>itkuvirsi</i>&rdquo; by Elizabeth Tolbert (pp. 179&ndash;196) and &ldquo;Red hot
mamas: Bessie Smith, Sophie Tucker, and the ethnic maternal voice
in American popular song&rdquo; by Peter Antelyes (pp. 212&ndash;229). 
Tolbert demonstrates that women from Karelia (who
are refugees living now in Finland) sing laments (<i>itkuvirsi</i>)
that are characterized as feminine through a variety
of &ldquo;<i>texted</i> and <i>melodic</i>&rdquo; figures. These figures constitute
&ldquo;icons of crying&rdquo; that intersubjectively signal the emotions
necessary for the lament. Tolbert writes: 
<p>
<blockquote>
   The lamenter projects the experience of grief through her
   individual voice as a means to orchestrate the collective
   experience of sorrow. It is the very quality of the female
   crying voice, a voice that &lsquo;cries with words,&rsquo; that is
   elaborated in performance to symbolize affect and to set 
   this genre apart from others to accomplish cultural work
   grounded in the experience of grief (p. 180).
</blockquote>

<p>Note how Tolbert links the expressive efficacy of the Karelian
lament&mdash;its intersubjective meaning&mdash;directly to the vocal
quality of the female voice. Later she also links the sound of
the female voice to the sound of the text and to certain
improvised melodic features of the lamenting. Through this
linking Tolbert demonstrates that the Karelian lament embodies
grief through the sound of the female voice and through its
texted and musical features that act as &ldquo;icons of crying.&rdquo; In
other words, the meaning of the lament can not be conceptually
separated from the female body that produces it. 
<p>

[8] In his essay, Peter Antelyes demonstrates how the &ldquo;red hot
mama&rdquo; developed as a vocal type through such singers as Bessie
Smith and Sophie Tucker and how the musical features
of this vocal type are linked to the female body and to
the specifically female features epitomized by performers like
Smith and Tucker (e.g., the &ldquo;hour-glass&rdquo; figure). Antelyes
demonstrates how Smith and Tucker were both characterized by the
largeness of their physical bodies and of their voices. As
Antelyes points out, the bodily presence afforded by both aspects
of the red hot mama&rsquo;s size allowed her &ldquo;to escape reduction to,
and containment within, her body&rdquo; (p. 217). Further, the lyrics
of her songs in conjunction with her sizeable vocal presence,
allowed the red hot mama to &ldquo;reclaim<nobr> . . . </nobr>the female body from the
patriarchal reductionism that objectified women as bodies alone&rdquo;
(p. 217).<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> For Antelyes, the 
meaning of the red hot mamas&rsquo;s
songs derived from her large physical and vocal presence and from
the way the lyrics play off of patriarchal expectations of the
female body. 
<p>

[9] While the essays as a group express no single manifestation of
the concept of embodiment, each maintains the underlying concern
with the performative aspects of sounding meaning. Indeed, the
wide variety of approaches to the voice and to vocality allows
readers to explore the depth of nuance that the concept of
embodiment entails. The editors have organized this wide variety
of approaches in two ways. First, there is a mostly chronological 
ordering of the topics: the first essay addresses the &ldquo;Gorgon and 
the nightingale&rdquo; in Pindar&rsquo;s Twelfth <i>Pythian Ode</i> while the last 
deals with Madonna&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Like a Prayer&rdquo; and her &ldquo;Make a Wish&rdquo; 
commercial. The second ordering, the one reflected in the book&rsquo;s 
larger sections, reflects four large topics: Part I&mdash;&ldquo;myths and 
fantasies of the female voice&rdquo; (p. 7); Part II&mdash;&ldquo;listeners&rsquo;  
responses to female vocality&rdquo; (p. 8); Part III&mdash;the &ldquo;cultural 
authority and creative force&rdquo; of &ldquo;feminine vocality&rdquo; (p. 10); 
and Part IV&mdash;&ldquo;the potent dream of maternal presence&rdquo; through female 
vocality. 
<p>

[10] The essays of Part I address female vocality in literature
by Pindar, Dante, Shakespeare, and Wordsworth. In Part II, they
focus on performance traditions in late-sixteenth and early-
seventeenth-century English theater; mid-twentieth-century
attitudes toward the trained female voice in the American film
musical; and perceptual reactions to the disembodiment of the
female voice through electronic reproduction. The essays of
Part III address George Eliot&rsquo;s <i>Armgart</i>, which meditates on the
authority displayed by the opera diva in her vocal performances;
the resituating of a female voice in Louise Colet&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;protofeminist text&rdquo; <i>La Servante</i> (p. 11); the vocal
implications of the cinematic technique of direct address in
films by Francois Truffaut and Trinh Minh Ha; and the cultural
power of the female voice in ritual lament. Finally, the essays
of Part IV address the role of mothers&rsquo;s songs in novels of Toni
Morrison; the expressive power of the red hot mamas in the early-
twentieth-century blues tradition; and Madonna&rsquo;s role in the
tradition of women&rsquo;s creativity in the twentieth century.
<p>

[11] I conclude by adopting a more evaluative stance toward the
collection, returning finally to the concept of performative
embodiment which makes these essays significant for music
scholars. In their introduction, Dunn and Jones state that
&ldquo;voices inhabit an intersubjective acoustic space&rdquo; and that to
understand the meaning of vocally-produced sound, the &ldquo;contexts
of hearing&rdquo;&mdash;the intersubjective acoustic space&mdash;must be
recovered. All of the essays succeed in their attempts to
recover&mdash;or better to dis-cover&mdash;the layers of acculturation that
play a role in &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; but few make any attempt to dis-cover
the qualitative features of vocal sound that are performed or
received in that context. There is little discussion of vocal or
musical sound as such and what does occur is spare and merely
suggestive.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p>

[12] In all fairness I should point out that many of the essays
are about sounds that have never &rdquo;actually&quot; occurred, as in the
fictional accounts of Sirens and opera divas, but this focus
affirms the literary interests of the authors&mdash;interests that may
not automatically transfer to the interests of musical scholars. 
One essay, that by Elizabeth Tolbert on Karelian laments, stands
apart from the others in its theorizing of the relation between
sounding features and meaning in music. Tolbert&rsquo;s essay alone
makes claims about how specific sounds project specific meanings;
and while not answering all questions arising from such
endeavors, it provides a strong example.
<p>

[13] But it is not simply on the basis of Tolbert&rsquo;s article that
I recommend this book for scholars of music. The essays of
<i>Embodied Voices</i> include little discussion of music as a
sounding phenomenon, but they do suggest ways in which we may
profitably theorize about musical sound. Dunn and Jones&rsquo;s
insistence on the embodied, on the performative aspects of vocal
sound provides a good model for a similar approach to musical
sound&mdash;an approach that recognizes sound as produced by someone,
as heard by someone, and as a product of a social and acoustical
context. An approach to musical analysis that takes account of
production, reception and context can be figured in diverse ways.
We can no longer reject the performative aspects of sound because
of their changeability, because of their contingency on time,
person, and place.  Quite the contrary, it is precisely because
of the changeable features of performance that music wields its
immense expressive power. The essays of <i>Embodied Voices</i> are
important because they teach us&mdash;<i>us</i> as music theorists&mdash;about
the varieties of performative embodiment that are correlated with
music&rsquo;s expressive powers.</p>
