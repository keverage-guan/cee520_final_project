<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] With ten reviews across three languages, Kevin Korsyn&#8217;s <i>Decentering 
Music: A Critique of Contemporary Musical Research</i> has been the focus of 
significant discussion in recent theoretical literature and also received broad 
attention from music historians.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> This book has been examined in Dutch and German 
journals, has been the focus of a critical symposium in <i>Theory and Practice</i>, and, most 
recently, has fueled an exchange in the <i>Journal 
of the American Musicological Society </i>between Martin Scherzinger and Korsyn 
himself.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Certainly, much has been 
written for and against this book, which is not to suggest that further reviews would 
not yield lively, productive debate, but I do not claim to have unearthed new 
revelations about his ideas. One might also question if I am the best person to 
review <i>Decentering Music</i>. Korsyn&#8217;s work has been influential upon my own 
research, and I may appear too closely tied to these ways of thinking to offer a 
sufficiently impartial perspective.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> These obstacles, however, are not crippling 
to my endeavor because I have no intention of offering a traditional review. 
Rather, in light of much of the substantive work that has already been written 
(and with which I will assume the reader&#8217;s familiarity), I feel it is more productive at this point in the history of the 
book to comment on its reception.</p>
<p>[2] As I read each review (the one in Dutch being the only exception because I 
was not able find a useable translation), I was surprised to find such diverse 
readings of this text. A mixed reaction is not unusual by any means, but many of 
the reviewers of Korsyn&#8217;s book seemed a bit more polarized than normal. There 
was little or no consensus regarding some very general issues, like the overall 
contribution of the book to the field based on the historical relevance of its 
arguments or an accepted understanding of the current state of musical 
scholarship. I began asking how one book could be interpreted so differently. 
The provocative and seemingly controversial ideas presented in <i>Decentering Music</i> 
have been warmly embraced by some scholars while unequivocally dismissed by 
others. It then occurred to me that, better than regurgitating many of the 
points already made, it would be more interesting to explore how and why 
critical reactions to this book have proved so divergent. In this sense, I offer 
a review of the reviews, or perhaps a meta-review&#8212;a task that aligns with the 
spirit of <i>Decentering Music</i>.</p>

<p>[3] The issue that is immediately apparent in a survey of Korsyn reviews is the 
opposing language used to describe the book overall. In perhaps the most 
negative response, Peter Williams concludes, &#8220;It seems to me that the &#8216;crisis&#8217; 
in higher music study as understood and outlined by Korsyn&#8212;the &#8216;struggle among 
factions that compete for the cultural authority to speak about music&#8217; and 
&#8216;scholarly production [that] is forcing discourse towards increasing 
uniformity&#8217;&#8212;is only fostered by such a book as this. I am not sure what would be 
lost by simply ignoring it.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> While Williams encourages us to ignore 
<i>Decentering Music</i> altogether, Lawrence Kramer endorses it on the jacket cover to the 
paperback edition, &#8220;Anyone interested in the state of the musicological art 
should find the arguments impossible to ignore.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Likewise, Elizabeth Hellmuth 
Margulis finds the book, <nobr>&#8220;. . . intriguing,</nobr> maddening, and eminently worth 
reading.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>[4] Another issue regarding the general reception of this study is the 
interpretation of the historical relevance of Korsyn&#8217;s arguments. Wolfgang 
Fuhrmann, for example, believes the book, &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> comes at the right time. It is the 
first large-scale study to go beyond pro and con positions and grasp the 
situation as a whole,&#8221; and Phyllis Weaver describes it as, &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> groundbreaking, 
making this one of the most important studies to reach the academic bookshop in 
recent years <nobr>. . .</nobr> Korsyn&#8217;s timely book poses provocative questions and is a useful 
starting point for engaging with questions about interdisciplinary scholarship 
and how it interacts with the professional world that surrounds and, on many 
levels, influences it.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> But this reaction is sharply contrasted by Ruth Solie, 
who dismisses the book almost entirely based on her belief that <i>Decentering 
Music</i>, &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> is an elegy for troubles that have by now largely resolved themselves.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>			To a far less severe degree than Solie, Patrick McCreless criticizes the book 
along the lines that many of the issues Korsyn raises have been addressed in 
previous scholarship.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>[5] Moving deeper, McCreless and Phyllis Weliver try to take Korsyn on at his 
own game, using the tools of critical theory to turn criticism back on the book. 
Both attempt to understand <i>Decentering Music</i> in terms of its discursive mode, 
but again, there seems to be a level of discord in how the two authors read the 
text. McCreless, for instance, considers <i>Decentering Music</i> as embodying one of 
Northrop Frye&#8217;s four archetypes of plot narrative (romance, comedy, tragedy, and 
satire)&#8212;a strategy adopted by Korsyn in his critique of musical scholarship (see 
Chapter 3). Although McCreless briefly considers the book as a romance, he 
spends a considerable amount of time explaining Korsyn&#8217;s narrative strategy as, 
more or less, a scholarly comedy, featuring Korsyn as the protagonist, in which a crisis unfolds and finally reaches some level of resolution.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>			Meanwhile, Weliver uses another of Korsyn&#8217;s analytical tools, Hayden White&#8217;s 
theory of tropes (metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony), to interpret the 
mode of discourse. She argues that Korsyn misunderstands his own position when 
he suggests a &#8220;certain irony&#8221; in the book. Rather, she feels that, &#8220;Korsyn&#8217;s 
thesis repeatedly returns to the desire for knowledge and insight&#8212;a continual 
process, a spinning out that resists closure, similar to definitions of metonym, 
not irony.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup><br>
<br>
[6] I hope the reader is starting to get a sense of the dramatically opposed 
interpretations of <i>Decentering Music</i>. Is it a scholarly comedy, 
resulting in an 
outdated &#8220;elegy&#8221; we should simply ignore? Or, is it a metonym based on imaginative tools of literary criticism 
whose timely arguments are impossible to ignore? I will suggest that not to read 
this book is to disregard one of the most provocative pieces of critical 
literature since Joseph Kerman&#8217;s <i>Contemplating Music</i>. As the similarities 
between the titles suggest, the mutual aim of each book is to change the field of 
musical scholarship, and any book that attempts such a feat is not to be missed. McCreless recognizes Korsyn&#8217;s bold intent to change the field, &#8220;The book is thus 
more than a little ambitious. But its ambition is backed up by a formidable 
intellect: Korsyn has an impressive command of musical scholarship of many 
stripes, and he brings to his task a formidable working knowledge and 
understanding of critical theory in the humanities outside the disciplines of 
music.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>			The reception of <i>Decentering Music</i> is also paralleled by that of 
<i>Contemplating Music</i>, which was quite controversial, possibly more than scholars 
recognize or remember, when it came out in 1985. </p>
<p>[7] I have a difficult time finding Korsyn&#8217;s ideas outdated. Perhaps because he 
engages dialogues between &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;new&#8221; musicology, reviewers may have assumed 
that he is talking about the &#8220;old&#8221; vs. &#8220;new&#8221; with the intention of giving one of 
these perspectives the authority to speak. But what Korsyn actually discusses is the 
pluralism that these arguments have generated and the lack of critical 
engagement in the 
subdisciplines.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>			And this hasn't been talked about. The 
criticism that Korsyn is addressing &#8220;old&#8221; vs. &#8220;new&#8221; musicology in the same way 
as authors in the 1990s or earlier overlooks the fact that those arguments 
sought to undermine the status quo of the &#8220;old&#8221; and situate the &#8220;new&#8221; musicology 
as a valid scholarly perspective. Korsyn is considering what has happened since 
the 
&#8220;new&#8221; musicology has been fully granted a seat at the table. He does not affirm 
or reject one of these partisan sides, but, more significantly, explores the 
&#8220;decentering&#8221; complicity of opposing perspectives. The discussion in Chapter 3 
about Kerman and Kofi Agawu most readily demonstrates this, but it is a 
continuous thread throughout the entire book. Others, like Mitchell Morris, seem 
to agree that the conflicts of the 1990s have continued to linger in frustrated 
ways, &#8220;Musicological tempers were short in the &#8216;90s, and only recently seem to 
have settled into a sullenness that still occasionally flares into the rancor.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
For these reasons and in light of recent related publications by Jairo Moreno 
and articles by Paul Attinello and Rose Rosengard Subotnik in <i>Beyond Structural 
Listening? Postmodern Modes of Hearing</i> (2004), these issues are far from being 
decades old.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
<p>[8] Even with a clearer idea about the historical relevance of Korsyn&#8217;s 
arguments, we seem to have, using Korsyn&#8217;s own language, a &#8220;radical plurality&#8221; 
of reviews. This is not to suggest that all reviews should engage a book in the 
same way, but here, I am tempted to consider some of them along further 
Korsynian lines, in light of the &#8220;Tower of Babel&#8221; metaphor Korsyn uses to describe the 
factionalization of musical scholarship. For example, a more conservative 
scholar like Williams argues from an outside perspective, viewing the book as an 
appropriation of inconsequential &#8220;litcrit,&#8221; wasting time by talking about how we 
talk about music. Given his opinion that we should ignore <i>Decentering Music</i>, it 
is probably safe to assume that he questions why one would bother with this sort 
of scholarship at all. Meanwhile, a more progressive scholar like Solie sees it 
as an attack on &#8220;new&#8221; musicology, and defends it in these terms. Korsyn, 
however, criticizes the &#8220;new&#8221; musicology from within; he uses the methods of 
&#8220;new&#8221; musicology to direct criticism back on itself (while critiquing &#8220;old&#8221; 
musicology as well). I think that one of the underlying reasons scholars have 
read <i>Decentering Music</i> so differently is that many of the ideas presented in it 
undermine their own positions. To accept these arguments is to accept a 
vulnerability of one&#8217;s own authority to speak, and this can make people very 
uncomfortable. We fight back using our familiar weapons of scholarly production 
(&#8220;old&#8221; or &#8220;new&#8221;), but this generates another &#8220;Tower of Babel.&#8221;</p>
<p>[9] It is also interesting that some of the criticisms of <i>Decentering Music</i> are 
anticipated in the book itself, which often attempts to predict the negative 
responses it evokes. Solie comments that, &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> for all the polemical use Korsyn has made in 
the previous chapter [Chapter 3] of the writings of ethnomusicologists, this 
chapter takes entirely for granted a musical &#8216;composition&#8217; in the European 
tradition, an object that can be represented and partitioned and discussed in 
stable spatial terms; it makes no reference whatsoever&#8212;nor does it allow for 
such reference&#8212;to any tradition in which music is conceived as experience or 
behaviour rather than object, in which no stability of referent is assumed nor 
Platonic form imagined.&#8221; But Korsyn appears to expect this type of criticism at 
the beginning of Chapter 4, &#8220;The Objects of Musical Research (1).&#8221; He writes, 
&#8220;Anthony Easthope has suggested a productive solution to this dilemma by 
invoking Saussure&#8217;s distinction between signifier and signified. A text has a 
relative identity as a collection of signifiers that can be transmitted in 
material form and repeated over time, but the signifieds can change <nobr>. . .</nobr> Easthope&#8217;s 
remarks illuminate not only literary texts but also all allographic arts, that 
is, all arts that depend on realization and exist in multiple performances. To 
specify the identity of anything that is subject to repeated performances, 
something must persist through all the different versions, remaining the same 
through time. But this invariant element is not a Platonic idea or essence, it 
is a set of signifiers. Thus even an electronic piece that exists in only one 
version would have only a relative identity, because its signifieds are also 
subject to change.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>			The refutation of competing ideas and criticisms as the book 
progresses is a refreshing strategy. Korsyn is fully aware that his own position 
can be deconstructed as easily as he deconstructs others, and he takes great 
efforts to address how his arguments can be turned on himself.</p>
<p>[10] There is another sense in which the book foreshadows the variance among certain reviews. McCreless disagrees with Korsyn&#8217;s assessment of the state of musical 
research, &#8220;Most pointedly, I simply don&#8217;t accept the &#8216;crisis,&#8217; as it is 
instantiated in Korsyn&#8217;s Tower of Babel&#8212;neither the claim as to when it happened 
or is happening, nor the claim as to how dire it is.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup>			On the other hand, Weliver 
believes, &#8220;The pioneering thought displayed in <i>Decentering Music</i> is so valuable 
because it can initiate larger discussion during a period when the international 
music research community faces visible threats. The &#8216;crisis&#8217; is not just 
external but internal. We do need to rethink how we practice criticism and what 
our professional practices are; opening up is much more desirable that closing 
down.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> Weliver finds the crisis multi-faceted, while McCreless denies there is a 
crisis. So, are we in a crisis or aren&#8217;t we? Korsyn speaks of the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of 
discourse in musical scholarship, and, indeed, the disagreements about the &#8220;crisis&#8221; and 
the contrasting ways scholars have read the book seem to affirm its existence. 
When Pascall concludes that <i>Decentering Music</i> will provide a &#8220;brighter 
musicological world <nobr>. . .</nobr> as a result of this brilliant, profound, compelling and 
important book,&#8221; and Furhmann believes, &#8220; <nobr>. . .</nobr> one will not easily find a more 
intelligent and discriminatingly thoughtful discussion partner than Korsyn, who 
despite all commitment to a position never argues pro domo,&#8221; but Solie sees it 
as &#8220;Musicologists Behaving Badly&#8221; (a reference to the Oxygen network&#8217;s comedy 
series, &#8220;Girls Behaving Badly,&#8221; in which women play practical jokes on 
unsuspecting people), something seems wrong.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> Of course, disagreement is the 
backbone of scholarship, but we can&#8217;t seem to agree on some very basic things, 
like the current state of our own discipline or relevant topics for scholarly 
pursuit. How can respected, accomplished scholars find the book so completely 
different in so many ways? If these varied reactions do not, themselves, 
indicate the &#8220;crisis&#8221; Korsyn is talking about, it is at least, for me, 
confusing. It also suggests that the book is worthy of serious contemplation by 
all in the field; our most important works tend to generate this type of 
polarized response.</p>
<p>[11] The most valuable aspect of <i>Decentering Music</i> is also what has prompted its 
most passionate reactions. The book forces us to reevaluate our own scholarly 
positions by questioning the authority of different perspectives to speak at the 
expense and neglect of others. This will probably be one of the themes that 
stays with us the longest and has the greatest significance. Korsyn&#8217;s ideas may 
also find relevance beyond musicology, ethnomusicology, and music theory. I have 
found certain concepts applicable to the field of music composition, and in her 
review, Margulis makes a number of insightful extensions of Korsyn&#8217;s ideas in 
relation to the field of music psychology and cognition.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>
<p>[12] In 1991, the field of Ethnomusicology was undergoing a restructuring of its 
most basic disciplinary commitments, similar to the &#8220;old&#8221; vs. &#8220;new&#8221; musicology 
debates that were flourishing in Theory and Historical Musicology. Judith Becker 
described this paradigm shift through a story from Clifford Geertz&#8217;s <i>The 
Interpretation of Cultures</i>, &#8220;The story goes like this: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>There is an Indian story&#8212;at least I heard it as an Indian story&#8212;about an 
Englishman who, having been told that the world rested on a platform which 
rested on the back of an elephant which rested in turn on the back of a turtle 
asked <nobr>. . .</nobr> what did the turtle rest on?<br>Another turtle.<br>Another turtle?<br>&#8216;Ah, Sahib, after that it is turtles all the way down.&#8217;&#8221;<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Becker challenged the supplanting of traditional ideas of ethnomusicology by 
showing that, &#8220;Perspectivism forbids us to claim the last word, as the turtle 
story precludes a final turtle.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> If the &#8220;new&#8221; stood on equal footing with the 
&#8220;old,&#8221; it was supported by its own foundational shell. Since this time, we have 
discovered and discussed a lot of turtles. Instead of adding another, Korsyn 
seems to saying that there are no turtles&#8212;an idea that, however unsettling, 
suggests a new and exciting outlook for musical scholarship.</p>
