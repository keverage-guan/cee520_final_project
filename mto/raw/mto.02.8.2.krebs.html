<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] David Ferris&rsquo;s book is one of several studies of Robert Schumann and his 
  music that have recently appeared with Oxford University Press.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
  </font> Focusing on one of the most fascinating genres in which this composer 
  worked, and on perhaps the most beautiful of his examples of that genre (the 
  Eichendorff <i>Liederkreis,</i> op. 39), Ferris&rsquo;s book is a welcome addition 
  to Oxford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Schumann series.&rdquo; It is refreshing to read a study of the Romantic 
  song cycle whose primary focus is not <i>Dichterliebe</i> (which is by far the 
  most frequently analysed Romantic song cycle). Numerous earlier writers have 
  argued that <i>Dichterliebe</i> is an organically unified cycle, and have used 
  their analyses of this cycle as the basis for a model of unity and coherence, 
  which, they imply, is applicable to the Romantic song cycle in general. Ferris 
  has deliberately chosen to emphasize a cycle to which such a model cannot easily 
  be applied (although previous writers have, in accordance with established views 
  of what constitutes a cycle, sought to explain even op. 39 as &ldquo;an integrated 
  musical whole that is unified by a web of motivic relationships and a symmetrical 
  arrangement of keys&rdquo; [page 4]). Ferris attempts instead to approach the work without 
  preconceptions about unity and coherence, and in a manner consistent with the 
  aesthetics of the period in which it originated. The result is an interpretation 
  of op. 39&mdash;and of the Romantic cycle in general&mdash;that diverges significantly 
  from those of earlier writers. Instead of asking, &ldquo;How is Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39 
  unified?,&rdquo; Ferris addresses the following questions: (1) What is the Romantic 
  view of unity and coherence in the song cycle? (2) How does this view compare 
  with current conceptions of unity and coherence in the cycle? (3) How could 
  the latter conceptions be complemented and modified by taking into consideration 
  the Romantic view? In his effort to answer these questions, Ferris consults 
  a wide variety of sources: nineteenth-century writings on aesthetics and philosophy; 
  nineteenth-century music journal articles (including Schumann&rsquo;s own writings); 
  the 20<sup>th</sup>-century theoretical and musicological literature 
  on Schumann&rsquo;s song cycles and the song cycle in general; Schumann&rsquo;s autographs; 
  and, of course, the text and music of Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39.</p>
<p> [2] In his first chapter, Ferris establishes a context for his investigation 
  by describing three trends in recent research on the Romantic song cycle. The 
  adherents of one trend, including Arthur Komar, David Neumeyer, and Patrick 
  McCreless, consider cycles in theoretical terms, and attempt to discover unity 
  and coherence within them.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
  A second trend, originating in part as a reaction against the first, involves 
  the investigation of the historical context of, and contemporary perspectives 
  on the Romantic cycle.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
  Whereas Ferris finds this endeavor laudable, he notes that it has not resulted 
  in any significant change in current conceptions of the song cycle, partly because 
  the scholars in this group have brought to their investigations a preconception 
  similar to that held by the first group&mdash;the belief that true cycles involve 
  some kind of musical coherence, particularly tonal coherence. The third trend, 
  which more closely approaches Ferris&rsquo;s viewpoint, is that represented by recent 
  writings of John Daverio and Charles Rosen.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>  </font> Both of these authors begin to consider Romantic cycles in connection 
  with aesthetic and philosophical trends of the early nineteenth century, in 
  particular, the ideas of the brothers Wilhelm and August Schlegel. Ferris contends 
  that neither Daverio nor Rosen goes far enough in the exploration of the Schlegel 
  connection; one of the purposes of his book is further to pursue that avenue.</p>
<p>[3] In his critique of earlier writings on the cycle, Ferris consistently acknowledges 
  their valuable aspects, while arguing for a supplementation of their findings 
  by a different approach. This attitude of tolerance and fairness remains in 
  effect in his second chapter, entitled &ldquo;Analysing <i>Dichterliebe</i>,&rdquo; in which 
  he provides critiques of Schenkerian analyses by Schenker himself, by Arthur 
  Komar, and by David Neumeyer. He notes the difficulties and contradictions that 
  arise from the analysts&rsquo; attempts to fit the complexities of individual songs, 
  or the tonal plans of the entire cycle, into a mold of organic unity. He points 
  out, for example, how Schenker, in his analysis of the second song of <i>Dichterliebe,</i> 
  uses his graphic notation in a curious way, apparently in order to draw attention 
  to unusual aspects of Schumann&rsquo;s cadences. For instance, Schenker notates the 
  dominant harmony of the penultimate bar as a half note, and the final tonic 
  that resolves it as a quarter note. Ferris believes that this strange notation, 
  which suggests the priority of the dominant over the tonic, may be an attempt 
  to represent &ldquo;Schumann&rsquo;s subversion of the seemingly straightforward syntax 
  of his cadence&rdquo; (page 46)&mdash;this final cadence in which the dominant is so strongly 
  emphasized, and the tonic is presented, almost as an afterthought, by the piano 
  alone. Ferris&rsquo;s perceptive remarks on Schenker&rsquo;s sketch contain one error: he 
  misreads Schenker&rsquo;s intention with respect to measure 8 (on the foreground level). 
  He states (page 43) that Schenker analyses the same cadence in different ways&mdash;in 
  measure 4, as an authentic cadence, and in measure 8 as a half-cadence. Actually, Schenker 
  writes &ldquo;Wdh&rdquo; (Wiederholung) after his sketch of measures 1&ndash;4, indicating that the 
  same phrase, concluding with an authentic cadence, is heard twice. The dominant 
  in measure 8, which Schenker attaches to a beam, is not the one that begins that 
  bar (the V within the authentic cadence), but the one that follows the authentic 
  cadence (the dominant harmony that begins the middle section).</p>
<p>[4] In spite of his criticisms of some of the work on the song cycle by Schenkerian 
  theorists, Ferris admits the value of Schenkerian analysis, and himself employs 
  Schenkerian sketches throughout the volume as a way of explaining foreground 
  and middleground voice-leading in the songs of Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39. His own Schenkerian 
  sketches are, for the most part, well prepared; I have located only a few errors. 
  In Example 4.3, a durational reduction of measures 10&ndash;18 of op. 39 no. 1 (page 105), <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
  should yield to E in the last beat of the first bar (which corresponds to measure 
  12 of the song), as is evident in the score from the top notes of the left-hand 
  accompaniment figure. Because Ferris delays the melodic motion to E, the voice 
  leading in the sketch is faulty; there are parallel fifths in the treble voices 
  between the first two bars of Example 4.3c.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Example 5.5 (page 135) contains a typographical error; the G natural in the 
  bass near the end should be a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>. In Example 6.3 (page 154), the last two notes in 
  Ferris&rsquo;s progression of the descending fifths in the bass do not make musical 
  sense; the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> in measure 55 does not, as the sketch indicates, move to the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> of 
  measure 59, but resolves immediately to E. In any case, the bass notes of measures 55 
  and 59 are bass notes of first-inversion harmonies, and thus do not logically 
  connect to the earlier bass notes, which are roots within a circle-of-fifths 
  progression.</p>
<p>[5] Although he employs Schenkerian analysis, Ferris&rsquo;s overall perspective 
  on the song cycle is by no means Schenkerian; it is instead derived from early 
  nineteenth-century writings on aesthetics, philosophy, and music, which he summarizes 
  in his third chapter (&ldquo;Schlegel&rsquo;s Fragments and Schumann&rsquo;s Cycles&rdquo;). He argues 
  that although organicism was not an unfamiliar concept in the early nineteenth 
  century, the kind of organic unity that is today often sought in the song cycle&mdash;a 
  unity &ldquo;in which all elements are completely integrated and interdependent&rdquo; and 
  &ldquo;in which the alteration of even a single detail would destroy the integrity 
  of the whole&rdquo; (page 61)&mdash;was alien to the Romanticists&rsquo; view of their own art. 
  He demonstrates that Friedrich and August Schlegel, whose theories of literature 
  deeply influenced Schumann, conceived of the Romantic artwork as being imperfect 
  and fragmentary, groping for a new, as yet unachieved Utopian unity (page 69). 
  He summarizes the Schlegels&rsquo; metaphorical descriptions of Romantic works of 
  art as fragments, silhouettes and sketches&mdash;metaphors suggestive of incompleteness 
  and imperfection.</p>
<p>[6] The Schlegels&rsquo; theories are, as Ferris shows in the second part of the 
  third chapter, analogous to Schumann&rsquo;s ideas about Romantic music, as articulated 
  in the <i>Neue Zeitschrift.</i><sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
  </font>For example, in analogy to Schlegel&rsquo;s view that literature was in the 
  process of arriving at a new Utopian condition, Schumann alludes to a state 
  of transition in music&mdash;a progression toward a more perfect future state (page 
  74)&mdash;and describes the genres of his time as transitional, fluid, and flexible. 
  Given Schumann&rsquo;s Schlegelian view of Romantic genres, Ferris argues, it is unwise 
  to attempt to define the Romantic cycle as a particular type of work (for example, 
  as necessarily possessing a particular type of key scheme, a network of motivic 
  interconnections, etc.). There are no conventions for the Romantic song cycle 
  analogous to those of the Classical sonata; it is a genre &ldquo;that embodies the 
  confusion and imperfection of Schlegel&rsquo;s Romantic style&rdquo; (page 75) and that is 
  &ldquo;ripe for further growth and development&rdquo; (page 77).</p>
<p>[7] Since Schumann himself wrote very little about the song cycle specifically, 
  Ferris must look to the writings of other music journalists of the time to gain 
  a clearer insight into the Romantic view of the song cycle. He approaches these 
  writings with care, in the awareness that they are often written with a lay 
  public in mind, and that they may therefore lack precision and depth. He also 
  cautions that to avoid misinterpretations, we must not bring to these writings 
  any current preconceptions about the nature of a song cycle. He points out that 
  Barbara Turchin&rsquo;s comprehensive survey of early nineteenth-century song reviews 
  is marred by a &ldquo;misleading sense of historical coherence&rdquo; (page 78). Since she 
  assumes that song cycles must be coherent works, and that tonal structure is 
  the most significant aspect of their coherence, she places undue weight on any 
  mention of key relationships, with the result that her assessment of the historical 
  significance of certain reviews is slanted. Ferris, interpreting Schumann&rsquo;s 
  and other writers&rsquo; allusions to key relationships more objectively, finds no 
  evidence that nineteenth-century authors privileged tonal structure over other 
  elements in their definition of &ldquo;cycle-hood.&rdquo; Ferris discovers, in fact, that 
  nineteenth-century music critics rarely broach the issue of the musical coherence 
  or unity of a set of songs. Where the issue does arise, it is linked with the 
  degree in which individual songs could stand alone. The coherence of a cycle 
  appears to be determined, in the eyes of these critics, by features of the individual 
  parts of the cycle rather than by those of the &ldquo;cycle as a whole.&rdquo; Ferris&rsquo;s 
  scrutiny of nineteenth-century writings thus paves the way for a view of song 
  cycles as collections of open-ended quasi-fragmentary structures, where the 
  collection itself is not a unified, but a &ldquo;discontinuous and heterogeneous&rdquo; 
  whole (page 86)&mdash;a larger-scale fragment replete with unrealized implications.</p>
<p> [8] Ferris&rsquo;s generally insightful discussions of nineteenth-century writings 
  are occasionally marred by problems with the German language. Frequent typographical 
  errors in transcriptions of German texts are merely slight irritants,<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup>  </font>but there are also some serious errors in translation. In his translation 
  of Oswald Lorenz&rsquo;s review of six songs by Ferdinand Hiller, for example (pages 
  78&ndash;79), Ferris refers to a hint within the &ldquo;wording&rdquo; (i.e., the texts) at a 
  delicate &ldquo;elective affinity&rdquo; between songs. On page 80, Ferris interprets this 
  supposed statement about the &ldquo;wording&rdquo; as follows: &ldquo;[Lorenz] suggests that &lsquo;the 
  words of the individual song consist only of scarce hints&rsquo;.&rdquo; The original text, 
  however, does not mention the &ldquo;wording&rdquo; at all. Lorenz writes that &ldquo;das Formelle&rdquo; 
  (the formal, or structural aspect) barely hints at the fact that the individual 
  songs are links in a chain rather than isolated entities, and goes on to mention 
  the subtle musical means by which the songs are prevented from acting as independent, 
  closed works. Lorenz&rsquo;s term &ldquo;das Formelle&rdquo; refers, judging by the context, to 
  musical rather than textual structure, and Ferris&rsquo;s references to &ldquo;wording&rdquo; 
  miss the point.</p>
<p>[9] Later within the same translation, Ferris writes: &ldquo;The first song could 
  be considered as an independent entity, but this could not be justified for 
  the others.&rdquo; Lorenz makes no such statement about the first song. His argument 
  is that an inconclusive musical cadence, justified in the first song by the 
  question that ends its text, is not textually justified in any other song; the 
  composer&rsquo;s use of such a cadence in the second song is not motivated by the 
  text, but by the desire to create a subtle connection between adjacent songs.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup></p>
<p>[10] Similar errors occur in the final chapter (&ldquo;The Song Cycle as Literary 
  Work&rdquo;), in which Ferris returns to the nineteenth-century periodical literature 
  to demonstrate that the song cycle was regarded at that time not as a narrative 
  or a dramatic, but a purely lyric genre. Ferris claims on page 199, for example, 
  that Schumann criticizes Loewe and Schubert &ldquo;for expressing too much of the 
  &ldsquo;material&rsquo; world in their songs.&rdquo; But what Schumann actually writes is that 
  Schubert, Loewe and many of the &ldquo;newer&rdquo; composers &ldquo;often apply [their paint] 
  too thickly&rdquo; (&ldquo;oft zu materiell auftragen&rdquo;); the word &ldquo;auftragen&rdquo; is generally 
  used in connection with paint, and the word &ldquo;materiell&rdquo; here refers not to the 
  material world, but to an excess of matter, i.e., an overly thick or detailed 
  texture.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>[11] The most serious mistranslation in the book occurs within the same chapter. 
  Ferris presents the following translation of an excerpt from a three-part essay 
  on Lieder by Carl Banck (page 196&mdash;emphases from the original essay):</p>
<dir> 
  <dir> 
    <p>One feels the <i>contrivance,</i> the <i>experience,</i> the <i>craft</i> 
      in these compositions; they are the lieder of those <i>practiced</i> composers, 
      who have the <i>greatest ease</i> in handling the ordinary methods as well 
      as their own characteristic methods for rendering the <i>truth</i> of feeling 
      in music. The concern here is not the rebirth of poetry into the more beautiful 
      and glowing life of song; rather, the composer has interpreted the words 
      in his musical language, whose fluency provides his eloquence. He shrouds 
      the radiant glances of his spirit with the fog of serenity, and expresses 
      poetic language instead of literary ideas.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>Here, Ferris has actually turned a negative, or at best lukewarm, statement 
  into a positive one. The context of the admittedly somewhat confusing excerpt 
  clarifies its intent. Part I of Banck&rsquo;s essay ends with satirical accounts of 
  various classes of bad song composers. In Part II (which is the source of Ferris&rsquo;s 
  excerpt), Banck presents three &ldquo;stereotypical reviews&rdquo; of different types of 
  songs, in order from worst to best&mdash;but it is evident that even the last review, 
  from which the excerpt in question is taken, is not meant to be positive. This 
  fact emerges most clearly in an annotated list of relevant songs that follows 
  the review; the annotations consist of a mixture of positive and negative remarks. 
  Banck&rsquo;s language within the review itself is to a large extent negative as well. 
  The term &ldquo;Gemachte&rdquo;, which Ferris renders correctly as &ldquo;contrivance&rdquo;, sets the 
  tone; Banck cannot be referring to good songs! Ferris&rsquo;s &ldquo;experience&rdquo; is not 
  a correct translation of Banck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Routine&rdquo;, which could better be rendered by 
  its English cognate. The sentence that in Ferris&rsquo;s translation begins &ldquo;The concern 
  here<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo; should be rendered as follows: &ldquo;Here one is not confronted with the 
  rebirth of poetry into the more beautiful and blossoming life of song [this 
  would evidently be Banck&rsquo;s ideal]; rather, the composer has turned the words 
  into translators of his musical language, the fluency of which he takes for 
  eloquence.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>  Banck is clearly being critical of a category of Lieder in which the words are 
  subservient to an overly facile musical language. The final sentence of the 
  excerpt is similarly negative in intent; a correct translation would be: &ldquo;He 
  shrouds the radiant glances of his spirit with the fog of equanimity, and presents 
  flowery poetic language instead of poetic ideas.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
  Given such mistranslation, Ferris&rsquo;s commentary on the excerpt is, of course, 
  wide of the mark; the excerpt is by no means meant to represent the &ldquo;highest 
  attainment&rdquo; of Banck&rsquo;s ideals, as he claims. </p>
<p>[12] In spite of such flaws, Ferris&rsquo;s discussions of nineteenth-century criticism 
  successfully provide a context for his analysis of Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39, and for 
  the search for a historically based model of the song cycle that underlies this 
  analysis. During his analysis of the cycle, Ferris does not discuss the songs 
  in order, but instead opts for a more imaginative organization based in part 
  on relationships between pairs of songs. This apparently &ldquo;disorderly&rdquo; method 
  of analyzing the cycle is appropriate, given that Ferris is attempting to present 
  an alternative to the common view of the cycle as an organic, coherent work; 
  if one puts that view aside, there is no particular reason to analyse the twelve 
  songs in order.</p>
<p>[13] Not only does Ferris not analyse the songs of the cycle in order, but 
  he does not analyse all of the songs. In the fourth chapter (&ldquo;Poem and Song&rdquo;), 
  he provides a detailed analysis of the first song (&ldquo;In der Fremde&rdquo;), including 
  a discussion of an early version, and of the cheery <i>Wanderlied</i> (&ldquo;Der 
  frohe Wandersmann&rdquo;) that Schumann originally intended as the opener and later 
  published separately. In the fifth chapter (&ldquo;Weak Openings&rdquo;), Ferris deals in 
  equal detail with &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; (no. 2) and &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo; (no. 12), and 
  in the sixth chapter (&ldquo;Recompositional Pairings&rdquo;) with &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;(no. 5) and 
  &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; (no. 6). Ferris discusses the remaining seven songs of 
  the cycle in much less detail, or not at all. He deals briefly with the texts 
  of &ldquo;Waldesgespr&auml;ch&rdquo; (no. 3),&ldquo;Die Stille&rdquo; (no. 4), &ldquo;Wehmuth&rdquo; (no. 9), &ldquo;Zwielicht&rdquo; 
  (no. 10) and &ldquo;Im Walde&rdquo; (no. 11) in his final chapter. From the fact that he 
  does not mention Songs 7 and 8 at all, one might deduce that these songs somehow 
  do not fit into his interpretation of the cycle. That is not the case; analysis 
  of these songs might even have strengthened Ferris&rsquo;s arguments (see below).</p>
<p>[14] As is evident from the above listing, Ferris informs his musical analysis 
  with perceptive textual analysis. His commentary on the Eichendorff poems is 
  enlightening; he is familiar with recent criticism of the poet&rsquo;s works, and 
  also provides interesting original insights. Whereas earlier writers about op. 
  39 have simply noted the recurrence of certain images in the poems (&ldquo;murmuring 
  brooks, rustling treetops, moonlit fields, and singing nightingales&rdquo;&mdash;page 212), 
  Ferris interprets many of these images as symbols. He argues that Eichendorff&rsquo;s 
  landscape, in a &ldquo;continual state of dynamic motion&rdquo;, symbolizes &ldquo;the inner growth 
  of the lyric subject&rdquo; (page 212)&mdash;a growth that is to culminate in the transcendence 
  of the real world and in a union with nature. The bird images in &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo;, 
  &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Die Stille&rdquo; represent a striving toward this transcendence&mdash;a 
  taking flight toward an elusive spiritual realm (page 213). The night (in &ldquo;Die 
  Stille&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;) is &ldquo;a 
  time of spiritual transcendence, when we can feel our souls become one with 
  nature&rdquo; (page 216). The dusk, which dominates the songs &ldquo;Waldesgespr&auml;ch&rdquo;, 
  &ldquo;Zwielicht&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Im Walde&rdquo;, on the other hand, is a time of &ldquo;deception and 
  terror, when nothing is as it appears&rdquo; (page 216). Such interpretations, which 
  sound odd when mentioned out of context, become very convincing once one becomes 
  immersed in the poetry and in Ferris&rsquo;s explications.</p>
<p>[15] In Ferris&rsquo;s poetic analyses, unlike in his discussions of critical writings, 
  there are no serious difficulties with the German language. I believe, however, 
  that Ferris misinterprets the last line of the first poem of op. 39 (&ldquo;In der 
  Fremde&rdquo;). He states correctly that the poem begins with &ldquo;a sober assessment 
  of an unhappy reality&rdquo;, and then &ldquo;transform[s]<nobr> . . . </nobr>to a dreamy anticipation of<nobr> . . . </nobr>death.&rdquo; 
  He feels that the final line of the poem (&ldquo;Und Keiner mehr kennt mich auch hier&rdquo;&mdash;And 
  nobody knows me here, either) returns the narrator to reality. The desired closure 
  of death cannot be achieved; it is the anxious loneliness of the present that 
  is closing her in&rdquo; (page 96).<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
  </font> I read the final line quite differently. From line 5 onward, Eichendorff 
  implies the future tense while using the present&mdash;a technique that is appropriate 
  for a &ldquo;dreamlike anticipation&rdquo; (in the present) of a future event. Ferris correctly 
  translates the fifth line (&ldquo;Wie bald, wie bald kommt die stille Zeit&rdquo;) with 
  the future tense (&ldquo;How soon, how soon will come the peaceful time&rdquo;), but he 
  fails to maintain this future tense through the last line. There is no shift 
  in time or in tense between the seventh and the final lines. The final line 
  is thus not an &ldquo;uncomfortable intrusion&rdquo; of the present into the narrator&rsquo;s 
  dreamlike anticipation of the future (page 96), but a continuation of the anticipation 
  of death that began with the fifth line.</p>
<p> [16] This misinterpretation of the poem affects Ferris&rsquo;s musical analysis 
  of the song. Attempting to show that Schumann &ldquo;makes explicit the implied break 
  between lines 5&ndash;7 and line 8&rdquo; (page 97), he argues that the musical material for 
  line 8 (measures 21&ndash;25), while sounding like a coda, can also be interpreted as the 
  second A section of a ternary form Setting line 8 to a second A section would 
  indeed have created a powerful musical break, matching the supposed poetic break, 
  between lines 7 and 8. But the music actually has none of the character of a 
  returning A section; there is no hint at the harmonic progression of the opening, 
  and the melodic reference to the opening is subtle rather than overt. With its 
  tonic pedal and its veiled reference to the melody of the opening section, this 
  music sounds like a coda, and nothing but a coda. The fact that there is a cadence 
  before this music does create a break, but because the tonic-prolonging coda 
  flows naturally out of the cadential tonic, the break is not as strong as Ferris 
  would have it.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>
<p>[17] Most of Ferris&rsquo;s musical analysis is, however, very convincing, and it 
  grows out of equally convincing poetic analysis. Just as he is able to probe 
  beneath the apparent simplicity of the poetry, so does he locate ambiguities 
  and complexities in Schumann&rsquo;s deceptively simple musical settings. He shows 
  that what appears to be musical closure is often tinged with openness&mdash;an apt 
  response to the unfulfilled yearning for transcendence that pervades Eichendorff&rsquo;s 
  poetry. For example, the final cadence to the tonic in &ldquo;In der Fremde&rdquo; comes 
  earlier than expected (measure 21), and thus cannot function as a satisfying close. 
  During the following coda, because of Schumann&rsquo;s use of the Phrygian <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in the 
  melody (which could be <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>6</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in B minor), and because of his use of the major mode 
  in the harmony, the prolonged tonic takes on some dominant flavor; hence this 
  coda points forward rather than acting as a point of rest and closure (page 107). 
  Ferris shows that near the end of the second song (&ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo;), while the 
  voice states a strong <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> descent (measures 24&ndash;25), the piano overlaps with 
  a statement of the opening melody, resulting in a striking conflation of closing 
  and opening gestures (pages 138&ndash;39). In &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;, closure is undermined by 
  the non-simultaneity of the voice&rsquo;s and the piano&rsquo;s final cadences, in measures 59 
  and 61, respectively (page 156). Ferris hears even the ending of the final song 
  (&ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;), which is generally interpreted as a point of glowing 
  fulfillment, as an open ending. The inconclusive aspects that he lists are: 
  the incompleteness of the melodic descent from <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>, which is initiated in measures 
  22&ndash;24, but is deflected after <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> (the voice leaping back up to <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>, then moving 
  directly down to <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>); the resulting parallel octaves with the bass (<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> against 
  V&ndash;I)&mdash;a contrapuntally weak cadence; and the substitution of V<sup>7</sup>/IV for the cadential 
  tonic in measure 26.</p>
<p>[18] Ferris describes complexities and ambiguities in the openings of a number 
  of the songs as well; he argues, in fact, that it is largely the prevalence 
  of weak openings that &ldquo;gives the Eichendorff <i>Liederkreis </i>its individual 
  stamp&rdquo; (page 122). Ferris&rsquo;s term &ldquo;weak opening&rdquo; encompasses a variety of situations, 
  all of which involve fragile initial tonic harmonies (page 121). In the fifth 
  chapter (which is entitled &ldquo;Weak Openings&rdquo;), Ferris discusses &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; and 
  &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;, both of which begin with weakly established tonics, and 
  in both of which the first sections end with strong cadences to V, with the 
  result that those sections are end- rather than beginning-accented. In the sixth 
  chapter (&ldquo;Recompositional Pairings&rdquo;), Ferris designates the openings of &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; 
  and &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; as weak for quite different reasons. &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; begins 
  with an &ldquo;open-ended fragment that is repeated&rdquo; and that &ldquo;arouses the expectation 
  of more forceful motion&rdquo; later in the song (page 153). The opening of &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne 
  Fremde&rdquo;, on the other hand, is weak in the sense that it begins in the middle 
  of a sequential progression. Ferris shows how the second strophe of &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne 
  Fremde&rdquo; (beginning in measure 7) clarifies this feature of the opening by preceding 
  the initial sequence with two additional segments (page 160). By extending his 
  initial sequence backward, Schumann conceals the return of the opening (measure 11), 
  and causes in the listener a sense of disorientation&mdash;&ldquo;a vague sense that we 
  know where we are and that it is somewhere familiar, but we cannot be sure why&rdquo;&mdash;which 
  beautifully matches the confused message that the poet hears the night delivering 
  to him.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>
<p>[19] A central aspect of Ferris&rsquo;s analyses in the fifth and sixth chapters 
  is his recognition that Schumann explores similar structural devices in pairs 
  of songs. He shows that &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo; are similar in 
  form (ternary, with one-bar introductions and five-bar codas) and in harmonic 
  plan (the initial A section begins with a weakly defined tonic and leads to 
  a strong cadence to V; in the final A&rsquo; section, the tonic is strengthened, and 
  the section ends with the song&rsquo;s only perfect authentic cadence). Ferris also 
  demonstrates that in &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo;, Schumann recomposes the underlying 
  structure of the preceding song, &ldquo;Mondnacht.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>  Both songs are bar forms (although, as was mentioned above, the repetition of 
  the initial section is concealed in &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo;). There are numerous 
  harmonic relationships as well. The two songs begin with very similar sequential 
  progressions. In both, a weak opening leads, through a hypermetrically weak 
  root position tonic, to a cadence to the dominant, and the final section ends 
  with a climactic cadence to the tonic (the only such cadence in each of the 
  songs). Ferris reinforces his arguments about these song-pairings by showing 
  that the texts of the paired songs are related as well. The texts of &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo; 
  and &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo;, in most respects quite different, at least share the theme 
  of transcendence. The texts of &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; are night 
  poems involving &ldquo;Romantic moments of epiphany&mdash;characterized by the narrator&rsquo;s 
  sensation that all of nature has attained consciousness and that he is merging 
  with the nocturnal world that surrounds him&rdquo; (page 144).</p>
<p>[20] After presenting his analyses, Ferris returns (at the end of the sixth 
  chapter) to one of the broad questions with which his book is concerned&mdash;the 
  question of the extent to which, and the manner in which a Romantic song cycle 
  can be coherent. He arrives at the following answer: &ldquo;It is not simply the use 
  of closely related keys or similar melodic motives that associates the songs&mdash;but 
  the exploration of the same set of compositional ideas and the use of the same 
  formal strategies&rdquo; (page 165). This conclusion leads Ferris, at the end of the 
  sixth chapter, and in greater detail in the seventh, to a consideration of Schumann&rsquo;s 
  process of composing song cycles. He notes that Schumann usually composed the 
  songs of a cycle very quickly&mdash;an observation that is connected to the aforementioned 
  cohesive features of op. 39, for &ldquo;it seems almost inevitable that a group of 
  songs composed in this way would share the same stylistic and formal characteristics&rdquo; 
  (page 167).</p>
<p>[21] Ferris&rsquo;s detailed investigation of Schumann&rsquo;s process of composing a cycle 
  in Chapter 7 brings forth numerous additional insights. First, Ferris discovers 
  that the common categorization of groups of songs as either collections or cycles, 
  with corresponding differences in compositional procedure, is simplistic. The 
  belief that the order of the songs within a cycle is vitally important has led 
  to the assumption that order of composition is significant in cycles, but not 
  in collections. It is often assumed that Schumann determined the order of the 
  songs of a cycle while he composed the songs, but that he did not do so when 
  a group of songs was to be merely a &ldquo;collection.&rdquo; Ferris shows, however, that 
  only in the Heine <i>Liederkreis</i> (op. 24) and in <i>Frauenliebe- und Leben 
  </i>did<i> </i>Schumann compose the songs in the order of publication; in all 
  other sets written during 1840&ndash;41, whether or not he designated them as cycles, 
  he wrote the individual songs first, and only then, over a longer period of 
  time, considered the order in which they were to be published. The fact that 
  there is no clear difference between his compositional procedures in the case 
  of cycles and collections suggests that the distinction between cycles (regarded 
  by earlier authors as organically unified) and collections (where no organic 
  unity is expected) was not as important to Schumann as most recent authors have 
  argued.</p>
<p>[22] Ferris&rsquo;s discovery of a two-stage process in song cycle composition is 
  an important contribution of this chapter. His evidence for this process is 
  a three-volume set of bound and dated autographs, collected by Schumann himself 
  for the purposes of a gift for his bride.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>  </font>He demonstrates the two-stage process in the composition of the <i>Zw&ouml;lf 
  Lieder aus F. R&uuml;ckerts Liebesfr&uuml;hling</i> (op. 37) and in <i>Myrthen</i> 
  (op. 25), then turns to the complex case of op. 39. He arrives at a plausible 
  hypothesis for the compositional history of the cycle, which again involves 
  a two-stage process (although this cycle is unique because Clara Schumann rather 
  than Robert selected the poems from Eichendorff&rsquo;s complete works). Ferris speculates 
  on the logic behind Schumann&rsquo;s compositional order, showing, for example, how 
  Schumann worked out a particular compositional idea&mdash;the weak opening&mdash;in increasingly 
  complex ways in the three consecutively composed songs &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intermezzo&rdquo; 
  and &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde.&rdquo; He compares this way of working with that of a visual 
  artist drawing a number of sketches, each of which explore the same ideas and 
  techniques. He stresses, however, that the existence of such compositional logic 
  does not mean that Schumann ever intended to arrange and publish the songs in 
  the order in which they were composed.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
  He shows that Schumann first wrote three songs with strong, then three with 
  weak openings, which became the first six songs of the cycle, and then arranged 
  them in an order in which strong and weak openings alternate. Unlike earlier 
  writers, Ferris makes no effort to arrive at a comprehensive musical rationale 
  for the order in which Schumann eventually did publish the Eichendorff songs. 
  This avoidance of discussion of the &ldquo;cycle as a whole&rdquo; accords with Ferris&rsquo;s 
  belief that there is no single principle of musical coherence in this or any 
  Romantic cycle.</p>
<p>[23] In his final chapter (&ldquo;The Song Cycle as a Literary Work&rdquo;), Ferris approaches 
  the &ldquo;cycle as a whole&rdquo; from a poetic standpoint. In doing so, he follows the 
  lead of early nineteenth-century critics, who, on those rare occasions when 
  they discussed the creation of a cycle from a series of songs, emphasized the 
  literary, not the musical aspect of the cycle. Whereas modern critics frequently 
  dwell on the text of the cycle as well, they generally attempt to interpret 
  it as a continuous narrative or a monodrama, and refer to those cycles (like 
  Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39) that lack a plot or a consistent protagonist as anomalies. 
  Ferris counters this expectation for plots and narratives with the observation 
  that in the nineteenth century, the song cycle was considered a lyric, not a 
  dramatic genre. He points out that not even those cycles that generally are 
  considered to encompass a coherent narrative, like <i>Dichterliebe,</i> are 
  narratives pure and simple. <i>Dichterliebe,</i> he argues, is not a coherent 
  love story, but a series of emotional and psychological responses to the experience 
  of love and loss; &ldquo;the sequence of the cycle does not depend upon the logical 
  conventions of storytelling but on the far more elusive laws that govern the 
  unconscious realm of dream and memory&rdquo; (page 205).</p>
<p>[24] Ferris shows that while previous writers have acknowledged that the Eichendorff 
  cycle is less clearly a narrative than <i>Dichterliebe,</i> they have nevertheless 
  attempted to impose narratives of a sort upon it. Adorno, Turchin, Thym and 
  Daverio, for example, have viewed the cycle as a coherent progression of moods, 
  and thus as following a quasi-narrative curve.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 
  </font> Thym also hints at an autobiographical narrative, an idea that McCreless 
  pursues further; both authors interpret the poetic texts in relation to Schumann&rsquo;s 
  impending marriage.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> 
  Ferris entirely abandons a narrative approach, instead exploring the network 
  of symbols relating to the yearning for transcendence that pervades the poems. 
  This exploration leads him to further insights about Schumann&rsquo;s order of publication 
  of the songs. He notes that Schumann placed in each half of the cycle at least 
  one song of the evening (recall that evening is associated in Eichendorff&rsquo;s 
  poetry with present insecurity and fear), and ends each half with a song of 
  the night (symbolizing the yearning for future transcendence). Thus Ferris views 
  the cycle of twelve songs not as a single curve leading from negative to positive 
  sensations, but as a twofold progression from negative to positive, from present 
  to future&mdash;as &ldquo;an open-ended cycle, whose two arches could potentially continue 
  in either direction&rdquo; (page 221).</p>
<p>[25] Strangely enough, Ferris follows this new and original view of op. 39 
  with a reversion to an approach that has characterized most earlier studies: 
  the search for recurrent motives. To be sure, he broaches a conception of motive 
  that is somewhat different from that of earlier authors; he is not content with 
  locating melodic ideas that recur in a number of songs, but also takes into 
  account rhythm and meter, texture, and harmonic and contrapuntal context. His 
  sole original example of this more comprehensive view of motive is an idea that 
  occurs at climactic points in the third strophes of both &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; 
  and &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;&mdash;the final songs of the aforementioned two &ldquo;arches.&rdquo; 
  In measure 21 of the former song (in the voice) and measure 24 of the latter (in the piano), 
  Schumann presents rising leaps followed by descending stepwise lines. Ferris 
  states that the two ideas are similar not only in contour but also in textural 
  treatment; they are the only points in the respective songs where voice and 
  right hand are in unison. This statement is, unfortunately, inaccurate with 
  respect to measure 24 of &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;; first, there was already a unison 
  passage in measure 12, and furthermore, only a small portion of the melodic gesture 
  is in unison in measure 24, so that the similarity to measure 21 of &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; 
  (where the entire melodic gesture in question is presented in unison) is minimal. 
  Thus, Ferris actually provides no convincing examples of his new type of motive. 
  His discussion of motives in the cycle is so sketchy that one wonders why it 
  is included at all.</p>
<p>[26] Ferris concludes his book with a brief summary of what he considers the 
  main elements of his approach to the Romantic cycle: the abandonment of the 
  attempt to analyse the Romantic cycle as a unified whole, with a corresponding 
  emphasis on the individual songs, with their various suggestions and implications; 
  his emphasis on the symbolic meaning of the text; his taking into consideration 
  of Schumann&rsquo;s two-stage compositional process; and finally, his consideration 
  of the cycle in connection with the ideas of Friedrich and August Schlegel.</p>
<p>[27] The conclusion is written in a rather unpolished manner, with the result 
  that the book feels somewhat &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps a deliberate strategy on 
  Ferris&rsquo;s part, in emulation of his conception of the Romantic cycle. Ferris 
  could have ended in a stronger manner by summarizing more clearly exactly how 
  his conception of the cycle grows out of Romantic aesthetics and criticism. 
  His main analytical concepts&mdash;open endings, weak beginnings, and song pairings&mdash;do 
  relate to Schlegel&rsquo;s ideas, or to those of nineteenth-century reviewers. Open 
  endings and weak beginnings result in forms that partake of the character of 
  the imperfect fragments to which Schlegel refers. The idea of song pairings 
  is hinted at in Oswald Lorenz&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;elective affinities&rdquo;; although Lorenz 
  never directly mentions song pairing, the term &ldquo;elective affinities&rdquo; (popularized 
  by Goethe&rsquo;s novella of that name) suggests a relation between two objects. The 
  notion that the cycle is not a unified whole, but itself a fragment is also 
  undoubtedly rooted in early nineteenth-century aesthetics. To this extent, then, 
  Ferris has fulfilled his aims; he has presented a conception of Romantic song 
  cycles that is based on Romantic ideology, and that is quite different from 
  the prevalent view of the organically unified cycle.</p>
<p>[28] In conclusion, I offer a number of broad reactions to Ferris&rsquo;s book. First, 
  it is not clear to me to which works Ferris intends his approach to apply. He 
  states in the first sentence of his book that he intends to do more than offer 
  an analysis of Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39; his book is to be about &ldquo;the genre of the 
  Romantic cycle in general&rdquo; (page 3). But what works are encompassed by the term 
  &ldquo;Romantic cycle&rdquo;? The answer that the book implies is the cycles that Schumann 
  wrote during the <i>Liederjahr,</i> for these are the only cycles that Ferris 
  addresses (outside of his references to nineteenth-century reviews of other 
  composers&rsquo; cycles). It would be interesting to learn whether there are any cycles 
  by other composers that exhibit the traits that Ferris mentions, and that could 
  fruitfully be analysed by his approach.</p>
<p>[29] Second, I find that Ferris has not made a sufficiently strong case for 
  pervasive compositional ideas and formal strategies as cohesive elements in 
  Schumann&rsquo;s op. 39. Although his examples of open endings, weak openings, and 
  recompositional pairings are most interesting, the importance of particular 
  ideas and strategies within a twelve-song cycle simply cannot be sufficiently 
  demonstrated by detailed musical analysis of only five of the songs. I believe 
  Ferris could have strengthened his arguments by at least brief analyses of additional 
  songs of the cycle. &ldquo;Zwielicht&rdquo;, for instance, which he analyses only textually, 
  is a prime example of the weak opening. The first two eighth notes (G and E) 
  suggest the tonic of E minor, but these notes are then absorbed into an arpeggiation 
  of a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> diminished triad, which resolves (as a skeletal subdominant with added 
  sixth) to a tenuous B minor triad. In measures 3&ndash;4, the material of the first two 
  measures is treated sequentially, leading to a similarly weak resolution to 
  A minor. Only then does Schumann turn more clearly toward E minor to bring in 
  the voice part. &ldquo;Zwielicht&rdquo; also illustrates the open ending. The first two 
  vocal strophes describe the same progression as the piano introduction (although, 
  unlike the introduction, they end by dwelling on the dominant of E minor). The 
  third and fourth strophes begin by intensifying the material of the first two; 
  the third does so by sequencing in an upward rather than a downward direction, 
  the fourth by thickening the texture. These intensifications, however, do not 
  lead, as one might expect, to climactic cadential arrivals; the rising sequence 
  of the first part of the third strophe (measures 24&ndash;27) is followed by a descending 
  line (measures 28&ndash;31), and the thick texture of the first part of the final strophe 
  dissipates at the very end of the song into an unsettling <i>recitativo secco</i> 
  texture. The eighth song, &ldquo;In der Fremde&rdquo;, which Ferris does not discuss at 
  all, is another instance of the weak opening. The initial twofold juxtaposition 
  of prolonged A minor and E minor harmonies (measures 1&ndash;5; measures 6&ndash;9) does not allow 
  the listener to identify a tonic; it is unclear whether the progression is i 
  to v in A minor, or iv to I in E minor. The former turns out to be the correct 
  interpretation, but clarification of the A minor tonic occurs only at the final 
  cadence of the song.</p>
<p>[30] If the evidence of the fragmentary nature of individual songs of op. 39 
  is solid&mdash;more so, indeed, than Ferris states, he may perhaps be overstating 
  the fragmentary character of op. 39 as a whole, and of Schumann&rsquo;s cycles in 
  general. Are the Eichendorff cycle and <i>Dichterliebe</i> really as open-ended 
  as Ferris would have it? As I mentioned, Ferris considers the last song of op. 
  39 (&ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht&rdquo;) as an example of an open ending, and feels that it 
  implies continuation rather than conclusion. I acknowledge that the poem does 
  not necessarily express the complete fulfillment that earlier writers have found 
  in it, and I admit that numerous inconclusive factors are present in the music 
  (pages 127&ndash;28). And yet the ending does not strike me as open. The final cadence, 
  notwithstanding the lack of a clear upper-voice <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> descent, sounds quite 
  strong. Cadences involving outer-voice <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> parallels are not uncommon, and 
  in a Schenkerian analysis of such a cadence, one could legitimately imply a 
  scale degree <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> over the dominant. Furthermore, performers who interpret the 
  ending in the traditional manner as suggesting closure and fulfillment&mdash;and 
  the performers I have heard all seem to do so!&mdash;can counteract the inconclusive 
  elements and can give the ending a sense of transcendent arrival, for example, 
  by emphasizing the <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>3</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>2</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span>&ndash;<span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>1</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> descent that occurs in the tenor range in measures 25&ndash;26, 
  by taking time at the vocal ending, and by pausing slightly before the first 
  E-natural in measure 26 so as to allow an &ldquo;unpolluted&rdquo; tonic to be heard at least 
  for a moment. </p>
<p>[31] It is not only because I hear the final song as more &ldquo;final&rdquo; than does 
  Ferris that I question the open-endedness of the cycle; it is also because Schumann 
  makes an effort to connect the final events of the cycle to those of the opening. 
  The return to the opening tonic at the end and, moreover, the palindromic key 
  structure of the first three and last three songs of the cycle, are significant 
  in this respect.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> 
  The fact that the final song is paired with the second one&mdash;a relationship that 
  Ferris himself has discovered&mdash;provides further evidence that Schumann wished 
  to tie the end of the cycle to its beginning to create a &ldquo;Lieder<i>kreis</i>&rdquo;&mdash;literally 
  a <i>circle</i> of songs. There is, furthermore, a relationship between the 
  final song and the last two songs of the first half (&ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne 
  Fremde&rdquo;); the first vocal phrase of all three songs consists of two segments 
  of a sequence&mdash;falling 6&ndash;5 segments in &ldquo;Mondnacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo;, 
  and rising 6&ndash;5 segments (the 5&rsquo;s concealed by covering tones) in &ldquo;Fr&uuml;hlingsnacht.&rdquo; 
  The fact that these relationships involve songs that are particularly significant 
  within the architecture of the cycle&mdash;the first two songs, the songs at the 
  end of the first half, and the final song&mdash;suggests that Schumann was especially 
  concerned that the beginning, middle, and end of the cycle be connected.</p>
<p>[32] Ferris similarly argues against closure at the end of <i>Dichterliebe,</i> 
  and again some of his arguments are convincing. The final poem is indeed not 
  as strongly closed as it may seem. As Ferris points out, the poet may wish to 
  bury his pain for once and for all in order to arrive at a resolution of his 
  unhappy love&mdash;but Heine&rsquo;s imagery suggests that it will be impossible for him 
  to do so; since there exists no coffin larger than the great cask of Heidelberg, 
  no bier longer than the Mainz bridge, and no giant pallbearers, the poet&rsquo;s immeasurable 
  pain must remain unburied. Ferris also does not accept the viewpoint of those 
  scholars who have argued that Schumann &ldquo;soften[s] or even contradict[s] the 
  tone of bitterness and renunciation in Heine&rsquo;s poem and<nobr> . . . </nobr>substitute[s] a sense 
  of forgiveness and reconciliation&rdquo;, thus providing &ldquo;the closure that Heine&rsquo;s 
  original cycle lacks&rdquo; (page 207). He interprets the final postlude not as a gesture 
  of closure, but as a &ldquo;wistful musical reminiscence&rdquo;, an &ldquo;afterthought or commentary&rdquo; 
  that confirms rather than contradicts the lack of psychological resolution (page 
  207). I find that the case for musical closure in <i>Dichterliebe</i> is actually 
  very strong. The return of the postlude from the twelfth song is a relatively 
  insignificant contributing factor to this sense of closure; whereas it suggests 
  reconciliation (because of the text that it immediately followed and on which 
  it commented in the twelfth song), this recapitulation of a passage from one 
  earlier song cannot, as Ferris (and Rosen) point out, provide closure.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> 
  Closure results, I believe, from a number of other factors. The metrical displacement 
  that becomes prominent toward the end of the cycle (particularly in songs 10, 
  11, 12, and 16) is twice resolved within the final song&mdash;at the end of the vocal 
  part (measures 43&ndash;52) and at the end of the postlude, where the material from song 
  12 (which features displacement) is followed by new metrically aligned material.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
  In addition, the final song alludes prominently to the first two songs of the 
  cycle, resulting in an effect of circularity even clearer than that in the Eichendorff 
  cycle. The extended <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> dominant seventh in measures 43&ndash;47 refers to the unresolved 
  final chord of the first song, and the passage in measures 48&ndash;49 to the end of the 
  second song (measures 12&ndash;14). The tonic triad of the final song also represents a 
  link to the first song; the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major triad is the unresolved final chord of 
  the first song with its dissonance removed&mdash;Schumann&rsquo;s way of suggesting that 
  the longing and desire expressed by the unresolved dominant seventh is not fulfilled, 
  but merely put aside. (Again, Schumann, unlike Heine, seems to have perceived 
  the final poem as a resolution, though not a happy one, of the poet&rsquo;s pain.) 
  The closure and circularity in these song cycles does not suggest the kind of 
  organic unity that Komar and other authors have sought, but it at least suggests 
  that Schumann thought of his cycles as wholes rather than as large-scale fragments.</p>
<p>[33] Ferris stresses at several points in his book that his ideas of the Romantic 
  cycle are &ldquo;no more prescriptive or authoritative&rdquo; than other models that have 
  been proposed, and hopes that his ideas will &ldquo;serve as a kind of corrective&rdquo; 
  to the organicist model (page 58). And whether or not readers agree with his views 
  in every respect, they will certainly find in Ferris&rsquo;s book a wealth of information 
  and insight to weigh against the conceptions of Schumann&rsquo;s cycles proposed by 
  earlier authors. They may decide, after doing so, that Ferris&rsquo;s views of the 
  Romantic cycle are more compelling than any that have yet been proposed, or 
  that the organic model is convincing after all, or that some new and different 
  model needs to be devised. The ultimate message with which Ferris leaves us 
  is that there is no single correct way to interpret the Romantic cycle, for 
  &ldquo;the significance and meaning of Schumann&rsquo;s songs continue to develop as successive 
  generations perform them, analyze them, and listen to them&rdquo; (page 227).</p>

  read the works of the Schlegels, but that he would have absorbed their philosophy 
  through Jean Paul and E. T. A. Hoffmann. Schumann&rsquo;s use of a quotation from 
  Friedrich Schlegel as a motto for his <i>Fantasy</i> op. 17 shows, however, 
  that he did have some familiarity with his writings. It is also known that Schumann 
  read essays by Friedrich Schlegel during meetings of the <i>Literarischer Verein</i> 
  to which he belonged between 1825 and 1828; see John Daverio, <i>Robert Schumann:

  as &ldquo;Ich will meine Seele tauschen&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tauchen.&rdquo; Note 93 in Chapter 
  3, a transcription of a review excerpt, contains numerous errors: &ldquo;in dies Bl&auml;ttern&rdquo;

  Ferris writes &ldquo;Walkdeinsamkeit&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Waldeinsamkeit.&rdquo; Within his transcription 
  of the last poem (page 129), he writes &ldquo;mit der Mondesglanz&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;mit dem 
  Mondesglanz.&rdquo; He consistently writes &ldquo;<i>Liederspielen</i>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;<i>Liederspiele</i>&rdquo;

  novella <i>Viel L&auml;rmen um nichts.</i><br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> Later on, Ferris refers to the setting of the last line 
  as a &ldquo;synecdochic return&rdquo; of the opening music, and states that the &ldquo;recapitulation 
  has been elided into the coda&rdquo; (page 106). These statements are more accurate 
  descriptions of the final section than the earlier argument that the form of 
  the song is ternary.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> Ferris finds the opening of &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; weak 
  also because of its tonal ambiguity; he states that &ldquo;we have no idea that B 
  major is the tonic until we get to the third strophe&rdquo; (page 164). I find that 
  Ferris exaggerates this tonal ambiguity. The sequential progression does render 
  the harmony unstable, but the tonality implied by the progression seems clear 
  to me; the prevalence of E-naturals from measure 2 onward makes it difficult to hear 
  any tonic but B major. When <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> is tonicized in measure 7, it sounds to me like a 
  dominant, not like a tonic. Ferris claims that the melody in measures 4&ndash;5 &ldquo;implies

  of these two songs, for example, Barbara Turchin in &ldquo;Robert Schumann&rsquo;s Song 
  Cycles,&rdquo; 320&ndash;21. Her (and other authors&rsquo;) conception of song pairing is, however, 
  different from Ferris&rsquo;s. Ferris&rsquo;s &ldquo;recompositional pairings&lrquo; are based upon 
  the use of analogous deep-level structures in two songs. The recognition of 
  such pairing does not depend on the order of the songs. The pairings that Turchin 
  discusses, or that David Neumeyer mentions in &ldquo;Organic Structure and the Song 
  Cycle,&rdquo; are based on foreground connections between adjacent songs rather than 
  on deeper-level similarities.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> This collection is held at the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek

  manuscripts of the songs may have existed, and that the Berlin drafts may therefore 
  not reflect the true order of composition. He also notes that there are inconsistencies

If one hears the F&#x266f; resolving to E in measure 12, there is little basis for Ferris&rsquo;s  hypermetrical analysis. Two-bar hypermeter falls nicely into place throughout the passage; measures 12&ndash;13 and 14&ndash;15 are parallel two-bar hypermeasures.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">Ferris states that there is no evidence that Schumann 
  read the works of the Schlegels, but that he would have absorbed their philosophy 
  through Jean Paul and E. T. A. Hoffmann. Schumann&rsquo;s use of a quotation from 
  Friedrich Schlegel as a motto for his <i>Fantasy</i> op. 17 shows, however, 
  that he did have some familiarity with his writings. It is also known that Schumann 
  read essays by Friedrich Schlegel during meetings of the <i>Literarischer Verein</i> 
  to which he belonged between 1825 and 1828; see John Daverio, <i>Robert Schumann: 
  Herald of a &ldquo;New Poetic Age&rdquo; </i>(New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 
  24.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">For example, in note 33 in Chapter 3, &ldquo;Adlersittige&rdquo; should 
  be &ldquo;Adlerfittige.&rdquo; On pages 86 and 92, Ferris refers to the fifth song of <i>Dichterliebe</i> 
  as &ldquo;Ich will meine Seele tauschen&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;tauchen.&rdquo; Note 93 in Chapter 
  3, a transcription of a review excerpt, contains numerous errors: &ldquo;in dies Bl&auml;ttern&rdquo; 
  instead of &ldquo;in diesen Bl&auml;ttern&rdquo;; &ldquo;der Anfant&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;der Anfang&rdquo;; 
  &ldquo;da&szlig; viele Leder dieses Cyklus wie Schmetterkinge . . . und us gar keine . . . &rdquo; 
  instead of &ldquo;da&szlig; viele Lieder dieses Cyklus wie Schmetterlinge . . . und uns 
  gar keine . . . .&rdquo; On page 97, within the second stanza of the first poem of op. 39, 
  Ferris writes &ldquo;Walkdeinsamkeit&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Waldeinsamkeit.&rdquo; Within his transcription 
  of the last poem (page 129), he writes &ldquo;mit der Mondesglanz&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;mit dem 
  Mondesglanz.&rdquo; He consistently writes &ldquo;<i>Liederspielen</i>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;<i>Liederspiele</i>&rdquo; 
  as the plural of <i>Liederspiel</i> (pages 200&ndash;01). In Chapter 8, note 12, a transcription 
  of a review from the <i>Neue Zeitschrift,</i> in the second paragraph, the word 
  &ldquo;zwischen&rdquo; is left out between &ldquo;schweben&rdquo; and &ldquo;beiden&rdquo;. In the third paragraph, 
  &ldquo;beegend&rdquo; should be &ldquo;beengend.&rdquo; In note 15 of the same chapter, l. 3, &ldquo;bedar&rdquo; 
  should be &ldquo;bedarf&rdquo;, and &ldquo;theatrlisch&rdquo; should be &ldquo;theatralisch.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">The original German of the passages in question is: &ldquo; . . . w&auml;hrend 
  im Formellen und durch wenige feine Z&uuml;ge kaum angedeutet ist, da&szlig; 
  die in diesem oder jenem Liede ausgesprochene Situation nicht ein isolirtes, 
  in sich abgerundetes Ganze, sondern das Glied einer Kette sei: . . . so durch . . . eine 
  nicht abschlie&szlig;ende harmonische Schlu&szlig;wendung, wie im zweiten, die 
  sich, das Lied als selbst&auml;ndiges genommen, wohl durch die Frage des ersten, 
  nicht aber f&uuml;r die &uuml;brigen rechtfertigen lie&szlig;e&ldquo; (quoted in note 
  77 on page 241).</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Schumann&rsquo;s metaphorical use of a term from the visual 
  arts, and specifically his implied preference for a sparse, economical texture, 
  recalls Schlegel's description of the Romantic artwork as a sketch or silhouette 
  (rather than a fully worked-out oil painting).</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">The original German of the sentence is: &ldquo;Hier handelt 
  es sich nicht um die Wiedergeburt der Poesie zum sch&ouml;neren, bl&uuml;henderen 
  Leben im Gesange, sondern der Tonsetzer hat die Worte mehr zu Dolmetschern seiner 
  musikalischen Sprache gemacht, deren Gel&auml;ufigkeit er f&uuml;r Beredsamkeit 
  h&auml;lt.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">The original German is: &ldquo;Er umh&uuml;llt die strahlenden 
  Blicke seines Geistes mit dem Nebel des Gleichmuths, gibt statt dichterischer 
  Gedanken poetische Floskeln.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">As Ferris points out, the narrator of &ldquo;In der Fremde&rdquo; 
  is, in Eichendorff&rsquo;s original poem, a woman&mdash;the female character Julie in the 
  novella <i>Viel L&auml;rmen um nichts.</i></div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Later on, Ferris refers to the setting of the last line 
  as a &ldquo;synecdochic return&rdquo; of the opening music, and states that the &ldquo;recapitulation 
  has been elided into the coda&rdquo; (page 106). These statements are more accurate 
  descriptions of the final section than the earlier argument that the form of 
  the song is ternary.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Ferris finds the opening of &ldquo;Sch&ouml;ne Fremde&rdquo; weak 
  also because of its tonal ambiguity; he states that &ldquo;we have no idea that B 
  major is the tonic until we get to the third strophe&rdquo; (page 164). I find that 
  Ferris exaggerates this tonal ambiguity. The sequential progression does render 
  the harmony unstable, but the tonality implied by the progression seems clear 
  to me; the prevalence of E-naturals from measure 2 onward makes it difficult to hear 
  any tonic but B major. When F&#x266f; is tonicized in measure 7, it sounds to me like a 
  dominant, not like a tonic. Ferris claims that the melody in measures 4&ndash;5 &ldquo;implies 
  a cadential close in F&#x266f; major&rdquo;, but the descent B&ndash;A&#x266f;&ndash;G&#x266f;&ndash;F&#x266f; can just as easily 
  imply 8&#710;&ndash;7&#710;&ndash;6&#710;&ndash;5&#710; in B (and does so, to my ears).</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">As Ferris admits, other authors have mentioned the pairing 
  of these two songs, for example, Barbara Turchin in &ldquo;Robert Schumann&rsquo;s Song 
  Cycles,&rdquo; 320&ndash;21. Her (and other authors&rsquo;) conception of song pairing is, however, 
  different from Ferris&rsquo;s. Ferris&rsquo;s &ldquo;recompositional pairings&lrquo; are based upon 
  the use of analogous deep-level structures in two songs. The recognition of 
  such pairing does not depend on the order of the songs. The pairings that Turchin 
  discusses, or that David Neumeyer mentions in &ldquo;Organic Structure and the Song 
  Cycle,&rdquo; are based on foreground connections between adjacent songs rather than 
  on deeper-level similarities.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">This collection is held at the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek 
  in Berlin. Ferris is more careful than earlier authors in his use of the &ldquo;Berlin 
  Notebooks&rdquo; as evidence of chronology. He takes into account that other, earlier 
  manuscripts of the songs may have existed, and that the Berlin drafts may therefore 
  not reflect the true order of composition. He also notes that there are inconsistencies 
  in the dating of the Berlin autographs, so that the dates cannot be fully trusted.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Here Ferris disagrees with McCreless, who, in &ldquo;Song 
  Order in the Song Cycle&rdquo; (18&ndash;21), takes the order of composition seriously as 
  a first version of op. 39.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Theodor Adorno, &ldquo;Zum Ged&auml;chtnis Eichendorffs,&rdquo;
