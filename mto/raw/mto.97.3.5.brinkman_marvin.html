in a new technology course are learning to experience and teach music in
a new way through the power of multimedia computing. Students learn to create
interactive multimedia applications on Macintosh computers that combine
color graphics, scanned images, video, sound files, MIDI synthesizer, music
notation, and tracks from commercial compact discs into a teaching environment
for their own students. This essay describes the syllabus, teaching methods,
and materials used in the course, and demonstrates sample student projects.</font></p>

<p><b>A Note About the Figures</b>

<p>[HyperCard was not designed for presentation on the Web, although facilities
for doing this easily are promised in the next major release. While there
are programs that convert HyperCard stacks for web use, many of the stacks
shown here utilize commercial or custom-made CDs and external commands for
the Macintosh, making them impractical for web presentation without a great
deal of rewriting. We have compromised by showing individual cards as GIF
images and portions of programs as QuickTime movies. This does not allow
user interaction, but does demonstrate the programs. The GIF images were
created from screen shots made via a keyboard shortcut on the Macintosh.
These were then cropped and converted with GIFConverter 2.3.7. QuickTime
movies were made using CameraMan 3.0 (Motion Works), which records movies
directly from the computer screen. CameraMan does not record the cursor
on PowerMacs, so wherever possible, we modified buttons and fields so that
they would be highlighted when the user clicks on them with the mouse. Many
of our stacks use a large-screen format which does not fit well into web
browsers. Movies of these were reduced to half size resulting in some loss
of definition, especially in text. Where higher definition was necessary,
we recorded partial windows, so the whole card does not show. We used SoundEdit
16, version 2 to reduce all sound tracks to 22.05 kHz, 8 bit, mono to keep
size to a minimum. Figures are shown in separate windows, which should be
closed after viewing each figure. We have provided a button, implemented
in JavaScript, at the bottom of each figure for this purpose, or you may
use the normal close box or pull-down menu, depending on which browser you
are using.</p>

<p>In the text-only version, figures that are text based are shown in full
through linked pages. When GIF images or QuickTime movies are involved,
we list the figure name below the paragraph in which it is mentioned and
give the name of the file (in case the reader is able to download and view
them). Where necessary, a short description of the picture or movie is included.
A prose description of multimedia is a poor substitute for the real thing;
PLEASE read this article online with a full graphic browser if at all possible.]<br>

<p><a NAME="anchor199837"></a>1. INTRODUCTION (<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>

<p>[1.1] In 1994 the authors were asked to design a new course in Multimedia
Programming to be offered by the Theory Department at the Eastman School
of Music. The course was to have two primary objectives&mdash;to acquaint students
with techniques for using multimedia computing in instructional settings,
and to develop techniques to be used in music-cognitive research. The course,
entitled &ldquo;Computing for Pedagogical and Cognitive Research Applications&rdquo;
was offered for the first time in the spring of 1995, and is now offered
each spring semester. We chose HyperCard as a programming environment because
the course was initially offered with minimal financial and technical support.
Although Macromedia Director was already becoming popular, it was expensive
and academic discounts were not available at the time. At about $85 per
copy, HyperCard could be put on each of the four computers we had available
for the course, and students could purchase it for use at home, thus extending
our minimal resources.</p>

<p>[1.2] The course, which is required for our MA Theory Pedagogy degree
and recommended for the Pedagogy and Cognition track in our Ph.D. program,
is available as an elective in other tracks in our Ph.D. program. It can
fulfill one theory requirement for graduate students in other degree programs
and can be taken for credit by upper-level undergraduate students with permission
of the instructors.</p>

<p>[1.3] This course complements several other courses offered at Eastman
that involve computers. The Theory Department also offers Brinkman&rsquo;s two-semester
programming course (Computer Applications in Music), and independent study
courses for students who want to do more in-depth work. Dave Headlam&rsquo;s courses
in acoustics, research methods, and web page design all have an important
computer component. The Composition Department offers several courses in
computer music synthesis, including an undergraduate introduction, and a
two-semester sequence for graduate students. The Music Education Department
offers their students training in use of synthesizers and MIDI, and Jazz
and Contemporary Media offers courses in film scoring, recording techniques,
and studio production techniques. As part of the Eastman Initiatives program,
many courses will be expanded to include a technology component. For example,
in the Theory Department we are moving toward putting many course materials
on the web, and we are planning a technology component in our undergraduate
core curriculum that will include the mandatory use of music notation software,
MIDI, CD-ROM browsing, and web usage.</p>

<p>[1.4] When we began the course, we did not have access to a well- equipped
computer lab. Sibley Music Library provided a room for teaching, and we
were able to borrow an overhead projector with a display device. The school
provided the teaching station, a Power Macintosh 6100 with MIDI keyboard
and interface, three computers for student use, and a limited budget for
purchasing software. We were fortunate that Sibley Library already had a
good selection of CD-ROM media applications, and was extremely helpful in
purchasing additional applications for their collection that would also
serve as good teaching examples. The library also made available space for
the student computers in their listening room for viewing applications and
preparing homework assignments.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor289222"></a>[1.5] During the one-semester course, students
review commercial software packages (both CD-ROMs and CAI packages for ear
training and theory instruction), design and run a music-cognitive experiment
that is completely implemented in HyperCard, and create an individual final
project in HyperCard. Final projects vary from music theory tutorials, to
ear training drill-and- practice, to repertoire-based CD &ldquo;companions.&rdquo;
Students are also required to complete smaller assignments to acquire HyperCard
authoring and scripting skills. The syllabus for the course for the Spring
1997 semester is shown in <b>Figure 1</b>.</p>

<p>[1.6] We have used several different texts in teaching the course in
addition to the manuals that come with HyperCard. We have found Beekman,
<i>HyperCard 2.3 in a Hurry</i> (<a href="#beekman_1996" id="citation_beekman_1996_67dc9bb2c3271">1996</a>) to be a terrific way to get students started
in multimedia quickly. The first year we had students buy <i>Desberg, HyperInterActive
CAI</i> (<a href="#desberg_1994" id="citation_desberg_1994_67dc9bb2c3275">1994</a>), which comes with a large set of example stacks. Although Desberg&rsquo;s 
treatment of educational philosophy and design were very helpful, the stacks
contain many errors and we often ended up using them as counter-examples
of good design. After the first year we put a copy of this text on reserve
in the library but did not have the students purchase it. Danny Goodman&rsquo;s
<i>The Complete HyperCard 2.2 Handbook</i> (<a href="#goodman_1993" id="citation_goodman_1993_67dc9bb2c3277">1993</a>) is the primary scripting source.
His practice of asking the reader to test commands interactively in HyperCard&rsquo;s
&ldquo;message box&rdquo; is an excellent pedagogical methodology, and his
approach to presenting HyperCard and HyperTalk is accessible and thorough.
Finally, <i>HyperTalk 2.2, The Book</i>, by Winkler, et. al. (<a href="#winkler_et_al_1994" id="citation_winkler_et_al_1994_67dc9bb2c3279">1994</a>) contains a
wealth of excellent examples illustrating HyperTalk programming techniques,
and was invaluable as a reference for the instructors. Students&rsquo; references
for the cognition portion of the course include David Butler, <i>The Musician&rsquo;s
Guide to Perception and Cognition</i> (<a href="#butler_1992" id="citation_butler_1992_67dc9bb2c327b">1992</a>), Ray and Ravizza, <i>Methods Toward
a Science of Behavior and Experience</i> (<a href="#ray_and_ravissa_1998" id="citation_ray_and_ravissa_1998_67dc9bb2c327d">1998</a>) and Cozby, <i>Methods in Behavioral
Research</i> (<a href="#cozby_1993" id="citation_cozby_1993_67dc9bb2c327f">1993</a>).</p>

<p>[1.7] HyperCard was the first generally available tool for developing
multimedia applications. Its design metaphor is a stack of cards, each of
which may contain text fields, buttons, pull-down menus, graphics, and so
on. Buttons, fields, portions of text, and even cards can be programmed
so that clicking on them with the computer&rsquo;s mouse causes some action to
occur&mdash;moving to a new card, playing music, viewing a movie, viewing hidden
text, etc. Stack design often provides for nonlinear access&mdash;that is, the
cards do not have to be accessed in a specific order. For example, clicking
on an item in a Table of Contents card can take the user directly to the
specified section of the stack; clicking on highlighted words (&ldquo;hot
text&rdquo;) might take the reader to a glossary with a definition of that
text or to another section of the stack that explains a related concept.
A diagram might be covered with invisible buttons, programmed so that clicking
on a specific location will transport the user to another card with related
information, graphics, or sound. Often, at least within sections, linear
navigation is also possible by clicking on buttons&mdash;typically right or left
arrows&mdash;to move to the next or previous card in the sequence. Thus both
linear and nonlinear learning styles can be accommodated within the same
stack. The integration of graphic representations, explanatory text, sound
files of musical excerpts or spoken narrative, and movies allow the learner
to explore a topic through many learning modalities.</p>

<p>[1.8] HyperCard has five user levels: Browsing, Typing, Painting, Authoring,
and Scripting. In the Browsing level, the user can explore (or navigate)
through stacks but cannot make any changes in them. The Typing level allows
the user to enter and edit text in fields. The next level allows users to
use Paint tools to change the appearance of cards and backgrounds. The Authoring
level allows users to add new cards, add buttons and fields and change their
appearance, link buttons to other cards, add transition effects, etc.&mdash;all
through the use of menus and mouse clicks. In this level, HyperCard automates
the creation of HyperTalk &ldquo;handlers&rdquo; that cause appropriate actions.
The Scripting level allows the user to program HyperCard in its native programming
language, HyperTalk.</p>

<p>[2.1] While planning the course, we decided to use multimedia techniques
in our teaching wherever possible, and devised a pedagogical method we call
&ldquo;Using the Tools to Teach the Tools.&rdquo; This had several advantages
in a course such as this: 1) it provided immediate examples of the utility
of the methods we were teaching; 2) it facilitated the instructors&rsquo; rapid
development of skills with the programming techniques they would be teaching;
3) the programs developed would serve as study examples later in the course
when they were learning to program in HyperTalk.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor311887"></a>[2.2] The first of our &ldquo;teaching tools&rdquo;
was a HyperCard stack we called a &ldquo;bullet template.&rdquo; It was motivated
by the authors&rsquo; aversion to lectures in which the presenters put up transparencies
covered with paper so the audience can see only the point currently being
discussed. Instead, our stack uses bullet paragraphs with &ldquo;fields&rdquo;
for adding text. The presenter alternately shows or hides the text by clicking
on the bullet, and can move drag bullets to different positions for page
formatting. Menu items are provided for hiding or showing all of the text
on a card and for aligning the text. A button on the bottom of the page
unlocks and locks the text fields so that they can be modified. Scripted
buttons can be added to the card for going to other cards or other HyperCard
applications, or scripts can be added to the fields, so that clicking on
the text causes some action to be taken. <b>Figure 2</b> is an example of a class
presentation on HyperCard&rsquo;s internal sounds. We have used this device for
preparing many class lectures, and in a larger format, with color added,
to do presentations at conferences. <b>Figure 3</b> is a portion of the stack we
used for our presentation at the 1996 SMT Conference. Many buttons in this
stack are linked to other stacks, so the whole presentation can be made
from one program. (Here, the QuickTime movie is reduced to half size to
fit in web browsers.) Our lecture notes are provided in this format for
our students on each of the lab computers, and more advanced students can
study the programming used to implement the stack as well. Other examples
of our pedagogical tools&mdash;an online journal and computer-implemented music
cognition experiments&mdash;are discussed below.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor232005"></a>3. SOFTWARE REVIEW&mdash;AN ONLINE JOURNAL (<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>

<p>[3.1] A review of commercial instructional products serves two pedagogical
purposes. First, it familiarizes students with the applications that are
available, which will serve them well in future teaching positions. Second,
students are encouraged to make notes on features they like, don&rsquo;t like,
or could be improved upon. This suggests techniques they might implement
in their own final projects.</p>


<p><a NAME="anchor386879"></a>[3.2] In keeping with &ldquo;teaching tools&rdquo;
philosophy, we designed an Online Journal for the students&rsquo; use. The first
time we taught the course we developed criteria for software evaluation
in class discussion after reading Desberg&rsquo;s chapters on software design
and evaluation. The outline designed by the class is shown in <b>Figure
4</b>. Using this as a starting point, Brinkman wrote a HyperCard Stack
for use in the review process. The journal template consists of a blank
title card, one card for a review, and a help card. New review cards are
added by the student as needed. Each review card has fields for the title,
reviewer, date, and author, and radio buttons for indicating the software
type (Tutorial, Drill and Practice, Game, or Simulation). In addition, students
click on buttons to specify an overall rating of the program (1 to 5 in
increments of .5). Buttons are provided for accessing text fields for describing
Publication Information, System Requirements, Overview, Visual Style, Navigation,
Instructions, General Discussion, Content, and Other). Clicking on each
button causes a pop-up field to cover the card, with the button name as
a title bar. Scrolling fields are used so that as much information as needed
can be entered. The student can see an outline of what should be included
in the field by shift-clicking on the title bar. A pull-down menu allows
the user to print a single entry or the whole journal, or to save entries
as a text file that can be imported into other word processing programs.
Students are encouraged to do a thorough and thoughtful review of each of
their chosen software packages&mdash;not simply to report what is there but to
evaluate the content and its utility for various audiences, the implementation,
and user interface. Students can have the journal stack open at the same
time as the applications they are reviewing, so they can flip back and forth.
An example of this stack, by Tom Toner (a D.M.A. percussion student), is
shown in <b>Figure 5</b>. The first year, we had students review five products,
but subsequent years we cut back to three to allow additional time for development
of their final projects. Each student is also required to do a one-page
summary of one or two programs to share with the class.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor232363"></a>4. GETTING STARTED (<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>

<p>[4.1] Each year, we begin the class by showing some of the best final
projects from previous classes. <b>Figure 6</b> shows the opening sequence from
one such project by Jon Hynes, a D.M.A. piano student. (Others are shown
in section 8 of this essay.) This demonstration gives the students a good
idea of where the course is headed and helps to set high expectations for
their own final projects. Although we have had some excellent projects from
each class, this practice (along with our increasing experience in teaching
the material) has helped to raise the overall quality of final projects
each year we have taught the course. Next we introduce students to <i>HyperCard
in a Hurry</i> (Beekman), which is designed as seven &ldquo;sessions&rdquo;
that progress logically through HyperCard&rsquo;s user levels, from Browsing through
simple Scripting. The last unit introduces color tools (which were not available
in early versions of HyperCard) and discusses various &ldquo;external commands&rdquo;
for controlling external devices, synthesizing speech, and controlling QuickTime
movies. Recently we have introduced color tools much earlier in the course
rather than waiting or Beekman&rsquo;s final session. </p>

<p>[4.2] Each of Beekman&rsquo;s units leads students through detailed steps to
create a working HyperCard stack. This learn-by-doing pedagogy provides
an effective and fast introduction. From the start, we supplement these
exercises with readings in Goodman for more detailed information, and often
have the students do a second version of the assignment that is much more
complete and adds various &ldquo;bells and whistles,&rdquo; or that makes
the project more meaningful. For example, Session 2 &ldquo;The Dynamic File
Cabinet: Information Storage and Retrieval,&rdquo; teaches students to use
an &ldquo;Address Book&rdquo; stack that comes with HyperCard, and then teaches
the reader how to increase the user level, get into the &ldquo;background&rdquo;
of a card, delete or copy fields and buttons, and add labels to fields.
We supplement this lesson by giving detailed instructions for modifying
the stack to make a custom &ldquo;Discography&rdquo; for cataloguing their
recordings. This new version of the stack requires the students to change
field names, add new fields and buttons, and write a simple button script.</p>

<p>[4.3] Beekman&rsquo;s Session 3 teaches the Authoring level of HyperCard and
Paint tools, through the creation of a stack that illustrates an Egyptian
pyramid, with buttons that allow the user to &ldquo;enter&rdquo; one of the
chambers and then to return to the diagram of the pyramid. We teach the
students how to add &ldquo;clip art&rdquo; and how to add scripts to play
music using HyperCard&rsquo;s built-in sounds. Students then create a second version
of the Pyramid stack that is more ornate, illustrates each room of the pyramid,
and adds traveling music while changing cards. <b>Figure 7</b> shows the version
created following Beekman&rsquo;s instructions. <b>Figure 8</b> is the much more creative
version done by Kristin Tait, a D.M.A. percussion student, who provided
for direct navigation between the pyramid &ldquo;map&rdquo; and individual
rooms or for a &ldquo;tour&rdquo; of the pyramid via clicking on an asp to
move from room to room. Tait also made good use of perspective in designing
the various rooms. Beekman&rsquo;s instructions result in nearly identical student
stacks, while our modified assignments provide a vehicle for student individuality
and creativity. We always have a stimulating class session showing different
versions of these assignments; the presentation also provides an opportunity
to critique design decisions made by the students. In general, we require
students to do the basic assignment as an ungraded exercise, and then collect
and grade the extended creative version.</p>

<p>[5.1] While users can create useful and even impressive stacks without
ever doing any programming, learning the scripting language behind HyperCard
empowers them to do many things that would otherwise be impossible, such
as storing information about students and their progress (in CAI), controlling
external devices using external commands, and creating applications that
would be impossible without the finer level of control that scripting provides.
Finding the correct balance is difficult, because some of the students in
our multimedia class have already taken Brinkman&rsquo;s two-semester programming
course, some are experienced programmers, and some have never used a computer
for anything more demanding than word processing. We begin laying the groundwork
early&mdash;during the first or second class&mdash;by teaching students how to &ldquo;peek&rdquo;
at the scripts in buttons to see how the task is actually done, and to introduce
the elemental concepts of object oriented programming. For example, after
they have used the automated tools to link a button to a card, we encourage
them to look at the &ldquo;handler&rdquo; (procedure) in the button script,
something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><font SIZE="-1">       on mouseUp</font>
<font SIZE="-1">         go to card id 1045</font>
<font SIZE="-1">       end mouseUp</font></pre>
</blockquote>



<p>Even at this early stage, we explain that clicking the mouse sends a
&ldquo;mouseDown&rdquo; message through the system; releasing the mouse sends
a &ldquo;mouseUp&rdquo; message, which causes the on-screen button to perform
the action: go to the specified card.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor439668"></a>[5.2] We introduce other messages and discuss
message passing hierarchies (precedence) and more arcane topics a bit later.
Generally we introduce new concepts with a &ldquo;bullet lecture&rdquo; and
give related reading assignments in Goodman, provide a handout summarizing
the techniques, and do in-class demonstrations by typing commands into the
message box or writing handlers to illustrate techniques. If we have prepared
a longer demonstration, the stacks are left on computers where the students
can study them. We also discuss the scripts in class and give students a
paper copy that they can study at home. We have designed a series of &ldquo;scripting&rdquo;
assignments that teach the basics of programming to the novice, but encourage
more advanced students to extend the exercises. As a first scripting exercise,
we discuss button and field properties. Students are already familiar with
some of these from setting them with menus. We provide a handout listing
all of the properties of buttons and fields, explain how to set these properties
in HyperTalk, do some in-class illustration and experimentation, and then
give them an assignment which forces them to master the concepts. <b>Figure 9</b> 
is a listing of the
first assignment; <b>Figure 10</b> shows a solution by Jocelyn Neal (a Ph.D. theory
student). This student&rsquo;s solution features music-related quotes from Hugo, Wagner,
Stravinsky, Congreve, Heine, and Thoreau. Clicking on the author&rsquo;s name
highlights the appropriate text, and other buttons display the sources and
dates. The stack also makes good use of Art Deco borders provided as resources
by HyperCard.

<p><a NAME="anchor511997"></a>[5.3] After teaching control structures (if
.. then .. else) and various forms of loops (repeat until, repeat with,
repeat while, etc.), we give another assignment in which students use simple
arithmetic and control structures to move buttons from one place on the
screen to another. <b>Figure
11</b> shows the assignment; <b>Figure 12</b> again shows a student solution.</p>


<p>[5.4] Some students, especially those with no programming background,
find these assignments difficult and need some assistance to complete them,
but most become fairly comfortable with writing or modifying handlers by
the end of the course, and some of the more experienced students do some
remarkable programming for their final projects.</p>

<p>[5.5] A later scripting assignment deals with using the clickLine, a
HyperTalk function that identifies the line number and field name of the
last field the user clicks on. Once students have learned how to write handlers
and use some external commands, this function can be used in many different
ways, e.g., building a table of contents linked to other cards, or building
a form chart that plays the appropriate passage from a CD when the user
clicks on a form label. These techniques are demonstrated in Section 8 in
many of the final projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor234350"></a>6. USING EXTERNAL COMMANDS (<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>


<p>[6.1] Many extensions to HyperCard are available in the form of external
commands&mdash;utility programs written in high-level programming languages such
as C or C++. These commands can be called from HyperCard to control devices
such as MIDI synthesizers and CD players. We incorporate several of these
in our course. Voyager&rsquo;s CD Audio Toolkit provides tools for indexing and
accessing music on compact disks. We introduce this early in the course
during our unit on music cognition and perception. After reading several
chapters in David Butler&rsquo;s <i>The Musician&rsquo;s Guide to Perception and Cognition,</i>
the students are given an introduction to the Voyager toolkit, and use it
to make buttons that play musical examples from Butler&rsquo;s CD. In a follow-up
assignment, they import music notation for the examples, and design a stack
that displays the examples with explanation, and plays the musical excerpts
from the CD. This exercise provides practice in presenting material in a
multimedia format, as well as in using the Voyager tools and a music notation
package. A solution by Jeff Markarian, a Ph.D. theory student, is shown
in <b>Figure 13</b>.</p>

<p>[6.2] The Voyager toolkit is also invaluable for its many examples of
scripts for doing different types of tasks with music CDs, written using
their external commands. As a simple example, the command &ldquo;CDPlay 00,01,15,02,22,45&rdquo;
plays a segment of a compact disk in the computer&rsquo;s CD drive. The command
specifies the starting time and ending time of the segment in minutes, seconds,
and frames (75 per second), measured from the beginning of the CD. Commands
like this can be placed in scripts in buttons, fields, backgrounds, and
cards to control the CD player. Later in the course, after students have
had more HyperTalk programming experience, we study some of the more elaborate
scripts, such as those that link a succession of cards to a CD passage or
that highlight measures in music notation as a CD passage plays. We provide
handouts with details of the Voyager external commands and functions with
examples of their use; many students use these tools in their final projects.</p>

<p>[6.3] We also introduce and demonstrate other external commands. Although
time has not permitted formal assignments using these, demonstration stacks
and manuals are available, and we help students to use them in their final
projects if they are needed. We have used two packages for controlling MIDI&mdash;Opcode&rsquo;s
MIDIplay, and Earlevel&rsquo;s HyperMidi. Midiplay is no longer actively supported,
but it is available from Opcode&rsquo;s educational contact, and we have used
it in implementing cognition experiments (see below). One of our previous
students, John Clevenger (a Ph.D. theory student), is using HyperMidi with
HyperCard to develop an ear-training package that is quite impressive.</p>

<p>[6.4] We also introduce QuickTime movies through Apple&rsquo;s QuickTime Tools,
distributed with HyperCard. These powerful tools make it easy to add movies
to stacks, but are also useful for playing MIDI files and sound files. One
can either display a QuickTime controller on a card or, using the Advanced
Tools and some scripting, control the files from scripts without showing
the controller.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor234716"></a>7. IMPLEMENTING MUSIC-COGNITION EXPERIMENTS
(<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>

<p>[7.1] Each time we have taught the course, we have included a cognition
experiment as part of the course design. We introduce the cognition component
early through readings in Butler and the Voyager CD Audio Toolkit assignment.
Later we teach a unit on experimental design, including readings carefully
chosen by Marvin to lay the groundwork for our experiment. Then, as a class
project, we design, implement, and carry out an experiment. Marvin proposes
the topic, which is refined and developed through class discussion, and
students help to locate and prepare appropriate musical stimuli. Then, while
students are working on their final projects, Brinkman works on his: implementing
the experiment in HyperCard. Students in the class recruit friends and classmates
to participate as subjects and help to administer the experiment by overseeing
participant sessions. (With a student body of roughly 800 undergraduate
and graduate students, Eastman is a wonderful place for finding participants.)
Students in the course are given an introduction to APA (American Psychological
Association) style and each write the first part of a paper on the experiment,
describing the hypothesis and method, but omitting the section on results
and analysis. The instructors do a preliminary analysis of the data using
Statview; we present preliminary findings to the class late in the semester.
After the term is over, we do a more leisurely and thorough analysis of
the data to prepare papers for eventual conference presentation and publication,
with due credit given to our students who participated in running the experiment.</p>

<p>[7.2] There are many advantages to the computer implementation. If the
program is designed well, the subjects can participate with little outside
intervention, although we always have a class member or instructor available
to answer questions if necessary. The computer is used for all aspects of
the experiment&mdash;it gives instructions, collects data on the participants,
presents practice problems, administers a pretest, presents the stimuli,
and collects data on responses. Our programs randomly generate a different
stimulus order for each subject, eliminating learning effects as a &ldquo;confound.&rdquo;
HyperCard can measure subjects&rsquo; response times to a 60th of a second without
adding any extra data- collection hardware. All data are saved to the hard
disk in text files as comma-separated lists that import easily into Excel
and Statview. The greatest advantage of the computer implementation is the
amount of information, both about the subjects and about the stimuli, that
we can embed in these files. We can massage the data in many ways, and perform
statistical analysis of the interaction between many different factors,
and we avoid the drudgery and chance of introducing errors associated with
manual transcription of subject responses.</p>

<p>[7.3] We have implemented three experiments to date, one having to do
with differences in tonic perception by absolute-pitch (AP) and relative-pitch
(RP) listeners, and two on perception of tonal closure by trained musicians.
Space does not permit a detailed discussion of our hypotheses and results&mdash;these
will be published elsewhere. Here, we will concentrate on the computer implementation.</p>


<p>[7.4] In the first part of an experiment session, we collect data about
the subjects, their age, sex, primary instrument, academic discipline, number
of years of training, etc. Although some questions vary from experiment
to experiment, the method of collecting the data is similar, using a combination
of check boxes and dialog boxes. Before going on, the participant is shown
a summary of the data. Clicking on any item with the mouse allows the subject
to go back and change an answer. This portion of an experiment is shown
in <b>Figure 14</b>.</p>


<p>[7.5] Each of our experiments to date has included a &ldquo;pretest&rdquo;
to see to what degree the subject possesses &ldquo;absolute pitch&rdquo; (AP).
In the first experiment, we used both AP and RP subjects, and needed to
track response times for each stimulus. We designed an interface with note
names arranged in a circle around a central &ldquo;Play&rdquo; button, so
that each response would be equidistant from &ldquo;Play.&rdquo; The subject
clicks on &ldquo;Play,&rdquo; listens to the stimulus, and then clicks on
one of buttons to identify the pitch (or tonic, in the actual experiment).
Subjects could change their answers by clicking on different buttons. When
they click on central button, which has changed to &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; their
answers are recorded. We trained subjects to use the interface through a
practice round in which the user clicked on buttons that were randomly selected
by the computer until they could perform the task consistently in under
a second. In a second practice round, pitches were played and the subjects
selected the notes they thought they heard. The actual pretest followed
the same format, except that many more pitches were given (in random order).
The computer recorded the actual note played, the subject&rsquo;s answer, time
from stimulus to answer, and whether the answer was correct or incorrect,
along with the subjects ID number and other pertinent information. This
portion of the experiment is shown in <b>Figure 15</b>.</p>

<p>[7.6] In the second part of this experiment, subjects used the same interface
to identify the perceived tonic in excerpts chosen from piano and chamber
music literature. (This is not shown because the interface is the same.)
In this portion of the experiment, subjects who had identified themselves
as having RP were given a reference tone before each excerpt was played.</p>

<p>[7.7] Because we were not concerned about timing information in the next
two experiments, we redesigned the interface for the pretest as an on-screen
keyboard. The participant identified pitches by clicking on the keyboard.
A button above the keyboard changed appropriately from &ldquo;Play&rdquo;
to &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; and a field above gave instructions. This interface
is shown in <b>Figure 16</b>.</p>

<p>[7.8] Our experiments on tonal closure used recorded excerpts or short
movements as stimuli. After each excerpt was played, the subject was asked
to answer questions by clicking on check boxes on an answer form. In keeping
with accepted methodology, the experimental questions were intermingled
with other questions to conceal the hypothesis from the participants. The
answer form for our latest experiment is shown in <b>Figure 17</b>. The participants
were required to answer all questions.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor589144"></a>[7.9] We have used a variety of methods for
presenting stimuli. The first two years we used a MIDI synthesizer controlled
directly by MIDIplay to present the single-pitch stimuli and sequences of
interference tones between trials. This was facilitated through MIDIplay&rsquo;s
&ldquo;xmit&rdquo; command, which makes it possible to send MIDI control signals
to the synthesizer directly. (See <b>Figure
18</b> for a simple example.) In our first experiment, we made digital recordings
of the musical excerpts and played them as resources in stacks. By our second
experiment, we had obtained a CD recorder, so we made a custom CD with each
stimulus on a separate track. Individual tracks were easy to access through
a simple Voyager commands, e.g., &ldquo;CDplay1 5&rdquo; to play the fifth
track on the CD. In our third experiment, we used a CD to present all stimuli,
including the pieces, isolated tones for the AP pretest, and multiple sequences
of interference tones. Those that were produced by a synthesizer were recorded
digitally directly from a Kurzweil PC 88 MX synthesizer, using SoundEdit
16. Thus, we did not have to deal with the idiosyncrasies of MIDI setup,
and could run several subjects at a time on different computers, each with
a separate copy of the CD.</p>

<p>[7.10] There is a great deal of programming behind these experiments.
We spend some class time discussing problems and their solutions and demonstrating
programming techniques, and feedback from the class is often helpful in
refining the interface and presentation. Although details of the programming
are beyond students without previous programming experience, all can benefit
from a general knowledge of the problems that need to be overcome, and a
print-out of all of the scripts used to implement the experiment is made
available for any students who wish to study them.</p>

<p>[8.1] Each student is required to do a final project, which is the culmination
of the semester&rsquo;s work, and gives the students an opportunity to tie together
many facets of the course. Students submit a proposed topic and rudimentary
outline by about the middle of the semester, and in the last half of the
course we minimize daily assignments so they can concentrate on this major
undertaking. Our general guidelines for the student projects are shown in <b>Figure 19</b>. 
We make individual
appointments with the students to review their progress, to give guidance
and assistance when necessary, and to help solve programming problems in
projects that require a scripting.</p>

<p>[8.2] Projects may be literature-based or tutorial, and may be designed
for different audiences. Most of our students present college-level material,
but a few have designed programs for younger children. Since projects are
intended for in-class use only, we allow students to use commercial recordings
and to scan art work from published sources, but warn them that if they
ever want to seek publication or distribute their stacks to others, they
will have to obtain permission from the copyright holders. We also insist
on high standards of academic integrity&mdash;when material is used that is not
their own, sources must be acknowledged.</p>

<p>[8.3] We conclude with samples of students&rsquo; final projects from our course.
Space, downloading time, and copyright restrictions prohibit us from showing
complete projects in this medium. We hope that the excerpts shown here will
be sufficient to demonstrate the kinds of things our students are doing
and the quality of their work. Most students designed projects that reflect
their interests and major area of study.</p>

<p>[8.4] Many of the projects, particularly those by performance majors,
are literature-based. One example is a stack by Bret Dorhout, a D.M.A. student
in organ performance, which presents information about Bach&rsquo;s Cantata 93,
&ldquo;Wer nun den lieben Gott laesst Walten.&rdquo; <b>Figure 20</b> shows his title
page and table of contents, which is linked to the various sections of the
stack. Each card of the stack has the CD controls shown here; clicking on
the picture of Bach in the lower right-hand corner returns the user to the
table of contents. This student completed two major portions of the stack.
<b>Figure 21</b> shows part of the Text Translation section. Clicking on a line
of text highlights the line and plays the musical setting. As the music
continues, the highlight follows the text, and cards flip to the next section
when necessary. Listening can be nonlinear&mdash;the user can click on any line,
in German or English, to hear the setting of that text, or can listen to
a whole section, or even the whole cantata straight through. Dorhout also
implemented a View the Score section, a small portion of which is shown
in <b>Figure 22</b>. The reduced score was created in Finale and copied into the
stack. Then a transparent button was placed over each measure and, following
an example from the Voyager CD Audio Toolkit, the stack was programmed so
that clicking on any measure would play it, while &ldquo;button effects&rdquo;
would show the listener which measure was playing. Dorhout enabled and disabled
the buttons in sequence (disabling causes the them to turn gray and partially
mask the music). He discovered that this results in a more aesthetically
pleasing animation than the more common highlighting technique, which causes
a white foreground on a black background. Again, the user can listen to
the music continuously or jump around at will, and cards change automatically
at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>[8.5] Tom Toner, a D.M.A. percussion student, did his project on John
Cage&rsquo;s Third Construction. After an extended animated introduction (not
shown due to downloading time), the table of contents appears. Toner used
a Voyager technique&mdash;linking cards to the CD&mdash;to describe the percussion
instruments and techniques heard as the piece plays, as shown in <b>Figure
23</b>. He also implemented a reference section on the percussion instruments
used, with accompanying text, pictures, and sounds. Clicking on the pictures
plays a recording of the instruments, which he played himself and recorded
in his studio, then digitized for use in his project. The user can also
hear an excerpt from Third Construction that shows the instrument in the
context of the piece. (See <b>Figure 24</b>.)</p>

<p>[8.6] Kurt Fowler, a D.M.A. student in cello performance, did a project
on Bach Cello Suites. He was particularly interested in performance issues&mdash;contrasting
editions and different bowing solutions. His attractive black and white
stack is an excellent example of multilevel design. Since reduced-sized
movies of this stack were not effective, we will show some highlights with
screen shots. When the stack opens, a recording of a Bach Cello suite plays
automatically as the title card appears on screen. Clicking on the title
page takes the user to the main menu or table of contents. The design is
consistent and very clean, with few visible buttons for navigation. The
user moves to other sections or submenus by clicking on lines in the table
of contents, and returns by clicking on pictures, which appear to be scanned
images of wood-cut impressions. <b>Figure 25</b> shows the title page and several
of the submenus. Not all sections were completed during the course, but
those that were are impressive and innovative. <b>Figure 26</b> shows the first
page of his &ldquo;Bowing Solutions&rdquo; section. The user can page through
the movement one measure at a time or jump to any specified measure, and
see scanned images of the measure from six different historical and modern
editions. Clicking on the graphics brings up a full page of music from the
selected edition so the measure can be seen in context. The user can compare
three different performances by selecting a check box for Pablo Casals,
Janos Starker, or Anner Bylsma and then clicking on Play This Measure. (Figure
26 also has QuickTime movies of the sound files for this measure.) We were
able to accomplish this without swapping CDs by combining tracks from several
commercial recordings on one custom-made CD, which was accessed using Voyager
CD Audio Tool Kit. Fowler also implemented one movement of &ldquo;View the
Score&rdquo; in a similar manner, with animated measure highlighting, check
boxes to select the desired performance, and buttons to take the user to
a scanned image of each different edition.</p>

<p>[8.7] We saw the opening of Jon Hynes&rsquo;s project earlier in Figure 6.
Hynes is a D.M.A. student in piano performance who plans to use this program
in his private teaching studio after he finishes his degree. His students
will be able to use the program to learn more about the piano, music history,
composers, and piano literature, etc., while waiting for their lessons.
Although the original program was in small-screen format and black and white,
he has since redesigned it for a larger computer screen and added color,
including many scanned images of instruments and composers. His main table
of contents and some of the submenus are shown in <b>Figure 27</b>. In the sections
on composers and instruments, clicking on the reduced picture next to the
text takes the user to another card with a large full-color picture, so
more detail can be seen. Last summer (1997), in an independent study class
with Brinkman, he began work on the music reading and theory rudiments sections.
He has designed an attractive on- screen keyboard, which can be modified
through changing button, card, and background scripts to serve in many different
capacities. In <b>Figure 28</b>, it is used for beginners to practice identifying
notes, which appear in a field on the screen in random order. Students hear
the notes when they click on the screen. They are given immediate feedback,
and questions they miss are placed in a queue for later review. Students
specify the clefs they want to practice, and the program records the students&rsquo;
names, exercises performed, and scores in external files so the teacher
can track their progress.</p>

<p>[8.8] Allison Weitzman, an undergraduate theory major, was taking courses
in jazz theory and improvisation when she took our class, and designed a
program for practicing jazz ear training. Her project, which is remarkably
complete, used a custom-made CD for recorded examples and MIDIplay to control
a synthesizer. Her program uses an attractive design with a scanned score
on the title page. The menu is hidden, but programmed so that items appear
when the mouse passes over them, and clicking on a menu item takes the user
to the appropriate section. Music plays whenever the user returns to the
title page (table of contents). Sections for practicing intervals, scales,
modes, chords, and harmonic progression are implemented. The interface is
shown in <b>Figure 29</b> (we won&rsquo;t take time to answer the questions). Users can
customize each section by checking boxes to specify exactly what they want
to practice. The Harmony section is most impressive. The user clicks on
a button to hear a recording of one of the jazz greats playing a piece,
then listens to a harmonic reduction of the chord progression synthesized
on the MIDI keyboard. The object is to enter the correct chord symbols.
The user selects answers from the bottom of the page, and then enters them
by clicking on fields below the score. Clicking on any measure starts playing
the MIDI file at that point. After the exercise is completed, it is graded
and the user is given feedback. An example of this interface is shown in
<b>Figure 30</b>.</p>

<p>[8.9] Jeff Campbell, a jazz bass player who was recently hired on the
Jazz and Contemporary Media faculty at Eastman, did another jazz project
for our course. His stack is an excellent tutorial on jazz bass, which explains
many of his improvisation concepts with musical examples in notation that
can be heard on a CD that he recorded himself for the project. A few frames
from his stack are shown in <b>Figure 31</b>.</p>


<p>[8.10] Several projects have used multimedia techniques to good advantage
for illustrating music-theoretical concepts. Valerie Errante, a D.M.A. voice
student, did her project on Schubert&rsquo;s Erlkoenig. In her discussion of musical
structure, she modified Voyager&rsquo;s measure-highlighting technique by placing
buttons linked to the CD over a diagram of the song (from Brinkman&rsquo;s class
notes for sophomore theory). While listening to the song, the user can follow
the tonal motion in a bass reduction as highlighted buttons show the location
in the form diagram. Alternately, the user can click the mouse on any section
to hear it. This is especially useful for comparing sections or for discussing
Schubert&rsquo;s musical characterization of the four cast members (narrator,
father, son, and king). In <b>Figure 32</b> we contrast the three statements of
the refrain, &ldquo;Mein Vater, mein Vater,&rdquo; sung by the son. Errante
also included a more detailed discussion of the formal structure&mdash;shown
in <b>Figure 33</b> without sound to save downloading time.</p>

<p>[8.11] A project on Schubert&rsquo;s Nacht und Traeume by Jocelyn Neal, a Ph.D.
theory student, also contains a good deal of analytic information. <b>Figure
34</b> shows her animated demonstration of a common-tone modulation. In another
section, she linked Carl Schachter&rsquo;s analytic reduction of the song to the
CD. While the song plays, an arrow moves across the screen to make a direct
visual connection between the recording and the graph. Another button produces
more information about the graph. (See <b>Figure 35</b>.)</p>

<p>[8.12] Stefanie Crumbley, a Ph.D. theory student, did a project related
to her teaching in our Freshman theory course. Her work was based on drills
that Neil Minturn, our Freshman theory coordinator at the time, called &ldquo;Speedwork.&rdquo;
In these exercises, students learned basic patterns in tonal music, e.g.,
tonic expansions through arpeggiation or use of passing chords, and were
required to recognize them and apply them in practical situations quickly
and fluently, i.e., to assimilate them and make them part of their musical
&ldquo;vocabulary.&rdquo; Crumbley&rsquo;s project showed many of these patterns
in reduction with MIDI realizations, quizzed the students in their usage,
and illustrated them in excerpts from Haydn symphonies. <b>Figure 36</b> shows
an animation used by Crumbley to demonstrate how these basic patterns can
be combined into a larger context. The year after completing our course,
Crumbley&mdash;who was by then teaching the third year of our undergraduate theory
sequence&mdash;used HyperCard to write an excellent tutorial on atonal theory
that was used in the course.</p>


<p>[8.13] We will show one stack from the abbreviated summer course we taught
last July. For the Summer Session course, we provided a set of template
stacks so that students could get a quick start in the one-week intensive
program. Daphne Leong, a Ph.D. student in our theory program, did a tutorial
on Bartok&rsquo;s String Quartet No. 5. The opening sequence of her stack is shown
as <b>Figure 37</b>. For visual unity she used a scanned image of a Kandinsky painting

as backgrounds in other sections of her project. <b>Figure 38</b> shows screen
shots of sections from her stack. In the form section, the items in the
form chart are linked to a commercial CD so that clicking on an item plays
that section of the piece. In the Listening section, she placed scanned
images of the score on cards, which also contained a description of the
action and a form diagram. The cards change in synchrony with the music,
and the highlighted button on form chart moves to show which section is
playing.</p>

<p>[8.15] In <b>Figure 39</b> we show an animation designed by John Clevenger for
humorous feedback in a theory tutorial. In this instance, the student is
spelling chords while a graphic representation is built on screen. If the
student&rsquo;s answer is wrong, a dinosaur foot crushes the graphic, and &ldquo;Godzilla&rdquo;
invites the student to try again. This animation was created with AddMotion.</p>

<p>[8.16] In closing, we should state that, while these are good examples
of final projects from our course, they are not atypical. We are constantly
amazed by what our students accomplish in a one-semester introduction to
multimedia programming, and it was difficult deciding which of some forty
projects that our students have done during the last three years we should
show here. Also, as we had hoped, several students have used these tools
in their own teaching at Eastman and elsewhere.</p>

<p><a NAME="anchor235518"></a>9. FUTURE DIRECTIONS (<a HREF="#anchor240524">TOC</a>)</p>

<p>[9.1] The course has been extremely popular with students in the theory
department and in other disciplines. Although we have an official cap of
10 students, the course has been over-enrolled each semester it has been
offered. Last spring (1997) we had 18 students in the class, and turned
several more away. Support for the course has also improved a great deal.
In Spring of 1996, James Undercofler, the Acting Director of the Eastman
School of Music, allocated funds from an unrestricted donation to Eastman
to begin a Multimedia Development Center. This enabled us to purchase a
much more powerful computer to use as a teaching station, and to add a color
scanner, a CD recorder, and other peripherals. Part way through the spring
1997 semester, we moved the course into a new, well-equipped computer lab.
The lab was equipped through a National Science Foundation grant obtained
by Dave Headlam and Mark Bocko, a University of Rochester electrical engineer,
for creating an interdisciplinary computer lab dedicated to computer use
for course-related work. We are currently in the process of reevaluating
the course content, and we will probably move from HyperCard to Macromedia
Director this spring. This change, whenever we make it, will involve major
reworking of teaching materials, but much of what we have learned will be
applicable in different programming environments. In our course evaluations,
many students have commented that the music- cognition part of the course
is too much in too little time&mdash;they would prefer to have a separate course
for that area and expand the emphasis on programming (scripting) in the
present course. Thus we are considering moving the music cognition component
to a separate course. This would also allow us to incorporate a unit on
developing multimedia for the web in the current course.</p>

<p>[9.2] There are probably as many styles of co-teaching a course as there
are co-teaching teams. We have viewed this course as an equal partnership
from the start. The course utilizes the individual and collective expertise
of both authors: Brinkman&rsquo;s long experience in computer programming with
music applications, and Marvin&rsquo;s work in music-cognition research and statistics.
We planned the course initially in many brain-storming sessions, and share
teaching duties in almost every class. After each class we have a &ldquo;post-mortem&rdquo;
session in which we critique the class&mdash;what worked and what didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and
make notes on things to improve the next time around. We keep our planning
notes and critiques on the computer for easy reference and review the next
time we teach the course. At this session we also set objectives for the
next class, plan the order of presentation, divide up preparation tasks,
and when necessary, review and revise plans for the next few classes. Many
assignments are graded together. When this is impossible due to time constraints,
we divide up the work and then meet to review our individual work and discuss
grades. Teacher comments are saved to a text file on student disks for each
graded assignment, which we either write together or review jointly before
returning to students.</p>

<p>[9.3] Teaching this course, even as a shared effort, has taken a tremendous
commitment of time and energy. The time required for class preparation,
solving technical problems, grading assignments, designing and implementing
experiments, and working with students on individual projects has been far
greater than that required for any other course either of has taught previously.
But the experience has also been a rewarding one, both in terms of our personal
an professional development. We have presented papers on the course at the
annual conferences of two professional societies (including SMT Baton Rouge),
and at a public forum on Technology in Music Education at the opening ceremony
of for the 75 anniversary of the founding of the Eastman school. We have
presented papers on our work in music-cognition at four national and international
cognition conferences. Our review of CD-ROM software is forthcoming in <i>Journal
of Music Theory Pedagogy</i>, and we are preparing articles on the cognition
experiments for submission to appropriate journals. Finally, as a result
of this work, the Eastman School was nominated last spring for a Smithsonian-Computer
World Award for technical innovation in education, and information on our
work is included in the permanent collection at the Smithsonian and is available
on their web site &lt;<a HREF="http://innovate.si.edu/">http://innovate.si.edu</a>&gt;.</p>
