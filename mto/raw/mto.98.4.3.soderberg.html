 The following study focuses on white note systems, certain
well-defined sets of &ldquo;tonal&rdquo; relationships arising from any m-note
subset of any n-note set.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> This (still informal) definition may seem
somewhat surprising at first since we are not accustomed to think of
tonal &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; as a random selection of notes.  But, as we shall see in
Part I, much of the &ldquo;system&rdquo; in tonal system comes less from our
selection of notes than from the ways we choose to arrange our
selection.  In the present study we will generate white note systems
using &ldquo;topological&rdquo; transformations<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>, the most basic of which is the
WARP function.  WARP maps any interval string (to be defined) from one
referential chromatic space to another via a scale string.  In the
section labelled &ldquo;Vector Transformations&rdquo; we will define a
transformation matrix which concomitantly defines interval vectors.
Vectors (as carriers of the most basic significant information between
two &ldquo;chords&rdquo;), and the way they transform, prove useful throughout
this study, but discussion of their ultimate analytical importance, or
their possible future compositional importance, lies beyond our scope.

<p id="Section1" style="text-align: center"><b>1. Interval String Theory.</b></p>

 
<p>[1.1] REFERENTIAL SPACES.  We begin by positing a referential musical
space Cm with octave equivalence; m is called the size of Cm.  A
primitive object (point) in Cm can be thought of as a pitch class (pc)
or integer mod m or as a point on a circle whose circumference is m
units.  Thus, for any primitive object p in Cm, an appropriate integer
can be assigned to p such that 0 &lt;= p &lt;= m-1.  Cm is sometimes called
a chromatic universe.  The usual chromatic C12 is the referential
space underlying the usual diatonic.
<p>

[1.2] DISTANCES.  The interval between any two pitch classes p1 and p2
in Cm is int(p1,p2) = (p2-p1) mod m.  The interval class formed by p1
and p2 is defined as ic(p1,p2) = int(p1,p2) if int(p1,p2) &lt;= [[m/2]],
otherwise ic(p1,p2) = m-int(p1,p2).
<p>

[1.3] On a circle, int(p1,p2) measures the <i>clockwise</i> circumferential
distance between p1 and p2, whereas ic(p1,p2) measures the <i>shortest</i>
distance between p1 and p2, whether clockwise or counterclockwise.
Thus in C7 int(1,5) = 4, but since [[m/2]] = [[7/2]] = 3 and
int(1,5) &gt; [[m/2]], ic(1,5) = 7-int(1,5) = 3.
<p>

[1.4] If S = {a,b<nobr>, . . . }</nobr> and T = {g,h<nobr>, . . . }</nobr> are two sets of pcs in Cm,
classic set theory defines the set-theoretic intersection of S and T
as the set containing all those elements which are common to S and T,
i.e., all elements s-in-S and t-in-T such that s = t or, what is the
same in the present context, such that int(s,t) = 0 and ic(s,t) = 0.
But in a music-theoretic context it is often important to form the set
of all pairs (s,t) in SXT such that int(s,t) is an integer other than
0.  Thus if S = {1,3,4,7} and T = {4,8,11,15} in C16, U =
{(3,4),(7,8)} in SXT is the set of pairs of pcs satisfying
int(s,t) = 1.
<p>

[1.5] In general, for s-in-S and t-in-T, intj(S,T) will represent the
set of all pairs in SXT such that int(s,t) = j; and #intj(S,T) will
indicate the cardinality of the set intj(S,T), or equivalently, the
&ldquo;multiplicity&rdquo; of j in SXT.  Thus in the example just cited we can
write int1(S,T) = {(3,4),(7,8)} and #int1(S,T) = 2.  Obviously,
int0(S,T) is identical to the intersection S.^.T; so both expressions
can be used to define the set of &ldquo;common tones&rdquo; between S and T.
icj(S,T) and #icj(S,T) are similarly defined.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p>

[1.6] An important special case of [1.5] appears when T = S, that is,
when all pairs of pcs (s,t) belong to SXS.  intj(S,S) and #intj(S,S)
are straightforward, and we will write intj(S) and #intj(S) to
indicate the discrete pairs of pcs <i>in</i> S separated by intj and the
cardinality of that set of pairs, respectively.  But icj(S,S) is not
the same as icj(S) since #icj(S) is always half the value of
#icj(S,S).  Every instance of icj is counted twice (once &ldquo;up&rdquo; and once
&ldquo;down&rdquo;) in icj(S,S), but the pairs of icj-related pitch classes <i>in</i>
S are (traditionally) unordered and so (s,t) and (t,s) are counted as
one.  So it is important to remember that (while intj(S,S) = intj(S))
icj(S,S) and icj(S) are different, but closely related, sets.  E.g.,
if S = {0,1,3,9,10} in C12, then int2(S,S) = int2(S) = {(1,3),(10,0)};
int10(S,S) = int10(S) = {(3,1),(0,10)}; ic2(S,S) =
{(1,3),(3,1),(10,0),(0,10)}; but ic2(S) = {(1,3),(10,0)}.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup><p>

[1.7] INTERVAL STRINGS.  An interval string in Cm is an ordered
n-tuple of integers s = &lt;i1,i2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>in&gt; whose elements sum to m.  Thus
&lt;111215421&gt; is an interval string in C18; &lt;345&gt;, &lt;4332&gt;, and
&lt;21212121&gt; are interval strings in C12.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p>

[1.8] A substring of the interval string s is any ordered k-tuple r =
/j1,j2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>jk/ where j1<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>jk are k consecutive elements of s.  If
s = &lt;111215421&gt;, /5421/, /111/, /5/, /21/ are substrings of s.  /42111/
is also a substring since s is circular.  /254/ is not a substring
since it consists of non-consecutive intervals of s, and /512/ is not
a substring of s since it presents consecutive intervals but in
retrograde.
<p>

[1.9] Given any string s = &lt;i1,i2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>in&gt; in Cm, we can form the
string inversion of s, s&prime; = &lt;-i1,-i2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>-in&gt; mod m = &lt;in<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>i2,i1&gt;.
In other words, we are identifying a simple retrograde of a string
(the reverse ordering of a circularly ordered n-tuple) with an
&ldquo;inversion&rdquo; (mod m) of that string.  This identification will be
clarified below in [1.14].
<p>

[1.10] STRUCTURES.  Given a pitch class p and a string s =
&lt;i1,i2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>in&gt;, any structure (complex object) in Cm can be fully
described by naming the ordered pair (p,s) which represents the set
{pk : pk is the sum of p and the first k elements of s (k =
0,1<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>n-1) mod m}.  For any structure in Cm, the shape and
orientation of that structure are given by s, and the location of that
structure is given by p.  Contextually, (p,s) might be referred to as
a pc-set, chord, scale, sonority, or polygon-inscribed-in-a-circle
(the latter being a particularly useful metaphor in what follows).
The pitch class p might be referred to as an initial, base, or root of
(p,s).  We will write ps in place of (p,s) where the context is clear.
<p>

[1.11] The notation (p,s) will be recognized as a generalization of
the (p,sign) notation introduced by David Lewin.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> If p is any pitch
class in C12, &ldquo;+&rdquo; indicates &ldquo;major,&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; indicates &ldquo;minor,&rdquo; then
for example, (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>,+) indicates a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> major triad and (F,-) an F minor
triad (in any inversion).  Replacing &ldquo;sign&rdquo; with &ldquo;interval string,&rdquo;
assigning <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> = 1, and stipulating the interval string x = &lt;435&gt;, we
may also write (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>,+) = (1,x) = 1x = {1,1+4,1+4+3} = {1,5,8} = any
major (diatonic) triad whose root is <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>.
<p>

[1.12] Extending this nomenclature to virtually any pc-set in any
referential space is then quite simple.  Using the previous examples
in [1.7], if we define s = &lt;111215421&gt; then the structure (klang, set,
chord, scale) named 3s is the (unordered) pc-set {3,4,5,6,8,9,14,0,2}
in C18.  If we set t = &lt;345&gt;, u = &lt;4332&gt;, and v = &lt;21212121&gt;, then 7t
= {7,10,2} (a G minor triad), 2u = {2,6,9,0} (a D major dominant
seventh chord), and 5v = {5,7,8,10,11,1,2,4} (an octatonic scale on
F).
<p>

[1.13] While any two circular permutations of a given string express
the same shape, care must be taken when naming a pc-set.  s = &lt;3142&gt;
and t = &lt;4231&gt; are circular permutations of one another and therefore
describe the same shape in C10, however for any p in C10, (p,s) is not
the same set as (p,t), but (p,s) and (p+4,t) <i>are</i> equal.
<p>

[1.14] We can now clarify the idea of equating &ldquo;inversion&rdquo; and
&ldquo;retrograde&rdquo; (with respect to string relationships) introduced in
[1.9].  If s = &lt;1,1,2,4&gt; in C8, its inversion (by the definition in
[1.9]) is s&prime; = &lt;-1,-1,-2,-4&gt; mod 8 = &lt;7,7,6,4&gt;.  This is not a
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; string as defined in [1.7] where the elements of a string are
required to sum to m.  We can find a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; string representation of
s&prime; in C8 as follows.  If we identify s&prime; with the root 0, forming the
structure 0s&prime; = {0,7,6,4}, and rearrange 0s&prime; in ascending order as,
say, 0s&Prime; = {0,4,6,7}, we see that s&Prime; = &lt;4,2,1,1&gt; and thus s&Prime; is a
retrograde of s.
<p>

[1.15] The traditional concept of &ldquo;set class&rdquo; can be expressed with
string notation in the following way.  If s is a string in Cm and s&prime;
is the retrograde of s, the set class S is the set of all structures
(p,s).&amp;.(p,s&prime;) for all values of p in Cm.  By analogy we also define
the concept &ldquo;string class&rdquo; as the set of all strings s.&amp;.s&prime; for all
circular permutations of s.
<p>

[1.16] If S = ps and T = qt are two sets (structures) in Cm, where p,q
are pcs and s,t are strings, certain operations on sets can be written
in terms of operations on the strings alone.  For instance, #icj(S) =
#icj(s), where #intj(s) counts the number of instances of icj in the
string s (e.g., if s = &lt;1123&gt;, #ic2(s) = 2).  But other operations
cannot be so transferred, e.g., #icj(S,T) is meaningful but #icj(s,t)
is undefined.

<p id="Section2" style="text-align: center"><b>2. Generating White Note Systems.</b></p> 
 
<p>[2.1] &ldquo;TOPOLOGICAL&rdquo; TRANSFORMATIONS BETWEEN REFERENTIAL SPACES.  Given
a k-element set A in the referential space Cm and a second referential
space Cn, the &ldquo;topological&rdquo; transformation (TT)
<p>
<center>
	R: A-in-Cm --&gt; B-in-Cn
</center>
<p>
is the mapping, according to some rule R, of each of the k elements of
A-in-Cm to a corresponding element in Cn which, taken together, form
the k-element set B-in-Cn.
<p>

[2.2] A TT can be represented by imagining Cm and Cn to be circles
drawn on a plane surface with a peg at each of the m and n equally
spaced points on their respective circumferences and imagining A as a
rubber band stretched between k of Cm&rsquo;s pegs to form a polygon.  A TT
describes how, according to some rule, the rubber band is removed from
Cm&rsquo;s pegs and placed on k of Cn&rsquo;s pegs.
<p>

[2.3] If n = m, the transformations are <i>within</i> the space Cm.  Here,
two well known TT&rsquo;s of any set are transposition (rotating A in Cm)
and simple inversion (flipping A around some axis, still in Cm).  In
both of these cases the TT retains a structure&rsquo;s basic shape, i.e.,
these mappings are conformal.
<p>

[2.4] If n &gt; m or n &lt; m, however, the most notable thing about the TT
of the rubber band is not so much which pegs it vacates in Cm and
which pegs it then occupies in Cn, but how its k sides are warped
(stretched or shrunk),
<p>
<center>
	R: A-string --&gt; B-string.
</center>
<p>
Thus a transformation which takes A from a smaller space to a larger
space, or vice versa, often changes the characteristic shape of A,
i.e., these are often non-conformal mappings.  We will now define a
non-conformal TT with n &gt; m called a WARP function.
<p>

[2.5] WARP FUNCTION &mdash; DEFINITION.  If q = &lt;q1,q2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>qk&gt; is a string
in Cm and r = &lt;r1,r2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>rm&gt; is a string in Cn such that (k = #(q)) &lt;=
(m = SUM(q) = #(r)) &lt;= (n = SUM(r)), then the r-WARP of q is defined
as the string in Cn,
<p>
<center>
	s = WARP(q,r) = &lt;q1r,q2r<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>qkr&gt;,
</center>
<p>
where q1r = the sum of the first q1 elements of r, q2r = the sum of
the next q2 elements of r<nobr>, . . . , </nobr> and qkr = the sum of the final qk
elements of r.  To accord with the terminology first introduced by
John Clough and Gerald Myerson<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> now in general use, any three
interval strings in the relationship described by the above definition
of WARP will be refered to as a generic string (q), scale string (r),
and specific string (s).
<p>

[2.6] The WARP function isn&rsquo;t as complex as it might appear at first
glance.  All that is required is any pair of strings q and r such that
the (arithmetic) sum of the elements in q is equal to the cardinality
of r.  q can then be WARPed into a new string s by collecting r&rsquo;s
elements into q-counted substrings and arithmetically summing the
elements in each substring.  Thus q is &ldquo;scaled&rdquo; by or through r.
<p>

[2.7] If q is the string &lt;2243&gt; it can be WARPed by any string
containing 2+2+4+3 = 11 elements.  If we choose r = &lt;11211311111&gt; then
the r-WARP of q is WARP(q,r) = s = &lt;(1+1),(2+1),(1+3+1+1),(1+1+1)&gt; =
&lt;2363&gt;, and q-in-C11 has WARPed into s-in-C14.  If x = &lt;31134112222&gt;
then WARP(q,x) = &lt;4486&gt; = y, and q-in-C11 has WARPed into y-in-C22.
<p>

[2.8] The example in [2.7] demonstrates that the same generic string
can WARP into different specific strings by varying the scale string.
The following example shows that different generic strings can WARP
into the same specific string.  Let a = &lt;214&gt;, b = &lt;1231222&gt;, c =
&lt;321&gt;, d = &lt;111217&gt;.  Then WARP(a,b) = WARP(c,d) = &lt;337&gt; = s, and both
a-in-C7 and b-in-C6 have WARPed into s-in-C13.
<p>

[2.9] WARP is associative with respect to composition:
<p>
<center>
	WARP(WARP(x,y),z) = WARP(x,WARP(y,z));
</center>
<p>
therefore WARP(w,x,y<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>z) is unambiguous given appropriately defined
strings w,x,y<nobr>, . . . , </nobr> z.
<p>

[2.10] We will define the order of a (composite) WARP as the number of
strings in the composition.  Thus WARP(x,y) is a second-order WARP and
WARP(w,x,y,z) is a fourth-order WARP.  The special case of a
first-order WARP will be defined below in [2.13].  Note that, no
matter what the order of the composite WARP, the cardinality of the
generic string is the cardinality of the specific string, and the size
of the space in which the final scale string is embedded is the size
of the space in which the specific string is embedded.
<p>

[2.11] For an example of a third-order WARP, let a = &lt;112&gt;, b =
&lt;2131&gt;, c = &lt;1122142&gt;.  Then
<pre>
	WARP(WARP(a,b),c)
		= WARP(WARP(<112>,<2131>),<1122142>)
		= WARP(<214>,<1122142>)
		= <229> 
	= WARP(a,WARP(b,c))
		= WARP(<112>,WARP(<2131>,<1122142>)
		= WARP(<112>,<2272>)
		= <229>
	= WARP(a,b,c).
</pre>
<p>[2.12] Identity for WARP is defined as an appropriately sized string
of unit intervals &lt;1<nobr>, . . . ,</nobr> 1&gt;.  Let I identify a generic (left identity)
string and let J identify a scale (right identity) string such that
#(I) = SUM(I) = m and #(J) = SUM(J) = n (with m &lt;= n).  For any string
x such that #(x) = m and SUM(x) = n,
<p>
<center>
	WARP(I,x) = WARP(x,J) = WARP(I,x,J) = x,
</center>
<p>
even though I does not equal J unless m = n.  Note that I is Cm&rsquo;s
interval string and J is Cn&rsquo;s interval string, i.e., for points
e-in-Cm and f-in-Cn, Cm = (e,I) and Cn = (f,J).
<p>

[2.13] In noting the order of a composite WARP, we will ignore any
(normally suppressed) identity strings.  Thus if I and J are
identities, WARP(I,a,b,J,c,d) = WARP(a,b,c,d) is a fourth-order WARP,
not a sixth-order WARP.  Any string can therefore be viewed as a
first-order WARP, i.e., x = WARP(I,x) or WARP(x,J), depending on our
perspective.
<p>

[2.14] WARPs are generally non-commutative, i.e., WARP(a,b) does not
equal WARP(b,a) unless a = b = I = J.  Furthermore, if a does not
equal b, then at least one or the other of WARP(a,b) and WARP(b,a) is
undefined since SUM(a) = #(b) and SUM(b) = #(a) cannot both be true.
<p>

[2.15] We may now extend the WARP function by collecting circular
permutations of the generic and scale strings.  This will result in
the set of all WARP-related strings within a given scale string.  But
WARPSET is more than just a mere list since the generic and scale
strings&rsquo; structures are reflected in the relationships between the
individual WARPs.  This will become especially apparent when both
generic and scale strings are symmetric.
<p>

[2.16] WARPSET FUNCTION &mdash; DEFINITION.  If q and r are strings as in
[2.5] (#(q) = k and #(r) = m),
<pre>
	S = WARPSET(q,r) 
	        = {WARP(q(u),r(v)) : u = 0<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>k-1; v = 0<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>m-1},
</pre>
<p>where q(u) and r(v) are the u-th and v-th circular permutation of the
generic string q and the scale string r respectively.  WARPSET thus
generates a set S of specific strings<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> by &ldquo;rotating&rdquo; the generic and
scale strings.  Since varying both u and v results in duplications (as
circular permutations), we will set u = 0 and only consider
<pre>
	S = WARPSET(q,r)
		= {WARP(q(0),r(v)) : v = 0<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>m-1}.
</pre>
<p>We will refer to this fixing of one generic string as the WARPSET
convention.
<p>

[2.17] For an example of WARPSET, let q = q(0) = &lt;124&gt; and let r(0) =
&lt;1121322&gt; be the zero-th permutation of r.  This will yield the
following set of WARPs S = {WARP(q(0),r(v)}:
<p>


<table border>
<tr><td><b>v</b><td><b>r(v)</b><td><b>S</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>0<td>1121322<td>138</td>
<tr><td>1<td>1213221<td>138</td>
<tr><td>2<td>2132211<td>246</td>
<tr><td>3<td>1322112<td>156</td>
<tr><td>4<td>3221121<td>345</td>
<tr><td>5<td>2211213<td>237</td>
<tr><td>6<td>2112132<td>228</td>
</table>

<p>

[2.18] As demonstrated by the example in [2.17] where WARP(q(0),r(0))
= WARP(q(0),r(1)), different permutations of the scale string will
often result in the same ordered set of sums, so all of the specific
strings in the WARPSET S are not necessarily unique.  Nevertheless,
since identical strings in S will combine with different pcs to form
distinct structures in CHORDSET below in [2.22], WARPSET&rsquo;s cardinality
will be defined as #(S) = #(r) = m.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup><p>

[2.19] If q&prime; and r&prime; are the inversions of the generic string q and the
scale string r, respectively, then
<p>
<center>
	WARPSET(q&prime;,r&prime;) = MIRROR(WARPSET(q,r));
</center>
<p>
that is, every string in WARPSET(q&prime;,r&prime;) is some inversion of a string
in WARPSET(q,r).<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup><p>

[2.20] When both the generic and scale strings are symmetric (i.e.,
when there is a circular permutation which, when read in reverse,
reproduces the string), some of the most interesting relationships
appear in the form of a symmetric patterning of the set of resultant
specific strings.  A detailed categorization and discussion of these
internal symmetries is beyond the scope of the present study, so we
will simply note here that symmetries among the set of specific
strings resulting from a WARPSET are, at least in part a result of the
degrees (and kinds) of symmetry possessed by the generic and scale
strings.  As an example, let q = q(0) = &lt;1133&gt; and let r(0) =
&lt;12311321&gt; be the zero-th permutation of r.  Both of these strings
have one degree of inversional symmetry, but the order of the scale
strings produced by the rotation of the scale string shows a curious
sort of &ldquo;skew-symmetric&rdquo; pattern:
<p>


<table border>
<tr><td><b>v</b><td><b>r(v)</b><td><b>S</b><td><b>Name</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>0<td>12311321<td>1256<td>a</td>
<tr><td>1<td>23113211<td>2354<td>b</td>
<tr><td>2<td>31132112<td>3164<td>c</td>
<tr><td>3<td>11321123<td>1166<td>d</td>
<tr><td>4<td>13211231<td>1346<td>c&prime;</td>
<tr><td>5<td>32112311<td>3245<td>b&prime;</td>
<tr><td>6<td>21123113<td>2165<td>a&prime;</td>
<tr><td>7<td>11231132<td>1166<td>d</td>
</table>

<p>

Specific strings in S with the same letter name belong to the same
string class in C14 (here the prime mark indicates the inversion of
some rotation of the indicated string).  So this WARPSET, whose
cardinality is 8, has generated four distinct string classes, three of
which are asymmetric.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup><p>

[2.21] While WARPSET can tell us a great deal about the relationsips
between WARP-generated strings, it still doesn&rsquo;t fix the precise
positions of these strings with respect to one another.  This is
necessary to adequately describe and examine &ldquo;progressions&rdquo; (chord
pairs) within a given WARP-system.  The general description &ldquo;from
string x to string y&rdquo; conveys little information since, although the
&ldquo;shapes&rdquo; or &ldquo;character&rdquo; of the termini may have been stipulated, their
locations have not.  The difference is similar to that between &ldquo;from a
major triad to a minor triad&rdquo; and &ldquo;from a C-major triad to a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>-minor
triad.&rdquo;  By fixing chord positions, CHORDSET makes it possible to
measure distances (i.e., to calculate and compare spanning vectors) as
well as to identify points of incidence (common tones) and &ldquo;voice-
leading&rdquo; subsets between WARP-related sets.
<p>

[2.22] CHORDSET FUNCTION &mdash; DEFINITION.  Let q(0) be a generic string
in Cm and r(v) be the v-th circular permutation of the scale string r
= &lt;r1,r2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>rk&gt; in Cn (0 &lt;= v &lt;= k-1); and let s(v) =
WARP(q(0),r(v)).  The chord structure (pv,s(v)) is a subset of the
scale structure (0,r(0)) = {p0,p1,p2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>pk-1} where p0=0; p1=r1;
p2=r1+r2;<nobr> . . . ;</nobr> pk-1=r1+r2<nobr>+ . . . +</nobr>(rk-1).
<p>
<center>
	CHORDSET(q,r) = {(pv,s(v)) : v=0<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>k-1}
</center>
<p>
is then the set of k <i>distinct</i> subsets of (0,r(0)) generated by
WARPSET(q,r).
<p>

[2.23] CHORDSET concretizes a scale structure and procedes to assign
one, and only one, specific interval string to each of its (pc)
elements.  Since the WARPSET convention holds the generic string
constant, the result is a set of distinct WARP-related chords, each
one of which is &ldquo;built&rdquo; on a &ldquo;scale degree.&rdquo;
<p>

[2.24] Continuing the WARPSET example in [2.20], let q = q(0) = &lt;1133&gt;
and let r(0) = &lt;12311321&gt; be the zero-th permutation of r.  Given the
referential scale (0,r(0)) = {0,1,3,6,7,8,11,13}, CHORDSET yields the
following WARP-related structures (pv,s(v)) corresponding to the set
of specific strings s(v):
<p>


<table border>
<tr><td><b>v</b><td><b>r(v)</b><td><b>s(v)</b><td><b>pv</b><td><b>(pv,s(v))</b><td><b>Name</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>0<td>12311321<td>1256<td>0<td>{0,1,3,8}<td>0a</td>
<tr><td>1<td>23113211<td>2354<td>1<td>{1,3,6,11}<td>1b</td>
<tr><td>2<td>31132112<td>3164<td>3<td>{3,6,7,13}<td>3c</td>
<tr><td>3<td>11321123<td>1166<td>6<td>{6,7,8,0}<td>6d</td>
<tr><td>4<td>13211231<td>1346<td>7<td>{7,8,11,1}<td>7c&prime;</td>
<tr><td>5<td>32112311<td>3245<td>8<td>{8,11,13,3}<td>8b&prime;</td>
<tr><td>6<td>21123113<td>2165<td>11<td>{11,13,0,6}<td>11a&prime;</td>
<tr><td>7<td>11231132<td>1166<td>13<td>{13,0,1,7}<td>13d</td>
</table>

<p>

[2.25] We may now formally define a white note system (or
WARP-generated system) as the ordered triple (A,B,C), where A is a set
of WARPSET-generated (specific) strings, B is a scale used as a basis
for CHORDSET, and C is the corresponding set of chords generated from
A and B via CHORDSET.  So in the example just given, A = {s(v)}, B =
{pv}, C = {(pv,s(v))} for all values of v.
<p>

<p id="Section3" style="text-align: center"><b>3. Vector Transformations.</b></p>

<p>[3.1] Thus far we have developed a family of WARP functions which
methodically generate white note systems.  We are now in a position to
study transformations between those systems that are somewhat akin to
coordinate transformations&mdash;at least this will be seen as the
underlying metaphor.  After introducing the interval multiplicity
matrix and relating it to WARP, we will apply it to a brief study of
interval and interval-class vector transformations.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup><p>

[3.2] INTERVAL MULTIPLICITY MATRICES.  Given any string r in Cs (s =
SUM(r)), let r;x,y be a non-reduced set of substrings of r where x is
the number of elements in the substring and y is the sum of the
elements in the substring, with 1 &lt;= x &lt;= #(r) and 1 &lt;= y &lt;=
SUM(r).<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> We then define the int-multiplicity matrix (or simply
int-matrix)
<p>
<center>
	MINT(r) = [exy]
</center>
<p>
for WARP(I,r) = r, where entry exy = #(r;x,y).

[3.3] For example, if r = &lt;124113&gt;, then r;1,4 = {/4/}, r;2,2 =
{/11/}, r;2,4 = {/13/,/31/}, r;3,6 = {/312/,/411/}, r;4,6 = {/1131/},
r;1,1 = {/1/,/1/,/1/}, r;2,8 = {}, etc.  MINT(r) then counts the
number of elements in each set of substrings and displays them thus:

</pre>
<p>The right column labelled U(I) and the bottom row labelled U(r) are
not properly part of the matrix.  Their presence here will be
explained shortly.  The left column (x) and the top row (y) are the
exy indices and will normally be omitted unless necessary for
clarity&mdash;but they will often be referred to.
<p>

[3.4] NB: We will assume that if x = #(r) and y = SUM(r) then exy =
#(r); so in the example #(r;6,12) = 6, not 1.  In effect, this matrix
element counts the circular permutations of r.
<p>

[3.5] We will need to distinguish below (e.g. in [3.21]) between <i>all</i>
the elements of a row (or column) and only the non-zero elements of
that row (or column).  Thus the ordered tuple of non-zero elements of
row x (read consecutively from left to right) will be referenced as 
ROWx; but if we are refering to <i>all</i> the elements in row x we will 
write rowx.  Similarly, the non-zero elements of column y (read from 
top to bottom) will be referenced as COLy; and coly will refer to <i>all</i>
of column y&rsquo;s elements.  In the example in [3.3], 
row5 = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,0], ROW5 = [1,1,1,3], col7 = [0,0,2,1,0,0], 
and COL7 = [2,1].
<p>

[3.6] Any int-matrix has its own two-fold inversional symmetry, i.e.,
ignoring the #(r)-row and the SUM(r)-column, every row (and ROW) has 
an inversion mod #(r) and every col (and COL) has an inversion mod SUM(r).
Thus row5 in the example in [3.3] is the inversion of row1, and col7 is
the inversion of col5.
<p>

[3.7] The following propositions relate MINT(r) to WARP(I,r).
<ul>

  (1) The sum of (non-zero) entries in ROWx of 
MINT(r) is the multiplicity of interval x in 
string I which, by the definition of WARP, must 
be the same as the number of elements in string 
r; i.e., for any x,<p>
<ul>
	SUM(ROWx) = #intx(I) = #(r).
</ul>
<p>
  (2) The number of entries in rowx of MINT(r) 
(including zeroes) is the sum of the elements in 
string r; i.e., for any x,<p>
<ul>
	#(rowx) = SUM(r).
</ul>
<p>
  (3) The sum of (non-zero) entries in COLy of 
MINT(r) is the multiplicity of interval y in 
string r; i.e., for any y,<p>
<ul>
	SUM(COLy) = #inty(r).
</ul>
<p>
  (4) The number of entries in coly of MINT(r) 
(including zeroes) is the sum of the elements in 
string I which, by the definition of an identity 
string, must be the same as the number of 
elements in I; i.e., for any y,<p>
<ul>
	#(coly) = SUM(I) = #(I).
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
<p>[3.8] For I = &lt;111111&gt; and r = &lt;124113&gt;, if x = 4, say, then
<ul>

  (1) SUM(ROW4) = #int4(I) = #(r) = 6, and<br>
  (2) #(row4) = SUM(r) = 12.</ul>

<p>If we set y = 7, then
<ul>

  (3) SUM(COL7) = #int7(r) = 3, and<br>
  (4) #(col7) = SUM(I) = #(I) = 6.

</ul>
<p>[3.9] INTERVAL VECTORS.  From (1) and (3) in [3.7] we define two
interval-vectors derived from MINT(r) and hence associated with
WARP(I,r).
<ul>

  (1) Let g = SUM(I).  The interval vector U(I) 
is the ordered g-tuple [a1,a2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>ag] comprised 
of the sums of the rows of MINT(r) such that, 
for any x, vector component ax = #intx(I) = 
SUM(ROWx).
<p>

  (2) Let h = SUM(r).  The interval vector U(r) 
is the ordered h-tuple [b1,b2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>bh] comprised 
of the sums of the columns of MINT(r) such that, 
for any y, vector component by = #inty(r) = 
SUM(COLy).

</ul>
<p>[3.10] Again using r = &lt;124113&gt; and referring to the display of
MINT(r) above in [3.3], U(I) = [666666] (displayed in the right
column) and U(r) = [322334332236] (displayed in the bottom row).<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup><p>

[3.11] Now suppose we are given two transposition-related chords S =
(p,r) and T = (p+y,r), where p is a pitch class in Cs and 1 &lt;= y &lt;= (s
= #(r)).  The multiplicity of any interval z connecting, or spanning,
S and T is given by<p>
<ul>
	#intz(S,T) = SUM(COLy&prime;),
</ul>
<p>
where y&prime; = y-z.
<p>

[3.12] If z = 0, [3.11] reduces to an int-matrix version of the
common-tone theorem for transposition from atonal theory; i.e., if T
is the y-transpose of S, the number of common tones shared by S and T
is #int0(S,T) = SUM(COLy).
<p>

[3.13] Keeping r = &lt;124113&gt;, if p = 7 and y = 8, S = (7,r) =
{7,8,10,2,3,4} and T = (7+8,r) = (3,r) = {3,4,6,10,11,0}.  S and T
share three tones (pc3, pc4, pc10), or what is the same, there are
three pcs in S that are int0 from three pcs in T.  Checking MINT(r),
we see that SUM(COL8) is 3, as is, of course, the value of element b8
in U(r).
<p>

[3.14] But [3.11] says more than this.  If we wish to know the
multiplicity of int1 spanning S and T, we can set z = 1 so that y&prime; =
y-z = 7.  Then we may read #int1(S,T) = SUM(COL7) = 3 from MINT(r) or
simply read the value for b7 in U(r).  This suggests collecting these
multiplicities of spanning intervals into a spanning vector which can
be used to describe pairs of structures.
<p>

[3.15] Given the sets S and T under the conditions described in
[3.11], the vector U(S,T) is the ordered h-tuple [c1,c2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>ch] where
h = SUM(r).  Any vector entry cz = #intz(S,T) = SUM(COLy&prime;).
<p>

[3.16] To remain consistent with the notation for U(r) and the most
natural display of MINT(r), we will stipulate that 1 &lt;= z &lt;= SUM(r).
So if T is the y-transpose of S, the vector comprised of intervals
spanning S and T can be read from MINT(r) by going to column y and
listing column sums to the left (counter-clockwise) beginning with
column y-1.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup><p>

[3.17] For r = &lt;124113&gt; again, let S = {7,8,10,2,3,4} and T =
{3,4,6,10,11,0} as in [3.13].  T is the transposition of S at y = 8,
so we refer to column 8 of MINT(r) (or component b8 of U(r)) and read
the column sums (vector component values) leftward beginning with
coly-1 = col7; so U(S,T) = [343322363223].  This 12-tuple tells us
that, between S and T, #int1 = 3, #int2 = 4<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>#int11 = 2, and
#int12 = #int0 = 3.  Also note that for y = 0, U(S,T) = U(S,S) = U(r)
as we would expect.
<p>

[3.18] One interesting feature of int-matrices is how they reflect
certain string patterns.  Let us define a clone string of order n as
any interval string c consisting only of n consecutive identical
substrings.  We recognize n as the number of degrees of
transpositional (rotational) symmetry (DTS) from atonal set theory.
Thus c = &lt;132&gt; in C6 can be considered as a clone string of order 1
(DTS = 1).  c can then generate the second order clone string c&prime; =
&lt;132132&gt; in C12 (DTS = 2), the third order clone string c&Prime; =
&lt;132132132&gt; in C18 (DTS = 3), and so on.  The clone pattern then
appears in the int-matrix of the clone string.  For c = &lt;132&gt;,
<pre>
	           /  1 1 1 0 0 0  \ 
	MINT(c) =  |  0 0 1 1 1 0  |
	           \  0 0 0 0 0 3  /
</pre>
<p>for c = &lt;132132&gt;,
<pre>
	            /  2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \
	            |  0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  |
	MINT(c&prime;) =  |  0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0  |
	            |  0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0  |
	            |  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0  |
	            \  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6  /
</pre>
<p>and, generally, for the n-th order clone string c = &lt;132<nobr> . . . </nobr>132&gt;, the
int-matrix will be of the form
<pre>
	/  n  n  n  0  0  0                      \
	|  0  0  n  n  n  0                      |
	|  0  0  0  0  0 3n                      |
	|                   .                    |
	|                    .                   |
	|                     .                  |
	|                      n  n  n  0  0  0  |
	|                      0  0  n  n  n  0  |
	\                      0  0  0  0  0 3n  /
</pre>
<p>In other words, the int-matrix of the original string is multiplied by
n and repeated n times down the diagonal.
<p>

[3.19] Although the clone feature will not be dwelled upon in this
study, when we come to the section on efficient linear transformations
we will see how reducing a clone string can simplify the treatment of
seemingly complex structures.  For instance, that the string &lt;12&gt;
supports efficient linear transformations will be seen to imply that
any string &lt;1212<nobr> . . . </nobr>12&gt; is saturated with these transformations as
well.
<p>

[3.20] INTERVAL VECTOR TRANSFORMATIONS.  For any generic string q, the
int-matrix of the scale string r can be interpreted as a vector
transformation matrix for WARP(q,r) = s.  In other words, as q maps to
s via an r-WARP, U(q) maps to U(s) via MINT(r).  This is possible
because I and q (which can contain no interval other than those in I)
both belong to the same referential space, say, Ca.  So a generic
interval in q (represented by one of the matrix&rsquo;s index values x) maps
into r&rsquo;s space Cb to some specific interval in s (represented by one
of the index values y corresponding to a non-zero matrix entry).<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
This situation can be summarized in our present symbolism as<p>
<ul>

	x-in-Ca --&gt; {y-in-Cb : exy-in-MINT(r) &gt; 0}.

</ul>
<p>
Thus for r = &lt;124113&gt; we can construct the interval map:
<pre>
	x-in-C6 --&gt; y-in-C12
	   1        1,2,3,4
	   2        2,3,4,5,6
	   3        5,6,7
	   4        6,7,8,9,10
	   5        8,9,10,11
	   6        12
</pre>
<p>If the generic int1 is present in q-in-C6, for example, it will map
specifically to either int1, int2, int3, or int4 in s-in-C12.
<p>

[3.21] When COLy has more than one element we have the situation
labelled an &ldquo;ambiguity&rdquo; by Jay Rahn<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> (e.g., in MINT(r) for r =
&lt;124113&gt;, y = 3 has two possible x-values, i.e., COL3 = [1,1])
so #COL3 = 2.  In presenting vector transformations (and especially
later when we investigate efficient linear transformations in Part II)
it will be important to distinguish between partitioned matrices (ones 
free of ambiguities<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup>) and non-partitioned matrices.
<p>

[3.22] If the number of (non-zero) elements in COLy is less than 2 for
every value of y, then we will say that MINT(r) is partitioned.  This
in turn identifies a partition of U(s) in such a way that any
component in U(q) equals (maps to) the sum of some discrete
combination of components in U(s).
<p>

[3.23] An example of a partition is the following based on r =
&lt;3322332&gt; whose int-matrix
<pre>
	/  0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \
	|  0 0 0 1 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  |
	|  0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  |
	|  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  |
	|  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 1 0 0 0 0  |
	|  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 0 0  |
	\  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7  /
</pre>
<p>yields the interval map
<pre>
	x-in-C7 --&gt; y-in-C18
	   1        2,3
	   2        4,5,6
	   3        7,8
	   4        10,11
	   5        12,13,14
	   6        15,16
	   7        18.
</pre>
<p>Since MINT(r) is partitioned in this example, U(r) is also partitioned
as [@;ROW1;ROW2;ROW3;@;ROW4;ROW5;ROW6;@;ROW7] =
[@;34;142;25;@;52;241;43;@;7], where &ldquo;@&rdquo; indicates a &ldquo;dead&rdquo; zero&mdash;a
component from an empty column which can&rsquo;t take part in any r-based
transformation.
<p>

[3.24] We can then define a partition-sum vector by summing all the
ROWs and dropping the dead zeroes:<p>
<ul>
	U&prime;(r) = [SUM(ROW1),SUM(ROW2)<nobr>, . . . ].</nobr>
</ul>
<p>
Thus in the current example, U&prime;(r) = [3+4,1+4+2,2+5,5+2,2+4+1,4+3,7] =
[7777777] = U(I).
<p>

[3.25] But more interesting is that, whenever we are using a scale
string r that has a partitioned int-matrix, the vector transformation
U(I) --&gt; U(r) from the identity U&prime;(r) = U(I) for WARP(I,r) = r,
implies the &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; of transformations U(q) --&gt; U(s) from U&prime;(s) =
U(q) for WARP(q,r) = s.
<p>

[3.26] For example, given q = &lt;2131&gt; and r = &lt;3322332&gt; so that
WARP(q,r) = s = &lt;6282&gt;, we can calculate separately that U(q) =
[2133124] and U(s) = [020001030301000204].  U(s) is partitioned after
U(r) as [@;20;001;03;@;30;100;02;@;4] and U&prime;(s) =
[2+0,0+0+1,0+3,3+0,1+0+0,0+2,4] = U(q).
<p>

[3.27] This rather cumbersome notation will now be simplified
considerably by the use of interval class notation.  But we will of
necessity return to the int-matrix display when we investigate
voice-leading generally and efficient linear transformations
specifically in Part II.
<p>

[3.28] IC-MATRICES.  Let us now reduce all values of x and y in r;x,y
to their interval class values.  Let j,k be integers such that 1 &lt;= j
&lt;= [[#(r)/2]] and 1 &lt;= k &lt;= [[SUM(r)/2]].  We may then define the
ic-multiplicity matrix (or simply ic-matrix)<p>
<ul>
	MIC(r) = [fjk]
</ul>
<p>
for WARP(I,r) = r, where entry fjk = #(r;j,k) except when #(r) is even
and j = #(r)/2, in which case fjk = #(r;j,k)/2.
<p>

[3.29] For r = &lt;124113&gt;, MIC(r) can then be displayed:
<pre>
<ul>
      k| 1  2  3  4  5  6 |
   j   |                  | V(I)
   ----|------------------|-----
   1   | 3  1  1  1  0  0 |  6
       |                  |
   2   | 0  1  1  2  1  1 |  6
       |                  |
   3   | 0  0  0  0  2  1 |  3
   ----|------------------|-----
       |                  |
   V(r)| 3  2  2  3  3  2 |
       |                  |
</ul>
</pre>
<p>Note that, since both I and r belong to even spaces in the example,
element f36 in MIC(r) is half of e36 in MINT(r).
<p>

[3.30] IC-VECTORS.  The sums of the columns of MIC(r) form the
(generalized) Forte ic-vector <sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> of the specific string r which we
will call V(r).  So for r = &lt;124113&gt; we can read V(r)= [322332].
Likewise, the sums of the rows of MIC(r) form the ic-vector of the
identity generic string I.  Here I = &lt;111111&gt; so V(I) = [663].
<p>

[3.31] As above, we can use the ic-matrix to map interval classes
through WARPs.  Continuing with the example in [3.29], MIC(r) yields
the ic-map
<pre>
	j-in-C6 --&gt; k-in-C12
	   1        1,2,3,4
	   2        2,3,4,5,6
	   3        5,6
</pre>
<p>[3.32] If MINT(r) is partitioned, then MIC(r) will be considered
partitioned as well, and we can refer to ROWj and COLk of MIC(r) and
create a partition-sum vector V&prime; without complications.  If r =
&lt;3322332&gt; (see [3.23]), MIC(r) is partitioned:
<pre>
	/  0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0  \
	|  0 0 0 1 4 2 0 0 0  |
	\  0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5 0  /
</pre>
<p>So the ic-map
<pre>
	j-in-C7 --&gt; k-in-C18
	   1         2,3
	   2         4,5,6
	   3         7,8
</pre>
<p>can be used to relate V(q) and V(s) in WARP(q,r) = s.  If q = &lt;223&gt;
and r = &lt;3322332&gt;, then s = &lt;648&gt;.  V(s) = [000101010] can be
partitioned as [@;00;101;01;@] and it is easily verified that V&prime;(s) =
[0+0,1+0+1,0+1] = [021] = V(q).  Changing the generic string to q =
&lt;313&gt; and keeping r = &lt;3322332&gt;, WARP(q,r) = s = &lt;828&gt;; then V(s) =
[010000020] so that, after partitioning V(s) patterned on the
partition of V(r), we have V&prime;(s) = [1+0,0+0+0,0+2] = [102] = V(q).
<p>

<p id="Section4" style="text-align: center"><b>4. Transformation Covariants.</b></p>

<p>[4.1] GENERIC COVARIANCE (G-COV).  The partition-sum vector V&prime; (as
well as U&prime;) represents a covariance with respect to the generic
string; that is, holding the scale string constant, if we vary the
generic string, the relation between V(q) and V(s) based on the
partition pattern of MIC(r) will vary as well, but in a predictable
way (see the example in [3.32]).  The partition pattern is
<i>invariant</i>, making the vector relationships <i>covariant</i>.  For
reference, we will label this phenomenon generic covariance (G-COV).
<p>

[4.2] We now procede to describe two other covariance relations.
G-COV resulted from holding the scale string constant.  We will now
see what happens when the generic string is held constant.
<p>

[4.3] WARPSET generates a one-to-one correspondence between the
circular permutations of the scale string and the specific strings
(see [2.17]).  CHORDSET adds corresponding scale-steps and chords
based on those scale-steps (see [2.24]).  Building on that basic set
of correspondences, we now show that two fundamental relationships,
scale covariance and cover covariance, hold between any WARP-
generated (white note) systems sharing the same scale string.  One
immediately interesting consequence of scale covariance will be the
transport of the &ldquo;common note theorem&rdquo; for transposition from atonal
theory to tonal theory.  Cover covariance will be important in
exploring and extending Riemann systems in Part II.
<p>

[4.4] CORRESPONDENCE.  Let X = WARPSET(q,J) in Ck where J = &lt;1<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>1&gt;
and #(J) = SUM(q) = k.  Obviously X consists of k strings, all of
which are the string q.  Nevertheless, CHORDSET(q,J) = Q based on the
(chromatic) scale E = (0,J) = {0,1,2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>k-1} contains k distinct
subsets, Q = {(0,q),(1,q)<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>(k-1,q)}.  As defined in [2.25], (X,E,Q)
is a white note system.  Now consider Y = WARPSET(q,r) =
{s0,s1,s2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>s(k- 1)} in Ck&prime; (k&prime; &gt; k) also consisting of k strings.
Based on the scale F = (0,r(0)) = {0,p1,p2<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>p(k-1)}, Y generates
CHORDSET(q,r) = R = {(0,s0),(p1,s1)<nobr>, . . . , </nobr>(p(k-1),s(k-1))}.  (Y,F,R) is
also a white note system.  Placing the defining scales E and F in
(cyclical) one-to-one correspondence: 0(=)0, 1(=)p1, 2(=)p2, etc.,
<i>also</i> places the member sets of Q and R in one-to-one correspondence:
(0,q)(=)(0,s0), (1,q)(=)(p1,s1), etc.  The symbol &ldquo;(=)&rdquo; will hereafter
be used to indicate &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; in the above sense between any
parallel lists of elements or strings or sets arranged in some
(circular) sequence and associated with a WARPSET or CHORDSET.
<p>

[4.5] As an example, consider q = &lt;2131&gt; and r = &lt;3322332&gt;.  Each
column of the following table lists sequentially the elements of one
of the sets just discussed; each row is a list of corresponding
elements between sets X, E, Q, Y, F, R.  (Each string and structure
has been named for reference in examples below.)
<p>


<table border>
<tr><td><b>X<td>E<td>Q<td>Y<td>F<td>R</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>2131=q<td>0<td>{0,2,3,6}=0q<td>6282=s<td>0<td>{0,6,8,16} = 0s</td>

<tr><td>2131=q<td>6<td>{6,1,2,5}=6q<td>5373=v<td>16<td>{16,3,6,13}=16v</td>
</table>

<p>

We will write (X,E,Q) (=) (Y,F,R) for an arrangement such as the one
just written.
<p>

[4.6] Given SYS1 = (X,E,Q) in Ck and SYS2 = (Y,F,R) in Ck&prime; as
described in [4.4], the theorems that follow are easily derived by
correspondence.  (NB: We will continue to assume that all scale
strings have a partitioned ic-matrix.  Hence we are giving a weak
form of the theorems here.  Strong covariance theorems would not
require partitioned scale strings and would unnecessarily complicate
the present study.)
<p>

[4.7] SCALE COVARIANCE (S-COV).  If A,B are chords in Q, then there
exist chords C,D in R such that A(=)C, B(=)D, and<p>
<ul>
	#intx(A,B) = SUM(#inty(C,D))
</ul>
<p>
where x is an interval in Ck and y is the set of all possible images
of x in Ck&prime; under WARP(q,r) (i.e., the y-indices corresponding to the
elements of ROWx in MINT(r)).
<p>

[4.8] We are given any two chords A,B in Q, say (from [4.5]), A = 0q =
{0,2,3,6} and B = 5q = {5,0,1,4}.  Setting x = 2 as an example, we
know that #intx(A,B) = 3.  The table in [4.5] indicates that C = 0s =
{0,6,8,16} and D = 13v = {13,0,3,10} correspond to A and B,
respectively.  From the interval map associated with r = &lt;3322332&gt;
(see [3.23]), int2 in C7 maps to int4, int5, or int6 in C18, which
[4.7] tells us to collect and sum.  So SUM(#inty(C,D)) = #int4(C,D) +
#int5(C,D) + #int6 = 1+2+0 = 3 = #intx(A,B).  If SYS2 = (Y,F,R) is
rotated so that C&prime; = 8t&prime; = {8,13,16,6} corresponds to A and D&prime; = 3t =
{3,8,10,0} corresponds to B, then (despite the rotation) once again
SUM(#inty(C&prime;,D&prime;)) = 1+2+0 = 3.
<p>

[4.9] Now suppose that we keep the generic string q = &lt;2131&gt; but use a
different (compatible) scale string, say, r&prime; = &lt;3232323&gt; (note that
MINT(r&prime;) is also partitioned).  We then write out the sets Y&prime;, F&prime;, R&prime;
as we did for SYS1 and SYS2 to reveal SYS3 = (Y&prime;,F&prime;,R&prime;).  Again
setting x = 2 and selecting A and B as in [4.8], we now find that, in
SYS3, C&Prime; = {0,5,8,15) (=) A and D&Prime; = {13,0,3,10} (=) B.  So
SUM(#inty(C&Prime;,D&Prime;) = 0+2+1 = 3 = #intx(A,B) once again.  In general, we
note that, since SYS1 (=) SYS2 (=) SYS3, S-COV holds between SYS2 and
SYS3 whose (non-chromatic) scales are superficially unrelated.  This
example is a demonstration of the following generalization and leads
into the S-COV corollaries.
<p>

[4.10] S-COV holds for any two WARP-generated systems sharing the same
generic string.
<p>

[4.11] Defining x and y as interval classes in Ck and Ck&prime;,
respectively, [4.7] can also be stated<p>
<ul>
	#icx(A,B) = SUM(#icy(C,D))
</ul>
<p>
when A(=)C and B(=)D.
<p>

[4.12] If we collect the icx&rsquo;s in Ck and the icy&rsquo;s in Ck&prime; and display
their multiplicities as ic-vectors, we may also write<p>
<ul>
	V(A,B) = V&prime;(C,D)
</ul>
<p>
when A(=)C and B(=)D.
<p>

[4.13] As an example for [4.12], given SYS1 and SYS2 as before, if we
select chords 3t = {3,8,10,0} and 13v = {13,0,3,10} in R, then
V(3t,13v) = [013030240].  For corresponding chords 1q = {1,3,4,0} and
5q = {5,0,1,4} in Q, [4.12] predicts that V&prime;(3t,13v) = [1+3,0+3+0,2+4]
= [436] = V(1q,5q) which the reader may verify by referring back to
MIC(r) and the ic-map in [3.32].
<p>

[4.14] The special case of [4.7] (for both int- and ic- versions of
S-COV) where x = y = 0 allows us to extend the common tone theorem for
transposition (CTT)<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> from atonal to tonal theory, so #int0(A,B) =
#int0(C,D) or #ic0(A,B) = #ic0(C,D) when A(=)C and B(=)D.
<p>

[4.15] Working through an example again, let us begin with the two
chords A = 1q = {1,3,4,0} and B = 4q = {4,6,0,3} in Q and note that
they have 3 elements (tones) in common.  This can be related to the
ic-vector of q, V(q) = [213].  Since Q = CHORDSET(q,J) is a
&ldquo;chromatic&rdquo; or truly &ldquo;atonal&rdquo; system (there being no privileged string
or scale-step since they are all the same), we may apply the basic
(atonal) CTT and read V(q) as a common tone multipicity pattern.
Thus, since A and B are 3 (chromatic) steps apart, we go to the third
component in V(q) = [213] and see that any two chords with the ic-
vector [213] which are related by T3 (or the mod 7 equivalent T4) have
3 tones in common.  But what is now posited by [4.14] is that when q
is used as a generic with any scale string at all, V(q) is retained as
the common tone pattern for corresponding chords.  Here, since C = 3t
= {3,8,10,0} (=) A and D = 10s = {10,16,0,8} (=) B, we know that C and
D in R must also have 3 elements in common.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup><p>

[4.16] COVERS.  An additional covariance may be observed when the
generic string is held constant, but first we need the following
definition.  If (A,B,C) is a white note system and X is a subset of
chords in C such that every element in B belongs to at least one chord
in X, then X is said to cover the scale B, written: X//B.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup><p>

[4.17] COVER COVARIANCE (C-COV).  Referring again to SYS1 = (X,E,Q)
and SYS2 = (Y,F,R) as defined in [4.4], let K be a subset of chords in
Q and let L be a subset of chords in R such that K(=)L.  Then K covers
E if, and only if, L covers F:<p>
<ul>
	K//E &lt;--&gt; L//f
</ul>
<p>
[4.18] In giving an example of a cover we can also illustrate the idea
of a minimal cover (the least number of chords that can (completely)
cover a scale).<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> In Q (SYS1), any two chords related by T2 (or T5)
have only one element in common, therefore they must form a (minimal)
cover of E.  Selecting 5q and 0q we note that this is indeed the case:
K = 5q.&amp;.0q = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} = E.  C-COV then says that since
13v(=)5q and 0s(=)0q, L = 14w.&amp;.0s = {0,3,6,9,11,14,17} = F.
<p>

[4.19] Obviously any chordset covers its scale (e.g., Q//E and R//F),
but this does not necessarily form a minimal cover.  And, using the
current example, if any <i>two</i> tetrachords in either Q or R have more
than one tone in common, they cannot cover their respective scales.

<hr>

<p>Part I has concentrated almost solely on what we might label an
&ldquo;abstract white note system&rdquo; theory with the aim of collecting,
generalizing and extending certain related developments in the scale
and pc-set theory literature within the recent past.  The examples we
have used have thus been aimed at illustrating the principles
immediately involved, and we have purposely avoided any directed
&ldquo;application.&rdquo;
<p>

In Part II this approach will change considerably.  After briefly
translating John Clough and Jack Douthett&rsquo;s &ldquo;maximally even&rdquo; sets into
string notation, we will begin by framing the &ldquo;usual diatonic&rdquo; as a
model WARP system.  The result will then be generalized to other
(hyper)diatonic systems, beginning with a WARP system in quarter-tone
space.  Utilizing cover covariance, we will then examine David Lewin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Riemann systems&rdquo; and generalize these to the hyperdiatonic systems we
have developed.  Utilizing int-matrices we will also expand Eytan
Agmon&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;efficient linear transformations&rdquo; as it applies to
these systems.  Together, the Lewin and Agmon generalizations will
show that our hyperdiatonic systems display many of the deep
attributes we have come to associate with the historic diatonic.
<p>

Finally, based on our findings in both parts, we will briefly present
a (hypothetical) fourth-order hyperdiatonic system which displays
some unusual (but potentially useful) musical attributes.  Thus Part
II, and the article, will end with one possible response to the
challenge implied by John Clough and Gerald Myerson when they wrote,
&rdquo;We believe that our theory also has considerable potential for
application in the composition of microtonal music.&rdquo;</p>

intervals when the set is in &ldquo;close&rdquo; position has a history that
stretches back at least 80 years.  The better known references to this
practice are Richard Chrisman, &ldquo;Describing Structural Aspects of
Pitch-Sets Using Successive-Interval Arrays,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i>
21:1 (spring 1977) and Eric Regener, &ldquo;On Allen Forte&rsquo;s Theory of
Chords,&rdquo; <i>Perspectives of New Music</i> 13:1 (1974).  Also, Robert Morris
uses &ldquo;interval succession&rdquo; in <i>Composition With Pitch-Classes: A
Theory of Compositional Design</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press,
1987).  In <i>The Harmonic Materials of Twentieth-Century Music</i> (New
York: Appleton- Century-Crofts, 1960) Howard Hanson employs
&ldquo;intervallic order&rdquo; throughout to accompany his version of ic vectors.

Cohn in private correspondence) can be found in Ernst Lecher Bacon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Our Musical Idiom&rdquo; first published in <i>The Monist</i> 27:1 (October
1917).  Not only does Bacon employ an intervallic string notation, he
uses it to define a chord&rsquo;s normal order and gives what appears to be
a complete list of set classes mod 12.<br><a href="#FN5REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN6">6.</a> David Lewin, <i>Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations</i>

concept.  Suggestion 1: let q = &lt;1123&gt;, q&prime; = &lt;3211&gt;, r = r&prime; =
&lt;1211213&gt;.  Suggestion 2: let q = q&prime; = &lt;1222&gt;, r = &lt;1112132&gt;, r&prime; =
&lt;2312111&gt;.  Suggestion 3: let q = 1123, q&prime; = &lt;3211&gt;, r = &lt;1112132&gt;, r&prime;
= &lt;2312111&gt;.  Note especially the effect produced by &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo;
strings as preparation for the comments in [2.20].<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> To give some indication of what might lie ahead in a general
study of these patterns, consider a seemingly innocent change in this
example&rsquo;s generic string from &lt;1133&gt; to q = &lt;1313&gt;.  The generic
string now has two degrees of transpositional symmetry and two degrees
of inversional symmetry.  If a = &lt;1616&gt; and b = some circular
permutation of &lt;2534&gt;, the pattern of specific strings is:
<pre>
	a-b-b&prime;-a-a-b-b&prime;-a.
</pre>
<p>If we then take rotations of b into account and set b(0) = &lt;2534&gt;,
b(1) = &lt;5342&gt;, etc., we then get
<pre>
	a-b(0)-b(3)&prime;-a-a-b(2)-b(1)&prime;-a.
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, if we rotate the generic to q = &lt;3131&gt;, we pick up all
the other b and b&prime; string rotations, forming a kind of &ldquo;complementary&rdquo;
WARPSET:
<pre>
	a*-a*-b(1)-b(2)&prime;-a*-a*-b(3)-b(0)&prime;,
</pre>
<p>(where a* = &lt;6161&gt;).  Together, the two final patterns include all
possible a and b string forms.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> We assume the reader has some knowledge of &ldquo;interval vectors&rdquo; and
related concepts which, over the past 30 years have made appearances
in a wide variety of forms and contexts.  To trace the history of this
concept would take us too far afield in the present study.  But the
most important connections, especially relating &ldquo;multiplicity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;common tones&rdquo; are brought out by David Lewin in &ldquo;Forte&rsquo;s Interval
Vector, My Interval Function, and Regener&rsquo;s Common-Note Function.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> There is a convergence of ideas here that is worth noting.
First, John Clough and Jack Douthett (&ldquo;Maximally Even Sets,&rdquo; <i>Journal
of Music Theory</i> 35.1&ndash;2: 118) define the multiplicity function
DFUNC(X,k,I) as &ldquo;the numbers of intervals of [chromatic length] k and
[diatonic length] I in the set X.&rdquo;  If the interval string of X is r,
then DFUNC is clearly identical to our &ldquo;substring counting function&rdquo;
since DFUNC(X,k,I) = #(r;I,k) in all cases.  But for the present study
we find it useful to allow all values of #(r;I,k) including zeroes so
as to arrange these values in matrix form.  Second, Robert Morris (op
cit., p.40) defines a cyclic interval succession function CINT which
is related to our &ldquo;substring listing function&rdquo; r;x,y.  An example
should make this relationship clear.  If X = {0,3,5,9} in C12, say,
for m=2 CINTm(X) = (5,6,-5,6) = (a,b,c,d).  X&rsquo;s interval string is
&lt;3243&gt;, so CINTm(X) gives us the y-values and x = m for r;x,y:
<pre>
	{/32/} = r;2,5 = r;m,a
	{/24/,/33/} = r;2,6 = r;m,b = r;m,d
	{/43/} = r;2,-5 = r;2,7 = r;m,c
</pre>
<p>Of course Morris takes CINT in a different direction than ours
leading, in one application, to Stravinsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;rotational arrays&rdquo; (op
cit., p.108).  We mention this here since some readers may want to
remember this connection for future use.  Further investigation and
generalizations of CINT (and other &ldquo;atonal&rdquo; concepts presented by
Morris and others) in connection with &ldquo;topological transformations&rdquo;
may prove fruitful in a future study of &ldquo;hyper-atonal&rdquo; systems
embedded in microtonal spaces.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> At first this may seem like a circuitous path to the obvious, but
we will find increasingly that the matrix form for displaying interval
multiplicities reveals more than the (summary) vector form.  In
Part II, int-matrices will be indispensible in understanding efficient
linear transformation saturation.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> Just as the interval string is a circle, the corresponding
interval multiplicity matrix is a torus.  So when the &ldquo;left edge&rdquo; of
the matrix is reached, the reading is continued at the &ldquo;right edge.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> The set of y&rsquo;s corresponding to non-zero MINT entries for a given
x is Clough and Myerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; of x (op cit.).<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> Jay Rahn, &ldquo;Coordination of Interval Sizes in Seven-Tone

q = &lt;2131&gt; is a string in C7, an odd-sized space, so V(q) = [213]

even-sized space, the last component of V(q) must be doubled to read
it as a common-tone pattern.<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> There is some resonance here with Richard Cohn&rsquo;s concept of

abbreviation TT.</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">#intj(S,T) is identical to David Lewin&rsquo;s interval function IFUNC
which he first posited in &ldquo;Re: Intervallic Relations Between Two
Collections of Notes,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 3.2 (November 1959):
298&ndash;301.</div><div id="fndiv4" class="flyoverdiv">While we are not attempting to &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; these basic
relationships, to understand the distinctions we are making here and
throughout, it may be helpful to review the last section
(&ldquo;Philosophical musings&rdquo;) in David Lewin&rsquo;s classic article &ldquo;Forte&rsquo;s
Interval Vector, My Interval Function, and Regener&rsquo;s Common-Note
Function,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 21:2 (fall 1977) 227ff.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">The idea of characterizing a pc set by listing its contiguous
intervals when the set is in &ldquo;close&rdquo; position has a history that
stretches back at least 80 years.  The better known references to this
practice are Richard Chrisman, &ldquo;Describing Structural Aspects of
Pitch-Sets Using Successive-Interval Arrays,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i>
21:1 (spring 1977) and Eric Regener, &ldquo;On Allen Forte&rsquo;s Theory of
Chords,&rdquo; <i>Perspectives of New Music</i> 13:1 (1974).  Also, Robert Morris
uses &ldquo;interval succession&rdquo; in <i>Composition With Pitch-Classes: A
Theory of Compositional Design</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press,
1987).  In <i>The Harmonic Materials of Twentieth-Century Music</i> (New
York: Appleton- Century-Crofts, 1960) Howard Hanson employs
&ldquo;intervallic order&rdquo; throughout to accompany his version of ic vectors.
But the most fascinating use (pointed out to the author by Richard
Cohn in private correspondence) can be found in Ernst Lecher Bacon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Our Musical Idiom&rdquo; first published in <i>The Monist</i> 27:1 (October
1917).  Not only does Bacon employ an intervallic string notation, he
uses it to define a chord&rsquo;s normal order and gives what appears to be
a complete list of set classes mod 12.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">David Lewin, <i>Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations</i>
(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987): 175ff.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">John Clough and Gerald Myerson, &ldquo;Variety and Multiplicity in
Diatonic Systems,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 29.2 (fall 1985).</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Clough and Myerson (op cit.) refer to this set of specific strings
as &ldquo;species.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv"> In Clough and Myerson (op cit.) this equality appears as
&ldquo;cardinality equals variety.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">The reader is invited to work a few examples to help clarify this
concept.  Suggestion 1: let q = &lt;1123&gt;, q&prime; = &lt;3211&gt;, r = r&prime; =
&lt;1211213&gt;.  Suggestion 2: let q = q&prime; = &lt;1222&gt;, r = &lt;1112132&gt;, r&prime; =
&lt;2312111&gt;.  Suggestion 3: let q = 1123, q&prime; = &lt;3211&gt;, r = &lt;1112132&gt;, r&prime;
= &lt;2312111&gt;.  Note especially the effect produced by &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo;
strings as preparation for the comments in [2.20].</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">To give some indication of what might lie ahead in a general
study of these patterns, consider a seemingly innocent change in this
example&rsquo;s generic string from &lt;1133&gt; to q = &lt;1313&gt;.  The generic
string now has two degrees of transpositional symmetry and two degrees
of inversional symmetry.  If a = &lt;1616&gt; and b = some circular
permutation of &lt;2534&gt;, the pattern of specific strings is:

	a-b-b&prime;-a-a-b-b&prime;-a.

If we then take rotations of b into account and set b(0) = &lt;2534&gt;,
b(1) = &lt;5342&gt;, etc., we then get

	a-b(0)-b(3)&prime;-a-a-b(2)-b(1)&prime;-a.

Furthermore, if we rotate the generic to q = &lt;3131&gt;, we pick up all
the other b and b&prime; string rotations, forming a kind of &ldquo;complementary&rdquo;
WARPSET:

	a*-a*-b(1)-b(2)&prime;-a*-a*-b(3)-b(0)&prime;,

(where a* = &lt;6161&gt;).  Together, the two final patterns include all
possible a and b string forms.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">We assume the reader has some knowledge of &ldquo;interval vectors&rdquo; and
related concepts which, over the past 30 years have made appearances
in a wide variety of forms and contexts.  To trace the history of this
concept would take us too far afield in the present study.  But the
most important connections, especially relating &ldquo;multiplicity&rdquo; and
&ldquo;common tones&rdquo; are brought out by David Lewin in &ldquo;Forte&rsquo;s Interval
Vector, My Interval Function, and Regener&rsquo;s Common-Note Function.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">There is a convergence of ideas here that is worth noting.
First, John Clough and Jack Douthett (&ldquo;Maximally Even Sets,&rdquo; <i>Journal
of Music Theory</i> 35.1&ndash;2: 118) define the multiplicity function
DFUNC(X,k,I) as &ldquo;the numbers of intervals of [chromatic length] k and
[diatonic length] I in the set X.&rdquo;  If the interval string of X is r,
then DFUNC is clearly identical to our &ldquo;substring counting function&rdquo;
since DFUNC(X,k,I) = #(r;I,k) in all cases.  But for the present study
we find it useful to allow all values of #(r;I,k) including zeroes so
as to arrange these values in matrix form.  Second, Robert Morris (op
cit., p.40) defines a cyclic interval succession function CINT which
is related to our &ldquo;substring listing function&rdquo; r;x,y.  An example
should make this relationship clear.  If X = {0,3,5,9} in C12, say,
for m=2 CINTm(X) = (5,6,-5,6) = (a,b,c,d).  X&rsquo;s interval string is
&lt;3243&gt;, so CINTm(X) gives us the y-values and x = m for r;x,y:

	{/32/} = r;2,5 = r;m,a
	{/24/,/33/} = r;2,6 = r;m,b = r;m,d
	{/43/} = r;2,-5 = r;2,7 = r;m,c

Of course Morris takes CINT in a different direction than ours
leading, in one application, to Stravinsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;rotational arrays&rdquo; (op
cit., p.108).  We mention this here since some readers may want to
remember this connection for future use.  Further investigation and
generalizations of CINT (and other &ldquo;atonal&rdquo; concepts presented by
Morris and others) in connection with &ldquo;topological transformations&rdquo;
may prove fruitful in a future study of &ldquo;hyper-atonal&rdquo; systems
embedded in microtonal spaces.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">At first this may seem like a circuitous path to the obvious, but
we will find increasingly that the matrix form for displaying interval
multiplicities reveals more than the (summary) vector form.  In
Part II, int-matrices will be indispensible in understanding efficient
linear transformation saturation.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Just as the interval string is a circle, the corresponding
interval multiplicity matrix is a torus.  So when the &ldquo;left edge&rdquo; of
the matrix is reached, the reading is continued at the &ldquo;right edge.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">The set of y&rsquo;s corresponding to non-zero MINT entries for a given
x is Clough and Myerson&rsquo;s &ldquo;spectrum&rdquo; of x (op cit.).</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Jay Rahn, &ldquo;Coordination of Interval Sizes in Seven-Tone
Collections,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 35:1&ndash;2 (spring&ndash;fall 1991).</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Freedom from ambiguity is what Eytan Agmon terms &ldquo;coherence.&rdquo;
See for example, &ldquo;Coherent Tone Systems: a Study in the Theory of
Diatonicism,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 40.1 (spring 1996).</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">Allen Forte, <i>The Structure of Atonal Music</i> (New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1973).</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">A concise statement of this principle can be found in John Rahn,
<i>Basic Atonal Theory</i> (New York: Schirmer Books, 1980): 107ff.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">Keep in mind that we are working with ic-vectors at this point.
q = &lt;2131&gt; is a string in C7, an odd-sized space, so V(q) = [213]
accurately reflects the common tone pattern; but if q was from an
even-sized space, the last component of V(q) must be doubled to read
it as a common-tone pattern.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">There is some resonance here with Richard Cohn&rsquo;s concept of
&ldquo;transpositional combination&rdquo; whereby pc sets are constructed by
combining two or more transpositionally related subsets
(&ldquo;Transpositional Combination in Twentieth Century Music,&rdquo;
Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Rochester, 1987).  In Part II it
will be noted that a &ldquo;Riemann cover&rdquo; is in effect one possible
generalization of Cohn&rsquo;s idea to microtonal spaces.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">G. Mazzola has developed the idea of &ldquo;partial&rdquo; covers, what he
terms &ldquo;minimal cadence sets,&rdquo; an interesting special case of the
concept of covering a scale.  His work is described in Daniel
Muzzulini, &ldquo;Musical Modulation by Symmetries,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music
Theory</i> 39.2 (fall 1995).</div>
