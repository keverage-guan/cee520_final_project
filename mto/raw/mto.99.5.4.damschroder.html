<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] As a young student I often explored the music stacks of my
college library. Small though its book collection was, I
discovered there an astonishing world of information&mdash;a panoply
of routes for my future development as a musician. A heavy,
peculiarly wide, dark blue volume called <i>Counterpoint in Composition</i> intrigued me particularly. Though much that it
contained was familiar, in its final chapter it seemed to go
berserk: solid and dotted beams connected long spans of notes,
some noteheads lacked stems altogether, and Roman numerals
appeared with alarming infrequency. I astutely concluded that I
had a lot more to learn, that none of my current mentors could
help me, and that bizarre graphs such as these <i>might</i> some day
become a focus of my musical life. The younger co-author of that
book was, of course, Carl Schachter. And though others guided my
journey through the foothills of Schenkerian theory, ultimately
Schachter must count as one of my and of every Schenkerian&rsquo;s
mentors, for the scope and brilliance of his writings in that
field have been unmatched, at least since 1935.</p>

<p>[2] Laudably, Schachter has devoted himself to two separate
audiences of readers. With Felix Salzer in <i>Counterpoint in Composition</i> (1969), and with Edward Aldwell in
<i>Harmony and
Voice Leading</i> (1978), he has endeavored to provide the best
possible guidance and insight for the larger community of
musicians in the inaugural phase of their theoretical study. And,
in a steady stream of well-crafted essays spanning several
decades, he has made generous offerings of his knowledge and
skill for the community of scholars and teachers who pursue the
Schenkerian perspective. It is this latter community to whom
Oxford University Press&rsquo;s compendium, <i>Unfoldings: Essays in
Schenkerian Theory and Analysis</i> (edited by Joseph N. Straus), is
directed.</p>

<p>[3] Straus has arranged the essays in four categories: Rhythm and
Linear Analysis (the three celebrated <i>Music Forum</i> articles),
Schenkerian Theory (&ldquo;Either/Or,&rdquo; &ldquo;Analysis by Key: Another Look
at Modulation,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Triad as Place and Action,&rdquo; and a review of
Oster&rsquo;s translation of <i>Free Composition</i>), Words and Music
(samplings from Schubert and Mozart), and Analytical Monographs
(a Bach fugue and Chopin&rsquo;s <i>Fantasy</i>, Op. 49). And there is a
stimulating bonus: the book begins with a wide-ranging dialogue
between editor and author. A list of Schachter&rsquo;s publications and
an index conclude the volume. Since many of the essays were
originally published during the 1970s or 1980s and may be
difficult to obtain in their original incarnation, this
undertaking is most welcome.</p>

<p>[4] For those not acquainted with Schenker&rsquo;s method, this volume
is not a very good place to start. Assumptions regarding
terminology and notation would make for frustrating reading. For
those with some experience, however, these essays are among the
most rewarding material one could study beyond Schenker&rsquo;s own
writings. A few of the essays might enhance a beginner&rsquo;s course,
but most are for more mature practitioners.</p>

<p>[5] I am not inclined to use this space for airing perceived
faults with Schachter&rsquo;s graphs or arguments. Any analyst of
Schachter&rsquo;s stature will do things which make other analysts
scratch their heads, though in this case the increased blood
supply around the brain might lead one to realize that Schachter
is probably right. Instead I would like to explore the essence of
Schachter&rsquo;s particular gift as a thinker and writer by annotating
a few striking sentences from among the essays in the compendium.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;One can be pretty sure that giraffes did not become
plentiful in the zoological gardens of China&rdquo; (pages 192&ndash;193)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[6]
Schachter is fascinating to read, not only because he raises his
readers to a most stimulating intellectual plane, but also
because he is so elegant and humane. Here he is arguing subtly
against the view of some unnamed analysts who reject the notion
of fundamental lines descending from scale degree 5. He compares
such analysts to a Chinese emperor who, upon encountering a
giraffe, mandates: &ldquo;It ought not to exist!&rdquo; But if the emperor
will take a good look at nature&mdash;or if such analysts will take a
good look at the repertoire&mdash;it will be observed that, in fact,
such creatures do exist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;Learning to analyze means learning to hear in depth; a good
analysis is always verifiable by the educated ear.&rdquo; (page 19)&nbsp;</p>

<p> &ldquo;If
the analysis has been successful it leads to hearing that is
incomparably clearer and more comprehensive than it had been
before; it never leads to abstraction without sensory content.&rdquo;
(page 35)&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[7] Receptivity to musical expression is not simply an innate talent.
One&rsquo;s capacity for making sense of music can be augmented through
study. For a few, the starting point of natural talent may be set
very high. But for most people, even most people who devote their
lives to the pursuit of music, developing an &ldquo;educated ear&rdquo; is a
lifelong process. Every word that Schachter writes is intended to
foster that endeavor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;I do not wish to draw out the subject of duration to
unendurable lengths&rdquo; (page 28)&nbsp;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Of course the name
itself&mdash;&lsquo;Luise&rsquo;&mdash;sounds more like whispering leaves and water than,
say, &lsquo;Katinka&rsquo; would.&rdquo; (page 211)&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[8] How refreshing to read an analyst with a twinkle in his eyes!</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;If the ideas elaborated in this article and the analyses
that illustrate them reveal anything significant about musical
rhythm and meter, they are testimony to the continuing creative
force that emanates from the work of our greatest music theorist,
Heinrich Schenker.&rdquo; (page 116)&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[9] Humility is an attribute not necessarily associated with
Schenkerians. Yet when reading Schachter, Schachter begins to
disappear. It is the composer&rsquo;s world&mdash;and the interface between
that world and Schenker&rsquo;s perspective&mdash;that we inhabit. Even
when, as here, Schachter is expanding that perspective in new
ways, it is the original theory&mdash;and its continuity with
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century practice&mdash;that shines through.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;I doubt that this symmetry is accidental, though I can&rsquo;t
prove that it is not.&rdquo; (page 61)</p>

<p>&ldquo;An irreducible residue of
personal opinion remains in any metrical analysis of a piece
which<nobr> . . . </nobr>lends itself to more than one plausible
interpretation.&rdquo; (page 101)&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[10] Schachter accepts that the analytical enterprise is speculative,
and despite the uncanny precision of his presentations, he
acknowledges that there are unknowable elements. After all,
Schenkerian analysis addresses issues that were never articulated
in words or symbols during the period of composition. Schachter
hopes to persuade his readers that certain ways of thinking about
a piece are more insightful than other ways. Yet there are limits
concerning what can be accomplished.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;[Anticipating <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>s] are hardly ever mentioned in theory
books.&ldquo; Footnote: &ldquo;But see Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter, <i>Harmony and Voice
Leading</i>.&rdquo; (pages 73 and 78)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[11] Like Schenker, Schachter can express exasperation concerning
standard textbooks. Unlike Schenker, he has contributed
significantly towards a solution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;The performer must take care to project measures 29&ndash;30 as
an upbeat to the II<sup>6</sup> in measure 31.&rdquo; (page 74)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[12] Those who perform music and those who speculate about it
generally pursue quite different regimens of training. Given the
colossal and ever-increasing pressures within both fields, it
might seem foolish to hope that many would devote significant
energies to an auxiliary agenda, particularly one as daunting as
Schenkerian analysis. Nevertheless Schachter expects that
performers will be among his readers. Because performed art
requires continual re-creation, a class of practitioners who can
make sense of what music notation implies must thrive. Music
analysis&mdash;especially Schenkerian analysis and, here, Schachter&rsquo;s
metric enhancement&mdash;is the systematic study of those
implications. Every performer is the potential recipient of
Schachter&rsquo;s insights. Though many performers never develop a
sophistication in music theory that would allow them to ponder
their art at the level of these essays, those who do will find in
Schachter an enthusiastic ally.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;For many reasons, I find it difficult to contemplate this
song for the keyboard [Chopin, Prelude in E Minor] without
attributing to it a programmatic character&mdash;I hear it as a vision
of death, perhaps the imagination of one&rsquo;s own death.<nobr> . . . </nobr>
Needless to say, I don&rsquo;t require anybody&mdash;not even my
students&mdash;to believe in this program, but I find that many people
do seem to have an emotional reaction to the piece that would be
compatible with its being strongly tinged with grief, mourning,
and the thought of death.&rdquo; (pages 163, 165)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[13] On a superficial level, Schenker&rsquo;s procedures may seem to reduce
meaning out of a musical work. Schachter knows that that is not
the case, and with characteristic eloquence he ponders musical
meaning and, through the medium of analysis, offers insights into
the means by which a composer imbues a work with a specific
sentiment.</p>

<blockquote>

<p> &ldquo;Viewed purely as a &lsquo;theoretical&rsquo; work, <i>Der freie Satz</i>
falls short of <i>Kontrapunkt</i> in comprehensiveness, consistency,
and elegance.&rdquo; (page 185)&nbsp;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why Schenker includes all
of the levels beyond the first in Part III [of <i>Der freie Satz</i>],
but I believe that it is because these levels (as he describes
them) can contain prolongational events characteristic of the
foreground as well as those &lsquo;transferred&rsquo; from the background and
the first level of middleground.&rdquo; (page 186)</p>

<p>&ldquo;This position has
occasioned a good deal of misunderstanding, probably because
Schenker&rsquo;s explanations are inadequate and confusing.&rdquo; (page 201)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>[14] Schachter understands Schenker&rsquo;s theory as few others do. He
knows the writings intimately, in both German and English. He has
pondered the various nuances of change that occurred in
Schenker&rsquo;s thought over the course of his career, and is
sensitive to lingering difficulties. This comprehensive immersion
by one great mind in the work of another gives a special
authority. Schachter can be critical without seeming negative. He
can offer hunches that ring true. In the midst of a contemporary
culture that glamorizes the newfangled, Schachter has pursued
with steadfast devotion an inherited perspective, one which,
through his own contributions, has continued to evolve
dynamically.</p>

<p>[15] Though the eleven essays in <i>Unfoldings</i> reveal only a part
of Schachter&rsquo;s contribution to musical thought in the last third
of the twentieth century, this convenient and inviting volume
assures that his impact will persist well into the future. As
long as there are inhabitants of the planet who care about the
musical heritage of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
Schachter will remain a trusted and inspiring mentor.</p>
