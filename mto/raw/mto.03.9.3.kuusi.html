INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
[1] Pitch-class set theory was originally developed to provide a theoretical 
framework for describing pitch organization of post-tonal music. Among important 
pioneers were Milton Babbitt, Allen Forte, and David Lewin. Babbitt applied 
concepts of mathematical set theory to music, and many pitch-class 
set-theoretical concepts are based on Babbitt&rsquo;s ideas. A general theory using 
these concepts was formulated by Forte. Since then, the theory has been 
developed by many researchers.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[2] 
Pitch-class set theory is most often applied to analysis. Instead of the 
analytical application of the theory, this study is focused on one concept of 
the theory, namely, the set-class.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Set-class is an abstract concept: a 
complex of a number of entities sharing certain properties according to which 
they can be classified. As an abstract concept, the set-class is not directly 
observable. Since it is not possible to make perceptual estimations of 
set-classes, these estimations must be done from observable entities (pitch 
sets) representing the set-classes. Every set-class can be represented by an 
infinite number of pitch sets, and the properties of a set-class are always 
present in the pitch sets representing it. Many authors of pitch-class 
set-theory have&mdash;directly or indirectly&mdash;discussed the connection between 
set-classes and the pitch sets derived from them.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
Generally, they state that there is a connection between the set-class and the 
pitch sets derived from it in some circumstances. However, they also state that 
the realization of the pitch sets involves many factors some of which are 
independent from the set-class (factors mentioned by different authors are, for 
example, the arrangement of the pitches as chords or as melodies, the registral 
placement of the pitches, the octave duplications, counter, rhythm, timbre, 
articulation, and dynamics). </p>
<p>
[3] The number of studies on the connection 
between set-classes and perception of pitch sets derived from them is small. 
Most of these studies have analyzed the connection between certain pitch-class 
set-theoretical resemblance models and the perception of closeness or similarity 
between pitch sets. Some of these studies have also analyzed the factors 
involved in the closeness estimations.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Further, Kuusi 
has shown that there is a connection between some factors guiding the 
estimations and the properties of the set-classes. </p>
<h3>
AIM </h3>
<p>
[4] The aim of this study 
was to test the subjects&rsquo; ability to discriminate between selected set-classes. 
In this study, the set-classes were represented by block chords played using 
the piano sound. Each set-class was represented by a number of chords. The idea 
was to test how well the subjects could discriminate chords derived from a 
certain set-class from chords derived from some other set-class and what factors 
other than the set-class identity were guiding the subjects&rsquo; estimations. </p>
<p>
[5] A new testing regime was used. The subjects were played sequences of chords. 
These sequences were formed of five chords: four &lsquo;standard&rsquo; chords from the 
&lsquo;standard&rsquo; set-class forming the context and one &lsquo;deviant&rsquo; chord from the 
&lsquo;deviant&rsquo; set-class. The subjects were asked to rate which chord did not belong 
to the same group as the others. Hence, another aim of the study was to test 
this testing regime. </p>
<h3>
THE SET-CLASSES, THE TEST CHORDS, THE TEST, AND THE SUBJECTS </h3>
<p>
[6] 
As it was possible to test only a rather small number of items, the author first 
decided to use only triad and pentad classes. The  number of triad classes was 
four: 3-1 {0, 1, 2} (the 3-pc chromatic class), 3-2A {0, 1, 3}, 3-8A {0, 2, 6} 
(the set-class from which the dominant seventh chord without the fifth can be 
derived), and 3-11B {0, 4, 7} (the set-class from which the major chord can be 
derived). The number of pentad classes was five: 5-1 {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} (the 5-pc 
chromatic class), 5-4A {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}, 5-33 {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} (the 5-pc 
whole-tone class), 5-34 {0, 2, 4, 6, 9} (the set-class from which the dominant 
ninth chord can be derived), and 5-35 {0, 2, 4, 7, 9} (the pentatonic class). 
</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 1</b>. The Huron consonance values for the set-classes</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="kuusi_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 1 thumbnail" src="kuusi_table1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>
[7] The consonance values for the set-classes were calculated using the Huron 
model of consonance for set-classes (Huron 1994).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> According to the Huron 
values, the most dissonant set-class of the nine set-classes of the study was 
3-1 with value -1.146, and the most consonant one was 3-11B with value 0.740 (see <b>Table 1</b>). 
The other dissonant set-classes were 5-1 (-0.588), 3-2A (-0.472), and 5-4A 
(-0.309), and the other consonant set-classes were 5-35 (0.479) and 5-34 
(0.224). There were two set-classes close to the middle point of the range of 
the values (the middle point was -0.203). These were 3-8A (-0.216) and 5-33 
(-0.169). </p>
<p>
[8] The 
location of set-class 3-8A in the middle of the range of consonance values needs 
closer examination. As stated earlier, the dominant seventh chord without the 
fifth can be derived from set-class 3-8A. The dominant seventh chord is usually 
considered to be a rather consonant chord, at least by musically trained 
subjects, and the absence of the (perfect) fifth does not affect the character 
of the chord. However, the absence of the fifth affects the consonance value: 
the three intervals between the fifth and the other pitches of the dominant 
seventh chord (perfect fifth and two minor thirds) would increase the consonance 
value. Hence, set-class 3-8A will be included in the &lsquo;consonant&rsquo; set-classes.

<p>
[9] Each of the triad classes was represented by two chordal settings. The span 
of the chordal settings varied between 13 and 16 semitones, that is, the 
interval between the lowest and highest pitch varied between the minor ninth and 
the major tenth. Additionally, each chordal setting was played on three to six 
transpositional levels in middle register (between A3 and Eb5). Hence, each 
triad class was represented by seven to twelve chords. The chords derived from 
the triad classes are in <b>Figure 1</b>. </p>
<p>
[10] Three chordal settings with the span of 14 
semitones (the major ninth) were derived from each pentad class. Each chordal 
setting was played on five transpositional levels in middle register (between A3 
and Eb5). Hence, each pentad class was represented by 15 chords. The chords 
derived from the five pentad classes are in <b>Figure 2</b>.</p>
<p>
[11] The properties of the 
set-classes are always present in chords derived from them. Hence, to some 
extent the set-class properties determine the characteristics of the chords 
representing it regardless of the chordal setting. For example, all chords 
derived from set-class 3-11B are always major chords, and chords derived from 
set-class 5-1 have dissonant intervals between the pitches. It seems likely that 
the familiarity of chords derived from set-class 3-11B and the dissonance of 
the chords derived from set-class 5-1 are characteristics guiding aural 
perception of them, but it should be remembered that these characteristics are 
due to the set-class properties. Naturally, the audibility of these 
characteristics can to some extent be enhanced or concealed by aspects of 
chordal setting. A limited number of chord spans and the middle register were 
used in this test in order to diminish the effect of chordal factors (that is, 
factors independent from the set-class). </p>
<p>
[12] The chords were first made using 
the Finale 2000 program. On the program the pitches of each chord were made to 
start and stop in perfect simultaneity by quantifying the note values. In 
addition, each pitch was given the same objective dynamic level. A grand piano 
sound <i>B&ouml;sendorfer</i> from the <i>Nemesys Gigastudio</i> piano sample library was used 
when the chord sounds were played.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>

<p>
[13] There were 42 items in the test. Each item consisted of a sequence of five 
chords played three times. As already stated, in each sequence, four of the five 
chords were derived from the standard set-class and one from the deviant 
set-class. Every triad class was paired with every other triad class and every 
pentad class with every other pentad class, but triad classes were not paired 
with pentad classes. This made altogether 12 triad-class items and 20 
pentad-class items. Additionally, there were ten controls (4 items using triad 
classes and 6 items using pentad classes). All 16 items using triad classes 
(played in random order) were presented first, followed by the 26 items using 
pentad classes (again in random order). The test items are in <b>Figure 3</b>.</p>
<p>
[14] Each chord 
lasted one second and the three sequences  were separated by a two-second 
silence. Hence, one item lasted 3*7 = 21 seconds. Two items were separated by a 
seven-second silence. The whole test lasted approximately 20 minutes. Two items 
can be heard in the sound files <b>Item 1</b> and
<b>Item 2</b>.</p>
<p>
[15] The subjects 
were asked to rate which one of the five chords did not belong to the same group 
as the others. The subjects were not told any principles of the criteria 
according to which they should make their ratings; hence, they were allowed to 
define for themselves their own criteria. During a short practicing session 
before the test, the subjects were able to familiarize themselves with the 
material to be used. The ratings were made on a test form in which numbers from 
1 to 5 represented the five chords of each sequence. The subjects&rsquo; task was 
first to aurally select one chord not belonging to the group and then to circle 
the number representing that particular chord. After the test the subjects 
filled out a questionnaire with questions about their age, sex, music studies, 
and listening habits. </p>
<p>
[16] Eighty-two subjects participated. They were not paid for participating. 
Twenty subjects were rejected because of their poor performance in the control 
chord test. The remaining 62 subjects were divided into four subgroups according 
to their music studies: </p>
<ol>
  <li>music theorists and composers (theorists/composers, N = 14) </li>
  <li>professional musicians or music students (professionals, N = 27) </li>
  <li>subjects who have studied music but not professionally (non-professionals, 
  N = 11) </li>
  <li>subjects who have never studied music (non-musicians N = 10) </li>
</ol>
<p>
[17] The subjects of group 1 (theorists/composers) 
were teachers or professional students from the Department of Composition and 
Music Theory at the Sibelius Academy. Seven of them were female and seven male. 
Their ages varied from 20 to 53 years, the average being 33.21. The total years 
of music studies (both non-professional and professional) varied between 12  and 40 years, and the average was 20.86. They reported that they listen to or 
play or compose post-tonal music from 2 to 43 hours per week (the average was 
7.46 hours). Two of the subjects reported having absolute pitch. </p>
<p>
[18] The 
subjects of group 2 (professionals) were professional musicians or professional 
music students from various departments of the Sibelius Academy. Eight of them 
were female and nineteen male. The average age was 24.44, and the range was from 
18 to 41 years. The average of all music studies (both non-professional and 
professional studies) was 14.96 years, the range being from 10 to 21 years. 
These subjects reported that they listen to or play post-tonal music from 0 to 
32 hours per week, the average being 4.39 hours. The number of subjects with 
absolute pitch was seven. </p>
<p>
[19] The subjects of group 3 (non-professionals) were 
teachers or students from Helsinki University, Department of Psychology. Nine of 
them were female and two male. Their ages varied between 20 and 46 years, the 
average being 28.18. The average time of non-professional music studies was 
11.36 years, the range being from 5 to 20 years. These subjects reported that 
they listen to or play post-tonal music from 0 to 10 hours per week, the average 
being 2.18 hours. The number of subjects with absolute pitch was one. </p>
<p>
[20] The 
subjects of group 4 (non-musicians) were teachers or students from Helsinki 
University, Department of Psychology. Five of them were female and five male. 
Their ages varied from 20 to 42 years, the average being 24.70. They reported 
that they listen to or play post-tonal music from 0 to 5 hours per week (the 
average was 1.00 hour). None of them reported having absolute pitch. </p>
<h3>
RESULTS 
</h3>
<p>
[21] As already stated, there were originally 42 items in the test. However, a 
mistake was discovered in one item when the chords were played to the first 
group of subjects. The item 24 {5-4A, 5-1} was incorrect (it was actually {3-10, 
5-1}), and the subjects&rsquo; ratings of this item were excluded from analyses. 
Hence, the total number of items to be analyzed was 41. </p>
<p>
[22] The total number of 
cases was 2542 (41 items rated by 62 subjects). The total number of cases in 
which no selection was made was 30, hence, very small (1.18%). This can be 
interpreted to indicate that the subjects were motivated to make the test and 
that they were able to operate with the testing regime. </p>

<p>
[23] The connection 
between the pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm and the subjects&rsquo; estimations 
was analyzed first. In total, the deviant chord was selected in 1547 cases, that 
is, in 60.9% of all cases. The averages of ratings in which the subjects 
selected the deviant chord were also calculated separately for each group (see 
<b>Table 2</b>). As can be seen, these averages differed clearly from one group to 
another. The theorists/composers made their ratings most often according to the 
pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm, even though only a few of them were familiar with the paradigm. The professionals made more ratings according to the 
paradigm than the non-professionals, and the non-professionals more than the 
non-musicians. </p>
<p>
[24] The differences between the average 
by theorists/composers and the averages by other groups of subjects were 
statistically very significant (p &lt; .001) in most cases (the value p &lt; .001 
indicates that the result could have occurred by chance in fewer cases than 1 in 
1000). The exceptions of this were the differences between theorists/composers 
and professionals: the averages were 12.64 and 9.93 respectively for the triad 
classes (p &lt; .010), and 19.07 and 17.00 for the pentad classes (this difference 
was not statistically significant, p &gt; .050). Additionally, the differences 
between the averages of non-musicians and the averages of the other subject 
subgroups were statistically very significant (p &lt; .001) in all but two cases: 
the averages of non-professionals and non-musicians were 7.91 and 4.60 for the 
triad classes (p &lt; .010), and 13.82 and 9.07 for the pentad classes (p &lt; .050).

<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 4</b>. The ratings made according to the pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm (Y-axis) plotted against the years of music studies (X-axis)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="kuusi_examples.php?id=5&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 4 thumbnail" src="kuusi_fig4_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>
[25] The results of the first analysis indicated that the subjects were rather 
well able to aurally discriminate chords according to the set-class from which 
the chords were derived. Naturally the aural perception was guided by the 
audible characteristics of the chords (for example, the degree of consonance or 
the familiarity of the chords), but, as already stated, these characteristics 
are due to the set-class properties. Additionally, the results indicated that 
the connection between pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm of set-classes and 
subjects&rsquo; ratings of chords was higher for subjects who were musically highly 
trained than for subjects without musical training. This result was expected and 
reasonable. However, the number of years of music study alone could not explain 
the ratings. This can be seen from the scatter diagram (<b>Figure 4</b>) in which the ratings made according to the pitch-class set-theoretical 
paradigm are plotted against the years of music study. The correlation between 
these ratings and the years of study was 0.57 (p &lt; .001), indicating that the 
years of study explained the ratings only to some extent. The scatter diagram 
shows that the type of musical studies is important as well. </p>
<p>
[26] In the questionnaire the subjects 
were asked how many hours per week they listen to or play post-tonal music. Even 
though this kind of question cannot be considered a very exact one, it was 
hypothesized that there might be some connection between the ratings and the 
familiarity with the chord material. The correlation was calculated between the reported hours and the ratings made according to the pitch-class set-theoretical 
paradigm. The correlation was very low (r = 0.26, non-significant), indicating 
that the results of the test cannot be explained by the listening habits. </p>
<p>
[27] 
The second analysis aimed at identifying and categorizing the chordal factors 
that were guiding the subjects when they selected one of the standard chords 
instead of the deviant chord. These factors were connected with chordal setting 
and they were independent of the set-class identity. In this analysis the focus 
was on those chords that were selected by an especially high proportion (25% or 
higher) of subjects. Ten such cases were found. In four of these cases the most 
often selected standard chord was chosen more often than the deviant chord 
(items 4, 11, 16, and 33) and in one case they were selected equally often (item 
25). </p>

<p>
[28] In item 4, chords 1, 2, 3, and 5 were derived from the standard set-class 
3-1, and chord 4 was the deviant derived from set-class 3-2A (see <b>Example 1</b> for 
the item). Hence, the whole item consisted of dissonant chords. In this item, 
41.9% of the subjects selected chord 3. It was selected especially by the 
non-professionals, the professionals, and the non-musicians. As can be seen, 
this chord was neither the highest nor the lowest one. Yet it was the only chord 
of this item with a small interval (the major second) between the two highest 
pitches; the other chords had a small interval (the major second in the standard 
chords and the minor third in the deviant chord) between the two lowest pitches. 
Hence, the difference in the arrangement of the pitches seemed to affect the 
ratings. When the same item was played again as a control (item 14), similar 
ratings were made: altogether 37.1% of the subjects selected chord 3. This time 
this chord was selected especially by the non-professionals and the 
professionals. </p>

<p>
[29] In item 7, chords 1, 3, 4, and 5 were derived from the standard set-class 
3-8A, and chord 2 from the deviant set-class 3-1 (see <b>Example 2</b>). As stated 
earlier, the dominant seventh chord without the fifth can be derived from 
set-class 3-8A, and the chords can be considered consonant. And as can be seen, 
this chord was twice in root position (chords 1 and 4) in this item. When 
ratings were made of item 7, 29.0% of the subjects selected chord 1, the higher 
one of the two chords in root position. Interestingly, chord 4 was selected by 
0% of the subjects. Chord 1 was selected most often by the non-musicians. When 
this item was played again as a control (item 15), 21% of all subjects selected 
chord 1 and 0% chord 4. Again chord 1 was selected most often by the 
non-musicians. </p>


<p>
[30] In item 11and its control item 16, the standard chords were 1, 2, 4, and 5 
(derived from set-class 3-2A) and the deviant chord was 3 (set-class 3-1). 
Hence, the set-classes were the same as those in items 4 and 14 (see above), and 
all chords of these items were dissonant. The chords of items 11 and 16 are in 
<b>Example 3</b>. As can be seen, chord 1 and chord 5 were similar chordal settings on 
different transpositional levels, and so were chords 2 and 4. When ratings were 
made of these items, the lower one of the two similar chordal settings was 
selected more often that the higher one: chord 5 was selected more often than 
chord 1, and chord 4 was selected more often than chord 2. </p>

<p>
[31] In item 25 and its control item 42, the standard chords were 1, 2, 3, and 5 
and they were derived from set-class 5-35. Hence, the context was rather 
consonant. The deviant chord was number 4 and it was derived from set-class 
5-33. The chords are in <b>Example 4</b>. When the subjects made their ratings, 40.3% 
of them selected chord 5 in item 25 and 32.3% of them in item 42. As can be 
seen, chord 5 was the highest in register. There were subjects from all 
subgroups, the fewest being theorists/composers and the most being 
non-professionals and non-musicians. </p>

<p>
[32] In item 29 and its control item 38, the standard set-class was 5-34 and the 
chords derived from it were 2, 3, 4, and 5. Hence, the context was rather 
consonant. The deviant set-class was 5-33, and the deviant chord was number 1 
(see the chords in <b>Example 5</b>). As can be seen, the dominant ninth chord was in 
root position twice in these items (chords 3 and 4). In both cases chord 3, the 
higher one of the root-position chords, was selected by 25.8% of the subjects. 
There were subjects from all subgroups, yet this chord was most often selected 
by the professionals and least often by the non-musicians. Chord 4 (the lower of 
the root-position chords) was selected by 11.3% of the subjects in item 29 and 
by 12.9% of the subjects in item 38. Those who selected chord 4 were most often 
non-professionals and non-musicians. </p>

<p>
[33] In item 33, the set-classes were 5-35 (standard) and 5-34 (deviant), and 
the whole item was rather consonant. The standard chords were 1, 2, 3, and 4, 
and the deviant chord was number 5. The chords are in <b>Example 6</b>. As can be seen, 
two of the standard chords had the major chord formed of the three lowest 
pitches (chords 1 and 4). Of the standard chords, the highest chord (chord 2) 
was selected by 30.7% of the subjects, especially by the theorists/composers and 
the professionals. Chord 4, which was the higher one of the two having the major 
chord, was selected by 21% of the subjects, most often by the professionals. 
Hence, it seems that within this item, both the register and the arrangement of 
pitches were factors guiding the ratings. </p>

<h3>
CONCLUSIONS </h3>
<p>
[34] The study has 
examined the subjects&rsquo; ability to categorize chords according to their set-class 
identity. Additionally, the study has examined the importance of chordal factors 
for the categorization. In the test the subjects were played a five-chord 
sequence successively three times and they were asked which chord does not 
belong to the same group as the other chords. It seemed to be rather easy for 
the subjects to make their ratings in this new testing regime. </p>
<p>
[35] The test was 
made in pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm. In each five-chord sequence, the 
four standard chords were derived from the standard set-class and the deviant 
chord from the deviant set-class. It was found that in approximately 61% of all 
cases the subjects selected the deviant chord; hence, they made their ratings 
according to the pitch-class set-theoretical paradigm. Additionally, a clear 
connection was found between the years and the type of music study and the 
number of ratings made according to the paradigm. The highly trained subjects 
from the Department of Composition and Music Theory from the Sibelius Academy 
made their ratings most often according to the paradigm, even though only a few 
of them were familiar with pitch-class set theory. The subjects with no music 
study made their ratings most often according to factors other than those 
connected with set-class identity. These other factors were chordal: the 
register and the chordal setting of the chords. </p>
<p>
[36] The analyses of the cases 
in which one of the standard chords was selected instead of the deviant chord 
revealed some tendencies. First, the register of the chord seemed to affect 
the ratings. If the context was consonant or rather consonant, the subjects 
tended to select the highest chord. But if the context was dissonant, they 
tended to select the lowest chord. There were altogether 20 cases in the test in 
which this tendency could be seen, but only two cases with the opposite 
tendency. Second, certain aspects of chordal setting seemed also to guide the 
subjects. These were the placement of a small interval (in triads), and the 
arrangement of the pitches so that they formed the root position of a familiar 
tonal chord (both in triads and pentads). Altogether ten cases were found in 
which these kind of chordal aspects seemed to guide the subjects&rsquo; estimations, 
while the opposite was found in only one case. </p>
<p>
[37] The results of this study 
showed that the estimations of chords are based on a number of simultaneous 
factors. Set-class identity seems to be one of them, the other ones being chordal. The factors revealed in this study were closely related to those revealed 
in earlier studies as well (7). This was the case even though the earlier 
studies have used totally different kinds of testing regimes and even though 
only some of the earlier studies have used pentachords.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[38] The present 
study has evoked need for additional study. The new testing regime used in the 
study needs to be tested using other set-classes. The relative importance of 
set-class identity and the relative importance of chordal factors should be 
examined in varying set-class and chord contexts. The finding that the subjects 
tend to select the highest chord in a consonant context and the lowest chord in 
a dissonant context is worth further examination.</p>
