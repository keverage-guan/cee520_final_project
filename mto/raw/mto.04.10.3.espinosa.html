<p><blockquote>
  <br>Stones, wood, and lime do not constitute a building, no matter how good 
  they are in and of themselves. They must be joined together and connected in a 
  certain manner if they are to make a house.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>[1] Fantasias have been part of the western music tradition for centuries, 
but have proven problematic since their inception. Writers struggle to 
characterize works within the genre; they are conflicted between describing 
fantasias as the most wondrous pieces and faulting them for an apparent lack of 
formal coherence. Though many leading composers&mdash;including C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, 
Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann&mdash;wrote fantasias, they have been 
marginalized in terms of repertory and scholarship. Nevertheless, <i>Fantasie</i> 
elements, which incongruously wormed their way into more formal genres such as 
the sonata, were among the most essential compositional components, prized by 
composers and audiences alike.</p>
<p>[2] Many noted scholars have ventured to explain these enigmatic pieces. In the 
eighteenth century Charles Burney catalogued the prodigious improvisatory 
ability of C.P.E. Bach on the clavichord and provided an account of what late 
eighteenth-century improvisation looked and sounded like.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> C.P.E. Bach wrote 
about the fantasia and <i>fantasie</i> procedures in the <i>Versuch.</i><sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The 
eighteenth-century theorists Sulzer and Koch devised ways of dealing with the 
compositional process involved in creating this music.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> In the early part of 
the 20th century, Schenker analyzed fantasias by C.P.E. Bach.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> More recently 
Charles Rosen, Leonard Ratner, and Joel Lester have provided models for 
understanding late eighteenth-century music.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Mark Evan Bonds and Elaine 
Sisman have added to the scholarship, incorporating rhetoric and musical wit.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
The central issue raised by these accounts is whether we can derive meaning from 
the fantasia&mdash;a genre that often seems to lack formal procedures. More 
generally, this gets at the problem of finding meaning in instrumental music.</p>
<p>[3] To better understand fantasias, scholars have employed various metaphors to 
help delineate structure. A conventional form not only drives perception and 
expectation, it promotes coherence. Authors like Bonds have claimed that 
rhetoric served as the model for eighteenth-century musical composition. In my 
own work on C.P.E. Bach, I claim that for his fantasias this archetype was 
indeed the rhetorical model. Depending on the listener&rsquo;s familiarity with the 
rhetorical model, C.P.E. Bach could play with the audience&rsquo;s expectations to 
heighten their sense of drama. The fantasia and eighteenth-century music in 
general are poetic: &ldquo;&lsquo;you do not alter the words of the language, they remain 
always the same; what counts is the manner in which you put them together!&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s affective musical discourses involved many contrasting rhetorical 
materials such as exclamation, interjection, suspension, interruption, 
affirmation, and negation. Through the dramatic use of these semiotic guides, 
situating them within the framework of the rhetorical model, as well as 
associating these ideas with congruent key affects, C.P.E. Bach produced 
organized, coherent, musical arguments that were imbued with content and 
effected communication.</p>
<p>[4] Annette Richards proposes a radical new way of modeling the fantasia, 
grounded in the contemporary aesthetics of <i>Gartenkunst</i> and the picturesque. The 
picturesque [technically] </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>encompasses and encourages fragmentation and disruption, contrast and variety, 
and problematizes the limits of form and conventional expectation; in modern 
music criticism, however, the term has generally been taken colloquially to 
describe quaint or pastoral associations or obvious pictorialism. (page 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richards claims that eighteenth-century critics from many different disciplines 
derived their particular artistic observations from landscape gardening.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The new garden ideal drew on the irregularities of natural landscape, with its 
woods, rocks and rugged waterfalls&mdash;a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; aesthetic <nobr>. . .</nobr> called for contrast, 
surprises and partial concealments in garden art, as opposed to the predictable 
regularities and symmetrical patterns of the old formal garden. (page 9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the landscape garden, fantasias tenuously balance between the extremes of 
the beautiful and the sublime. They idle between underlying coherence and 
surface disruption. Richards points out that though central to contemporary 
musical conceptions, the influence of the picturesque aesthetic has been 
overlooked in recent scholarship on eighteenth-century music.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Predicated on a dialectical engagement with the natural and the artificial, and 
its predilection for irregularity, unruly freedom and ambiguous borders, the 
picturesque was, and is, an important tool for the conceptualization of 
contemporary instrumental music, and especially that period&rsquo;s most ambiguous 
genre, the free fantasia. (page 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking through the lens of the picturesque aesthetic allows for a new way of 
listening to the fantasia and understanding its peculiarities through precisely 
the startling and disruptive elements that have baffled critics.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Resituating the fantasia within a broader, more picturesque, conception of the 
eighteenth-century musical imagination offers the present-day performer and 
listener the opportunity for a new and lively engagement with this music which, 
in its resistance to notation and its intrinsic instability might offer us&mdash;as 
it offered educated listeners of the period&mdash;an unruly and rewarding way to 
hear anew even the more &lsquo;ordered&rsquo; masterpieces of the late eighteenth-century 
canon. (page 100)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[5] Richards&rsquo; study focuses primarily on the fantasias of C.P.E. Bach and also 
deals with the fantasias and <i>fantasie</i> procedures of works by Haydn and 
Beethoven. She recreates the picturesque aesthetic for the late 
eighteenth-century fantasia through a rigorous and well-documented historical 
account, showing its derivation from landscape gardening. She cites an abundance 
of contemporary appearances of the veiled Isis (a symbol of Nature concealed, 
often included in art, monuments, the frontispieces of books, etc.), and 
establishes that much of the contemporary criticism incorporated metaphors 
articulated through picturesque vocabulary.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A straight road is the most agreeable, because it shortens the journey. But in 
an embellished field, a straight walk has an air of formality and confinement; 
and at any rate is less agreeable than a winding or waving walk; for in 
surveying the beauties of an ornamented field, we love to roam from place to 
place at freedom. Winding walks have another advantage: at every step they open 
new views. In short, the walks in a pleasure ground ought not to have the 
appearance of a road: my intention is not to make a journey, but to feast my eye 
on the beauties of art and nature. (page 63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fantasia, like the picturesque garden, is confined (i.e. uses borders and 
margins), but the confinement is deliberately concealed&mdash;an artfully 
constructed illusion. Both the landscaped garden and the fantasia are art forms 
of constant retrospection and reevaluation from different vantage points and 
levels of distance.</p>
<p>[6] Richards engages contrasting contemporary aesthetic viewpoints. Carl 
Friedrich Cramer characterized the fantasia with the term, <i>Aussichten,</i> or 
organization from afar of multiple glimpses from different angles. In <i>Allgemeine 
Theorie,</i> Sulzer argued for a &lsquo;unified whole out of Nature&rsquo;s diversity and 
multiplicity,&rsquo; for both music and <i>Gartenkunst</i>&mdash;a theoretical model for the
<i>Originalgenie.</i> Conversely, the aesthetic theories of Johann Friedrich Reichardt 
discouraged sudden disjunctions and extreme mixtures of affect as symptomatic of 
empty virtuosity. Though he praised Haydn&rsquo;s and C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s music as radical 
transformations in musical thought, these composers could get away with such 
fanciful compositions only because of their supreme genius and artful handling 
of disparate musical elements. Richards brings in critical writings on 
contemporary painting in order to assemble a more general aesthetic of the 
picturesque that subsumed all of the arts. She invokes the contemporary 
philosophy of Kant, who claimed that landscape gardening is more closely related 
to the fantasia than to painting because it is experienced gradually through 
time, unlike a painting which is static.</p>
<p>[7] What appeared so irregular for the fantasia was its fundamental independence 
of usual thematic process, harmonic plan, or rhythmic structure. The fantasia 
relied on a variety of thematic ideas rather than the manipulation and 
development of a single theme. However, Schenker, in &lsquo;The Art of Improvisation&rsquo; 
commented that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>we see that Bach persists in the most precise orderliness even in the diminution 
of a free fantasia, and he conceals this orderliness purely for the sake of the 
fantasia under the guise of disorder; it is precisely this which constitutes the 
inimitable of his art. (page 42)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Eb major (H. 277) and A major (H. 278) fantasias from C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Kenner 
und Liebhaber</i> collections incorporate a wealth of seemingly unrelated ideas and 
quick, disorienting modulations that often utilize the fully diminished seventh 
chord. Each one is based on a governing tripartite structure of unmeasured outer 
sections contrasted with a measured, dance-like middle section. Both of these 
fantasias end with a reprise of the opening material. Musical fragments are 
reused, reorganized, and reharmonized, which calls into question what is 
spontaneous and what is composed, or what is concealed. There is a balance 
between coherence and incoherence in these pieces. The continuous recasting of 
musical fragments suggests an active engagement by both composer and listener 
alike, where musical materials in the present are interpreted and reinterpreted 
in light of what has come before. &lsquo;Though there is madness, yet there&rsquo;s method 
in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>[8] Richards claims that the picturesque qualities of music&mdash;the fantastic and 
unexpected&mdash;draw our attention to the conscious act of listening. The fantasia 
is an active process for both the composer/performer and the listener. Thus, the 
fantasia demands informed and interpretive listening on the part of the 
audience. An important element of this aesthetic is silence, which often creates 
fragmentation and unpredictability. Silence demands interpretation on the part 
of the listener, and reinterpretation once the music resumes. Richards&rsquo; 
insightful analyses of the C.P.E. Bach fantasias illustrate how Bach engaged in 
flights of fancy after abrupt silences, playing on listener expectations. At 
these moments we find a &lsquo;dialogic engagement between performer and listener,&rsquo; 
(page 98) an important turning point in musical aesthetics: imaginative listening. 
Richards cites Cramer and his metaphor of the cloudscape&mdash;the fantasia latent 
with potential meanings. Cramer valued the &lsquo;contingent and the disruptive as 
opportunities for imaginative play by the listener,&rsquo; meaningful despite its 
apparent incoherence (page 100). Here the interpretive ambiguity is an asset, and 
an obvious link to emerging Romantic aesthetics.</p>
<p>[9] Richards claims that C.P.E. Bach was well versed in the aesthetics of 
landscape gardening and provides evidence that Bach enjoyed revealing the hidden 
structure of the Potsdam gardens to his friends. More significantly, she claims 
that C.P.E. Bach was an integral member of the intellectual circles of Hamburg 
that were responsible for disseminating the aesthetics of sentimentality and 
humor.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, the picturesque elevated the comic to new heights, with important 
ramifications for the reception of German instrumental music towards the end of 
the eighteenth century. It was precisely the complex amalgam of sublimity and 
comedy in Haydn&rsquo;s music of the 1790s that appealed to his London audiences (page 
143).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[10] Richards also raises issues between the public and private spheres of 
music. She claims that C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s music is evocative because it balances both 
<i>empfindsamkeit</i> (sentiment) and <i>einsamkeit</i> (solitude). She cites Johann Georg 
Zimmermann&rsquo;s notion that solitude is necessary not just for self-expression, but 
also for self-examination, resulting in higher self-awareness by throwing off 
the chains of convention. She ties in the picturesque aesthetic, where &lsquo;the 
English garden stood as the central metaphor in North German culture for the 
mediation between the private and public spheres&rsquo; (page 171). Thus the landscape 
garden becomes a public space where one has imaginative freedom.</p>
<p>[11] Richards problematizes the tension, claiming that C.P.E. Bach made &lsquo;many 
compromises in providing music for general consumption, and that in only a small 
number of pieces written for himself had he been able to be truly free&rsquo; (page 
175). However, &lsquo;fantasias were difficult, uncompromising and private, and Bach&rsquo;s 
statements emphasize solitary performance and understanding of this music over 
its public reception, while hinting at the contradictions inherent in its 
commodification&rsquo; (page 175). Significantly, C.P.E. Bach arranged his final 
fantasia&mdash;<i>C.P.E. Bachs Empfindungen</i>&mdash;for clavichord and accompanying violin, 
with overt allusions and concessions to the accompanied violin sonata, the most 
fashionable genre of the day. Richards argues that C.P.E. Bach created an ironic 
commentary on the most public of genres being accompanied by the most private of 
genres. It is in examples of this sort that Richards masterfully elucidates 
C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s musical wit&mdash;thumbing his nose at the conventions of the day by 
artfully employing them.</p>
<p>[12] Like C.P.E. Bach and Haydn, Beethoven loved to walk in the Viennese gardens 
and knew well the contrasting French and English aesthetics of landscape 
gardening. Moreover, Czerny referred to the picturesque as a metaphor for the 
dialectic between freedom and formal coherence in Beethoven&rsquo;s sonatas. Under 
Richards&rsquo; model, the &lsquo;oddities&rsquo; of Beethoven&rsquo;s <i>quasi un fantasia</i> sonatas can be 
&lsquo;explained&rsquo; as fantastical elements infiltrating conventional sonata procedures.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The winding paths of a landscape garden that appear to mislead are part of a 
coherent and inexorable, if mysterious, programme. Likewise, the moments of 
obscurity and bafflement in a sonata by Beethoven are central to the experience 
of the work and to its overall plan (page 212).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She analyzes Sonata Op. 101, where &lsquo;sudden dislocation and erring attention 
threaten to negate the forward drive that underlies the teleology of form&rsquo; (page 
206). <i>Fantasie</i> elements threaten to tear the sonata form asunder. In an 1815
<i>AmZ </i>article, Amadeus Wendt attests to the problem of coherence in Beethoven&rsquo;s 
sonatas caused by fantasia interruptions. There is a tension between pleasure 
and rationality, where the fantasia is both &lsquo;potentially marvelous&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;potentially meaningless&rsquo; (page 207). And yet the metaphor of the picturesque ties 
in well with Beethoven&rsquo;s Romantic sensibilities of sudden disruption and 
contrast. &lsquo;The difficult musical patches make the sweet spots even sweeter&rsquo; (page 
190).</p>
<p>[13] Richards&rsquo; picturesque aesthetic proves to be a useful tool to model the 
eighteenth-century fantasia. She rightly characterizes the <i>fantasie</i> aesthetic as 
a process of invention and elaboration. She develops Sulzer&rsquo;s and Koch&rsquo;s ideas 
to describe the fantasia as a compositional <i>process</i> rather than a <i>work</i>. It might 
prove fruitful to question our anachronistic nineteenth-century notions of &lsquo;the 
work,&rsquo; especially when confronted with eighteenth-century pieces that, in many 
respects, defy this notion.</p>
<p>[14] Richards&rsquo; book leaves a few unanswered questions. First, though she deals 
well with the fantasias of C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, and Beethoven, she is silent on 
Mozart&rsquo;s fantasias. Second, Richards&rsquo; study falters in its deference to the 
sonata. Time and time again Richards compares C.P.E. Bach fantasias to our 
conceptions of sonata form and its procedures. A fantasia is not a sonata. 
Shouldn&rsquo;t it be judged on its own merits, not compared and contrasted with a 
markedly different genre? She effectively locates the fantasia as an &lsquo;imperfect 
art&rsquo; in relation to the sonata. Moreover, the teleology of her narrative leads 
the reader, in the final chapters, to Beethoven&rsquo;s late sonatas. I feel as if she 
implies a &lsquo;progress&rsquo; from C.P.E. Bach&rsquo;s &lsquo;less perfect&rsquo; fantasias to Beethoven&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;more perfect&rsquo; sonatas. Finally, affects and the arrangement of an affective 
structure within a piece were central to the eighteenth-century understanding of 
music.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> I think that an account of the discourse on affect and its 
relationship to the aesthetics of the picturesque might enrich Richards&rsquo; 
argument.</p>
<p>[15] In conclusion, Richards&rsquo; metaphor of the picturesque provides a 
historically-based aesthetic method by which we can better understand the music 
of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, especially the music of 
C.P.E. Bach, Haydn, and Beethoven. Moreover, it complements the research done 
thus far in the realms of theory of form, semiotics, rhetoric, and musical 
witticism. To suggest further research in this area, it might be interesting to 
see if the Schubert and Schumann fantasias hold up to the same picturesque 
aesthetic, or if new aesthetics had taken hold for the nineteenth-century 
fantasia.</p>
