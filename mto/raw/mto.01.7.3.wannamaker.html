<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[1] Introduction</b></p>
<P>[1.1] <I>Herma</I> (1961) for piano was Xenakis&rsquo;s first composition for a 
solo instrument. It was commissioned in 1961 by pianist/composer Yuji Takahashi, 
whom Xenakis met on a trip to Japan in April of that year. The Greek title may 
be translated as &ldquo;bond,&rdquo; but also as &ldquo;foundation&rdquo; or &ldquo;embryo,&rdquo; and perhaps 
reflects an intuition on the composer&rsquo;s part that this was to be a seminal work 
insofar as it was his first departure from purely stochastic means of 
composition.</P>
<P>[1.2] This technically very difficult piece makes unprecedented demands upon 
the performer, who must play complex rhythmic figures involving huge leaps with 
perfect evenness of articulation. In a good performance, the effort is repaid by 
the creation of a sense of seething, amorphous energy and a powerful forward 
momentum. The experience is unlike that associated with any prior piece in the 
piano literature. The ear strains to absorb it, but does not succumb to 
frustration or numbness. The frenzied sonic activity maintains a surprising 
sense of perceptual lucidity, never becoming muddy.</P>
<P>[1.3] The composer himself provides a detailed theoretical discussion of 
<I>Herma</I>&rsquo;s construction in his book, <I>Formalized Music</I>.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Referring 
to <I>Herma</I> as an example of &ldquo;Symbolic Music,&rdquo; Xenakis advances a model of 
the piece which involves the exemplification of specific mathematical 
relationships between certain pitch sets. The macro-structure of the composition 
is clearly outlined as well. Details regarding the specific pitch and rhythmic 
choices made are not included, however, and, while the composer makes 
indications of what <I>ought</I> to be listened for in the piece, a typical 
listening unavoidably raises certain questions which the composer does not 
address regarding what <I>actually is</I> heard. In particular, the ability of 
listeners to recognize the proposed model in the music, and the ability of the 
model to account for important aspects of the music as heard, both beg 
examination.</P>
<P>[1.4] This paper explores the relationship of the score to its set-theoretic 
model, and the relationship of both to the music as it is perceived. <a href="#SECTION2"> Section 2</a> 
introduces the composer&rsquo;s published model of the composition, expanding on his 
treatment. <a href="#SECTION3"> Section 3</a> subjects the musical materials of 
<I>Herma</I> to statistical analysis, which is appropriate given the composer&rsquo;s stochastic means of pitch 
selection. The statistical deployment of pitches is compared both to the 
published model and to the perceptual organization of musical details as 
revealed through the close reading of a representative score excerpt from the 
viewpoint of gestalt perception. Detailed examination of the score for 
consistency with the model is undertaken in <a href="#SECTION4"> Section 4</a> and certain significant 
discrepancies are identified. The implications of these are considered in <a href="#SECTION5"> 
Section 5</a> within a broader discussion of aesthetic issues raised by the 
relationship of the model to listeners&rsquo; perceptions and by the writings of the 
composer. An <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a> 
provides a brief introduction to the necessary mathematical background.</P>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="SECTION2"><b>[2]</a> <I>Herma</I> As a Set-theoretic Demonstration</b></p>
<P>[2.1] The composer adopts as a universal pitch set<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> <I>R</I>, the set of 
all 88 keys on the standard piano keyboard. From <I>R</I> he selects three 
subsets, <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>, with non-empty intersections. The 
central conceit of the piece is to present these pitch sets and others derived 
from them by means of elementary set operations in a fashion which will 
demonstrate that a given target set, <I>F</I>, can be expressed in terms of 
<I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> using two different set-algebraic forms (one of 
which is the disjunctive normal form discussed in the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>).</P>

<P>where I have introduced the convenient shorthand</P>
<P align=center><I>G = A B + <SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> 
<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN>.</I></P>
<P>The figure is divided in half by a bold horizontal line, the upper portion 
(labeled &ldquo;PLANE 1&rdquo;) corresponding to Equation 1 and the lower (labeled &ldquo;PLANE 
2&rdquo;) to Equation 2. Each &ldquo;PLANE&rdquo; is further subdivided into two rows of Venn 
diagrams, each row having a different dynamic marking to its right-hand 
side.</P>
<P>[2.3] The line of diagrams marked <I>fff</I> illustrates the four atomic sets 
appearing in the disjunctive normal form of <I>F</I>, while the line labeled 
<I>f</I> shows selected intermediate stages in the computation of these as 
intersections of <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, <I>C</I>, and their complements. Together 
these two rows of diagrams are apparently intended to demonstrate how the four 
relevant atomic sets are computed and united to yield <I>F</I>. The solid 
arrow-tipped lines connecting the diagrams are evidently meant to suggest the 
temporal flow of an imagined mathematical construction, consisting in essence of 
the line marked <I>fff</I> with lemmata interjected from the line marked 
<I>f</I>.</P>
<P>[2.4] The two lines which &ldquo;PLANE 2&rdquo; comprises similarly illustrate the 
computation of Equation 2, demonstrating diagrammatically that the result is the 
same as that specified by the disjunctive normal form. The development begins 
with the &ldquo;construction&rdquo; of <I>A B + <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> on the line marked <I>ppp</I>, 
before branching to illustrate the parallel constructions of <I>G C</I> (marked 
<I>ff</I>) and <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> (marked <I>ppp</I>), whose union 
is <I>F</I>. This illustrates the manner in which the figure preserves 
information about the structures of Equations 1 and 2, insofar as the rules of 
operator precedence (&ldquo;order of operations&rdquo;) required to compute the 
right-hand-sides of these equations partially dictate the order in which the 
Venn diagrams are arranged as read from left to right. Of course, the 
arrangement depicted is not the only one which might be employed to this end, 
since there is mathematical flexibility regarding the order in which the 
intermediate quantities are computed, so long as the order of operations is
observed.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></P>
<P>[2.5] The broken arrow-tipped lines in the diagram seem mostly to represent 
supporting observations traversing the two PLANES. Thus two broken lines lead 
from <I>ABC</I> and <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN> C</I> in PLANE 1 to their union, 
<I>(A B + <SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN>)C</I>, in PLANE 2. Some of the sets 
connected by broken lines, however, lack a simple algebraic relationship. For 
instance, <I>A B + <SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> is not immediately relatable to 
<I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN> C</I>.</P>
<P>[2.6] The composer describes the above set-theoretic considerations as being 
<I>outside-time</I> (p. 170), indicating that no reference to temporality is 
made or required. He observes that, to find employment in music, entities 
<I>outside-time</I> must somehow be combined with a <I>temporal</I> event schema 
to yield events <I>in-time</I>.</P>

<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 2</b>.

<P>[2.7] In <I>Herma</I>, a pitch set is articulated <I>in-time</I> as a 
sequence of pitches drawn from the set. (Indeed, the introduction of each new 
pitch set is indicated directly in the score with the name of the set.) The top 
line of <b>Figure 2</b> indicates the succession of different sets presented. 
Thus <I>Herma</I> commences with a substantial passage composed using notes 
selected from the set <I>R</I> (i.e., the entire piano keyboard). A section 
using only the notes of the pitch set <I>A</I> follows, with successive sections 
drawn from the contents of the sets <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline"><I>A</I></SPAN>, <I>B</I>, <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I>, <I>C</I>, and <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> in that order. Then the derived 
pitch sets corresponding to each Venn diagram in Figure 1 are introduced with the dynamic markings given in the 
figure and with new sets being introduced at the indicated dynamic and roughly 
in the order shown (reading from left to right). Some sets are given multiple 
expositions with subsequent presentations being marked <I>rappel</I> (&ldquo;recall&rdquo;) 
in the score. Different pitch sets are sometimes sounded simultaneously, with 
contrasting dynamics and temporal densities being employed to aid in their 
discrimination. Sometimes, as in the <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> sections, the 
<I>same</I> pitch set is articulated in two simultaneous layers with contrasting 
dynamics and temporal densities, consisting of, in the composer&rsquo;s terms, a 
&ldquo;linear&rdquo; (i.e., temporally sparse and dynamically loud) layer and a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; 
(i.e., temporally dense and, usually, dynamically soft) layer, with the sustain 
pedal depressed whenever a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; is being sounded.</P>
<P>[2.8] Individual pitches are drawn at random from the given sets without 
registral preference (except at one point in the <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> section: cf. <a href="#3.6">paragraph
3.6</a>). This 
employment of stochastic procedures, retained throughout the composition, is 
intended to avoid melodic or harmonic patterns that would serve to distract the 
listener from the perception of the pitch sets and relationships between them 
<I>as such</I>. In the words of the composer:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If we want to be free the sounds should follow without any melodic law, 
  independently of one another. So we have to play them at random.<nobr> . . . </nobr>How can 
  I demonstrate the elements of the sets? By playing them. But in order to 
  remain neutral I have to play them at random.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></P>
  <P>The elements of each class are presented stochastically, that is 
  unrestrictedly, in order not to disturb the basic plan of operations and of 
  logical relationship between classes.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[2.9] Each randomly selected pitch is associated with an attack randomly 
placed in time. The mean attack density per unit time does not change 
continuously with time, but assumes a sequence of constant values specified by 
the composer, with the abrupt change to each new density being indicated at the 
appropriate point in the score (e.g., as &ldquo;0.8 s/s&rdquo; or 0.8 sounds per second) and 
in <I>Formalized Music </I>(p. 177). Note durations appear to be randomly 
selected as well, although this is made definite neither by the score nor by the 
composer&rsquo;s writings about the piece. The opening <I>R</I> section exhibits a 
wide variety of rhythmic figures, but thereafter values divisible by a 
sixteenth-note or quintuplet sixteenth note (5:6) are employed almost 
exclusively. The work is notated mostly in 12/8 time with the exception of three 
brief occurrences of 6/8 in the second half of the work and the opening <I>R</I> 
section, which begins in 4/4 and visits a wide variety of time signatures. These 
markings notwithstanding, the composer&rsquo;s preface to the score indicates that, 
&ldquo;The whole piece is to be played without accents, the bar-lines serving merely 
as divisions in time.&rdquo;</P>
<P>[2.10] All pitch sets are musically represented strictly by means of 
displaying their members, randomly selected. Set algebraic operations (i.e., 
intersection, union, complementation), relationships between sets (e.g., 
equality), and rules of logic (e.g., implication) are not represented as such. 
The composer contends that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>If the observer, having heard <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>, hears a mixture of all 
  the elements of <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>, he will deduce that a new class is 
  being considered, and that a logical summation has been performed on the first 
  two classes. This operation is the <I>union</I>.</nobr> . . .</nobr></P>

  <P></nobr> . . . </nobr>we have not allowed special sonic symbols for the three operations<nobr> . . . </nobr>; only the classes resulting from these operations are expressed, and the 
  operations are consequently deduced mentally by the observer. In the same way 
  the observer must deduce the relation of equality of the two classes, and the 
  relation of implication based on the concept of inclusion (pp. 
171&ndash;172).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[2.11] Here, then, we have a model of <I>Herma</I> as an exemplification 
using pitch sets of the equivalence of two set-theoretic expressions. Pitch sets 
are represented by sequences of their members, randomly selected, with the 
succession of pitch sets corresponding to an exhibition of selected intermediate 
quantities that would be produced in a step-by-step computation of the 
expressions in question. The listener is left to deduce the relationships 
between different pitch sets and the meaning of the succession (i.e., to 
recognize that something is being exemplified, and what that particular 
something is). The composer aptly compares the function of musical time here to 
the expanse of a chalkboard:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The role of time is again defined in a new way. It serves primarily as a 
  crucible, mold, or space in which are inscribed the classes whose relations 
  one must <I>decipher</I>. Time is in some ways equivalent to the area of a 
  sheet of paper or a blackboard (p. 173).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[2.12] From the mathematical model of <I>Herma</I> discussed above, we now 
turn to questions regarding the perception of the piece by listeners. 
Requirements for a listener to be capable of following the set-theoretic 
exposition in question would have to include the following:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>complete and accurate characterization of each pitch set involved; 
  <LI>an ability on the part of the listener to discriminate and compare the 
  contents of different pitch sets, requiring accurate recollection of the 
  contents of pitch sets previously presented. </LI></OL>
<P>The next two sections address in detail the constitutive materials of 
<I>Herma</I> and the auditory perception thereof in light of the above criteria, 
and will attempt to identify any potential obstacles to the perception of the 
underlying set-theoretic model.</P>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="SECTION3"><b>[3]</a> Musical Segments in <I>Herma</I></b></p>
<P>[3.1] In describing the musical segmentation of <I>Herma</I>, I will use the 
language of temporal gestalt formation as developed by James Tenney.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> A 
detailed introduction to the subject of temporal gestalt formation in music is 
beyond the scope of this article, and we must restrict ourselves to a few 
relevant definitions. For a thorough discussion of the topic, the reader should 
consult Tenney&rsquo;s book. This terminology and conceptual framework are introduced 
in order to identify correspondences between the set-theoretic model and the 
musical segmentation as I hear it (and as I believe most listeners will hear 
it).</P>
<P>[3.2] Following Tenney, we will adopt the term <I>holarchical</I> instead of 
<I>hierarchical</I> in order to avoid any connotation of relative importance. 
For our purposes, we will regard the lowest holarchical gestalt level as that of 
the note and the highest as that of the piece. A gestalt at the holarchical 
level immediately above that of the note is referred to as a <I>clang</I> and 
constitutes &ldquo;a sound or sound-configuration which is perceived as a primary 
musical unit or aural gestalt.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> A gestalt at the next highest level is 
referred to as a <I>sequence</I> and consists of &ldquo;a succession of clangs which 
is set apart from other successions in some way, so that it has some degree of 
unity and singularity, constituting a musical gestalt on a larger perceptual 
level or temporal scale.<nobr> . . . </nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Finally, a temporal gestalt all of whose 
component, next-lower-level temporal gestalts exhibit the same overall 
statistical properties (mean, variance, etc.) in some particular sonic parameter 
are said to be <I>ergodic</I> in that parameter.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></P>
<P>[3.3] The second line in Figure 2 shows the temporal gestalt units associated with 
<I>Herma</I> at the first and second holarchical levels below that of the piece 
as I hear them. I will refer to these as <I>sections</I> and <I>subsections</I>, 
respectively.</P>
<P>[3.4] Inspection of the figure shows that sectional and subsectional 
boundaries are correlated with changes in temporal density, dynamic and timbral 
envelope (i.e., use of the sustain pedal). The composer systematically deploys 
such changes to aid in discrimination of the pitch sets. During the first 250 
seconds of the piece, these three parameters exhibit simultaneous changes which 
produce clearly demarcated sections and which are correlated with changes in 
pitch set. Throughout the work as a whole, gestalts at the sectional level are 
defined primarily by drastic changes in temporal density, with periods of 
silence or undisturbed sustained tones separating sections.&nbsp; These 
delineations are frequently supported by large changes in dynamic, changes in 
the use of the sustaining pedal, or both. Less drastic and coordinated changes 
in temporal density, dynamic, or sustain are responsible for temporal gestalt 
formation at the level of subsections.</P>
<P>[3.5] During the later portion of the work, when pitch sets change rapidly 
and temporally overlap one another, successive pitch sets are not separated by 
periods of inactivity and are distinguished only by changes in dynamic or 
pedaling. As a result, the holarchical level at which changes of temporal 
gestalt unit and changes of pitch set are correlated falls from that of the 
section to that of the subsection. This occurs around 250 seconds into the 
piece, at which point the first sets corresponding to intersections are 
introduced. After this, sections, which are still demarcated by hiatuses, no 
longer serve to define single pitch sets. This change itself, however, is not a 
perceptually salient event. In summary, we observe that all subsection 
boundaries coincide with pitch-set boundaries and <I>vice versa</I>, with the 
sectional/subsectional schema serving to embed the temporalized pitch-sets 
within a perceptual holarchy.</P>
<P>[<a name="3.6">3.6</a>] With one significant exception, the active pitch range remains the 
entire range of the piano keyboard throughout the composition, and the random 
selection of pitches is apparently uniformly distributed over the entirety of 
the active pitch set. The single brief exception occurs during the <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> section between 230 and 250 
seconds into the piece. At this point, the range engaged narrows towards the 
middle of the keyboard, culminating in a dramatic, fortissimo, chordal passage 
preceding the introduction of the first pitch sets derived from intersections. 
Otherwise, the pitch materials of the piece are ergodic at the holarchical level 
of section. That is, sequences within a subsection are distributed uniformly 
among all registers of the piano and this situation persists throughout the 
piece with the exception noted. (Our discussion will later return to the 
apparent aesthetic contradiction between a compositional approach based 
primarily on the articulation of specific pitch distributions and a perceived 
ergodicity in pitch materials.)</P>

<P>[3.7] At lower holarchical levels, the situation is more complex. <b>Figure 3</b> shows the frequency of occurrence of each pitch on the 
piano keyboard during the articulation of each pitch set. As in hexadecimal 
notation, the decimal numbers 10, 11, 12<nobr> . . . </nobr>are represented by the capital 
letters A, B, C<nobr> . . . </nobr>so that all entries in the table are single characters. We 
observe that all pitch classes are represented somewhere within each of 
<I>A</I>, <I>B</I> and <I>C</I>, thus ensuring a fairly chromatic musical 
texture. We also note that each of these sets consists largely of clustered 
&ldquo;clumps&rdquo; of pitches separated by considerable intervals, a tendency which is 
inherited by their complements and intersections. Otherwise the sets exhibit no 
simple structure. The composer describes them as &ldquo;amorphous.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></P>
<P>[3.8] It should be clear that randomly sounding notes that are uniformly 
distributed over such &ldquo;clumpy&rdquo; sets may sometimes produce an impression of 
multiple polyphonic lines (i.e., <I>auditory streaming</I> according to 
similarity in pitch<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>). This effect is perceptible throughout much of the 
piece, although it is usually complicated by other factors. Generally speaking, 
events stream according to complex interactions between their proximity in 
register (determined partially by the macro-structure of the pitch sets and 
partially by chance), their proximity in time, and their similarity in 
dynamic.</P>

<P>[3.9] <b>Figure 4</b>  shows a typical excerpt from the score: the final four 
measures of the exposition of set <I>A</I>, where &ldquo;linear&rdquo; and &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; versions 
of the set are simultaneously articulated. Circles indicate <I>clangs</I> as I 
typically hear them, with sequences of <I>clangs</I> connected by ties. The 
initial G4 is segregated from subsequent events by its dynamic, but such 
segregation is not consistent throughout the passage, as is immediately 
illustrated by the perceived grouping of the next three notes despite 
differences in dynamic. Here this is largely a product of the temporal proximity 
of the attacks, but also arises in part due to the continuous use of sustain, 
which blurs together temporally clustered events in the bass more effectively 
than ones in the treble. The following sequence in the treble is segregated by 
difference in pitch from the middle register tones, reflecting the 
macro-structure of <I>A</I> (i.e., the distinct clumps of pitches in <I>A</I> in 
the ranges F5&ndash;E6 and F4&ndash;G4, respectively). Indeed, each sequence identified in 
Figure 4 falls into a single one of the following clumps 
suggested by Figure 3 (except in the highest register, where the two-highest 
pitched clumps are regularly traversed): F1&ndash;F2, B2&ndash;D3, G3&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, D4&ndash;G4, F5&ndash;E6, and 
A6&ndash;D7.</P>
<P>[3.10] This should not, however, be regarded as evidence that the 
macro-structure of the pitch sets is the primary determining factor in low-level 
temporal gestalt formation. Many of the intervallic skips observed in this 
example between notes within a single clump are larger than the pitch intervals 
separating distinct clumps, so other factors clearly also contribute. As already 
indicated, these include similarity in dynamic and temporal proximity, but also 
subtler matters of accentuation and articulation which may vary from one 
performance to another. (For instance, the D2 in the third of the four measures 
shown in Figure 4 is inaudible in Takahashi&rsquo;s
performance.) Furthermore, 
the attitude of the listener makes an important contribution. In casual 
listening, for instance, one may attend primarily to the fortissimo notes, 
ignoring the pianissimo ones and thus perceive a much different set of 
gestalts.</P>
<P>[3.11] Perhaps the most important perceptual consideration regards the sheer 
complexity of the sonic information presented. In producing Figure 4 I proceeded in a rather traditional manner by attempting 
to identify distinct melodic voices one at a time, an approach which already 
presumes a very particular strategy for listening (i.e., one of attending to 
only to activity in a certain register in an attempt to identify a coherent 
melodic voice). It frankly seems impossible to grasp the seething entirety 
confronted as a whole, and when I try to do so my ear flits from one sequence to 
another, ignoring certain events in favor of others. The events perceived as 
salient seem to be as much the product of how one listens (possibly favoring 
certain registers, dynamics, etc.) as of the auditory stimulus, and the sense of 
the music as being &ldquo;too much to take in&rdquo; is indispensable to its overall musical 
effect.</P>
<P>[3.12] To a large extent, seemingly, it is this perceptual complexity and 
instability which lends the work its considerable musical richness, producing a 
kaleidoscopic profusion of fractured pitch sequences in different registers 
between which the listener&rsquo;s attention tends to skip. The uniform distribution 
of activity over the entire keyboard ensures that the density of sound in any 
given register remains relatively sparse. This produces a certain sense of 
lightness and lucidity, as opposed to the sense of density which would ensue if 
such a rapid succession of attacks were confined to a narrower pitch range.</P>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="SECTION4"><b>[4]</a> Discrepancies Between Theory and Realization</b></p>
<P>[4.1] A number of significant issues arise upon detailed comparison between 
the set-theoretical conception of <I>Herma</I> and its realization as a musical 
score. The first of these becomes apparent upon inspection of the <I>R</I> pitch 
set tabulated in Figure 3. It is clear that, although <I>R</I> nominally contains 
all 88 pitches playable at the standard piano keyboard, several are not actually 
represented in the introduction to the piece where <I>R</I> is articulated. In 
particular, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>1, E1, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>1, B2, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4, G4, and C5 are never sounded. This is 
presumably the consequence of using a random drawing procedure to determine each 
sounding pitch in succession, with pitches drawn remaining eligible to be drawn 
again. The exposition of <I>R</I> in <I>Herma</I> comprises only 205 
notes, but, using such a random selection scheme, a much larger number 
of draws will usually need to be 
made before all 88 different possible pitches have been obtained. Consider, for 
instance, a situation in which 87 different pitches <I>have already been 
drawn</I>. The final pitch remains one among 88, so on average a further 88 
draws will be required before it is drawn.  Indeed, a computer 
simulation employing ten million trials of the pitch lottery has shown that 
an average of 446 draws are required to obtain all 88
possible pitches (with a standard
deviation of 110 draws), and that the probability of obtaining all 88 pitches 
in 205 or fewer draws is extremely small (about 3 in 100000).
It seems reasonable 
to suppose that all 88 pitches are not represented in the introduction of the 
piece because the composer wished to curtail its duration without modifying his 
method of pitch selection.</P>
<P>[4.2] Nonetheless, the fact that certain pitches in any given set may not be 
acoustically articulated seems problematic. If the object of the composition is 
to demonstrate certain set-theoretic facts, then a complete representation of 
the sets of interest would seem to be a necessary prerequisite. An obvious 
solution to the problem of sectional duration would be to not return pitches 
drawn to the lottery. Then if one begins with a lottery containing <I>n</I> 
representatives of each pitch, one is assured that after 88<I>n</I> draws each 
pitch will have sounded precisely <I>n</I> times. In any event, no such 
procedure was adopted in the work at hand.</P>
<P>[4.3] By definition of set complementation (see <A 
href="mto.01.7.3.wannamaker.html#Appendix">Appendix</A>) 
we know that notes appearing in the <I>A</I> section of <I>Herma</I> ought 
theoretically to be absent from the <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> section. Inspection of Figure 
3 indicates that, in fact, there are twelve instances of identical pitches 
occurring in both sections. It is unlikely that these anomalies are the result 
of artistic license on the part of the composer, for two reasons. The first of 
these is the unambiguous commitment to the idea of a set theoretic demonstration 
cast in pitch which Xenakis makes in <I>Formalized Music</I>, a commitment which 
would be thoroughly betrayed by compromising the integrity of the pitch sets 
once they are defined. The second reason is that no aesthetic motivation for the 
introduction of the specific discrepancies is evident either in the score or 
upon listening. The perplexing notes do not seem to be specifically demanded in 
any obvious way by their musical context.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></P>
<P>[4.4] We must consider the possibility that notes found in common between a 
given set and its complement are errors arising either at the time of 
composition or in the typesetting of the score. The latter seems unlikely on the 
following grounds. <I>Herma</I> was written in in 1961 and premiered by 
Takahashi a few months thereafter. The Boosey and Hawkes score (see <a href="#FN6"> note
6</a>), the 
only score of the piece which has been published, is copyrighted 1967 and the 
data of Figure 
3 is derived therefrom. However, the Denon recording of <I>Herma</I> by 
Takahashi was made in 1972.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> The latter recording features at least some of 
the pitch discrepancies mentioned above. (Not all have been verified by 
listening, but at least B2, B3, D4, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4, F5, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>5, and C6 are clearly audible in 
both <I>A</I> and <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION:
overline">A</SPAN></I>.) 
Takahashi was in frequent contact with Xenakis throughout the 1960&rsquo;s,<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> and so 
the composer would have had ample opportunity to indicate corrections to the 
score if there were any to be made. Furthermore, since Takahashi had performed 
the work prior to its publication, he would likely have been working not from 
the Boosey and Hawkes score when he recorded it, but rather from a copy of 
Xenakis&rsquo;s manuscript. This suggests that the anomalies in the published score 
may have survived from the original manuscript.</P>
<P>[4.5] Comparing <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> with their complements, 33 
separate instances are observed of pitches appearing both in a set and in its 
complement. Proceeding for the sake of argument on the assumption that such a 
characterization is appropriate, we can attempt to identify which pitch 
occurrences are &ldquo;erroneous.&rdquo; Most of the discrepancies are of the sort in which 
a pitch occurs several times in a given set and only once in its complement. In 
such cases, the single occurrence may be assumed to represent the &ldquo;error.&rdquo; In 
other cases, a pitch may be relegated to one set or another after the 
examination of sets occurring later in the score. For example, the appearance of 
C8 in <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN> C</I> means that it must belong to 
<I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B </SPAN></I>rather than to <I>B</I>. 
Not all contradictions are so easily resolved, however. For instance, the pitch 
B1 occurs twice in <I>A</I> and twice in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I>. The only subsequent sets in 
which B1 is repeatedly observed are <I>G</I> and <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I>. Neither observation definitively 
places B1 in either <I>A</I> or <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> and, worse, the sets in question 
are themselves disjoint! In the end, we surmise that B1 belongs in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> on the weak evidence that other 
pitches in <I>A</I> sound several times during the exposition of that set (i.e., 
significantly more than twice). The question of whether B1 belongs in <I>B</I> 
or <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> presents similar 
difficulties. We place it in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> based on the fact that it appears 
in neither the exposition of <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> 
B <SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> nor in that of 
<I>F</I>.</P>
<P>[4.6] Eliminating problematic pitches from <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> 
allows the generation of what I will call &ldquo;best-guess&rdquo; sets. These can be used 
to algebraically compute the contents of pitch sets appearing later in the work. 
The &ldquo;best-guess&rdquo; sets and sets derived from them using algebraic computation 
software are shown in Figure 3 as shaded areas. These are to be compared with the 
numeric entries representing the observed frequency of occurrence of each pitch 
in the score. (Occurrences in the sections marked <I>rappel</I> have been 
included.)</P>
<P>[4.7] The agreement between observed and computed sets is excellent, with a 
few exceptions. Some expositions of sets (such as those of <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> and <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN></I>) do not exhibit all of the 
expected pitches, perhaps only because they are too brief. Indeed, <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN></I> is expected to contain 27 
different pitches, but its exposition comprises only 12 notes.</P>
<P>[4.8] In two cases a set is presented at length in the score but shows little 
agreement with the predicted set. In the case of <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> fewer than half of the scored 
notes fall within the predicted set. Curiously, the notes that fall outside the 
computed set occur almost exclusively within the first exposition of <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> while the notes heard in the four 
occurrences of this set marked <I>rappel</I> agree almost perfectly with the 
prediction. It is almost as if the first exposition is not of <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> at all, but is of some other set 
which is mislabeled in the score and in <I>Formalized Music</I>. Apparently this 
is not the case, however, for the following reason. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>2 and A3 are definitely 
members of the atomic set <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I>. Thus, if the &ldquo;unknown set&rdquo; can 
be expressed in terms of intersections, unions and/or complementations of 
<I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>, then it must contain <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> as a subset (see the <A 
href="mto.01.7.3.wannamaker.html#Appendix">Appendix</A> 
regarding disjunctive normal form). There are <I>very many</I> other members of 
<I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I>, however, which are not presented 
in the exposition in question, so it would seem that the &ldquo;unknown set&rdquo; heard in 
the first exposition marked <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">G</SPAN> 
<SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> cannot be expressed in 
terms of the sets <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>.</P>
<P>[4.9] The other set that agrees poorly with the predictions is <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I>. In this case, the contents of 
the initial presentation of the set and the single presentation marked 
<I>rappel</I> agree with each other, although it would also appear that the set 
observed cannot be expressed in terms of <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>.</P>
<P>[4.10] Where agreement between prediction and observation is generally good, 
a few discrepancies usually remain. Particularly troublesome is the pitch <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3, 
which occurs three times in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I>, five times in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I>, and ten times in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I>. This would imply that it is a 
member of <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> and therefore ought not to occur 
in <I>F</I> (see Figures 8 and 9 in the <A 
href="mto.01.7.3.wannamaker.html#Appendix">Appendix</A>). 
Nonetheless, it is observed to occur nine times there. One possible explanation 
is that the composer deliberately introduced this pitch so that <I>F</I> would 
contain at least one representative of each pitch class. Indeed, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> would not be 
represented in <I>F</I> if the offending <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 were excised. This explanation is 
partial at best since <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 is also present in pitch sets occurring earlier in the 
work where it ought not to be found, such as in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN> C</I> and <I>G C</I>. Alternatively, 
the fact that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>3 is observed twice in <I>C</I> might prompt us to include it in 
<I>C</I> in spite of its repeated observation in <I><SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">C</SPAN></I> which would then account for its 
presence in <I><SPAN style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style="TEXT-DECORATION: overline">B</SPAN> C</I>, <I>G C</I> and <I>F</I>.</P>
<P>[4.11] Whatever the case may be, we must conclude that the mapping of the 
proposed set-theoretic model of <I>Herma</I> onto its score does not satisfy the 
first criterion for the audible intelligibility of the model given at the the 
end of Section 2. First, the sets of interest are not completely represented in 
the score. It has already been remarked that this deficiency is manifest in 
<I>R</I>. The problem recurs, however, with respect to various pitch sets 
throughout the score. In each case there exist pitches that are represented in 
the score neither within the set in question nor within its complement.</P>
<P>[4.12] Furthermore, it cannot be said that the sets of interest are 
accurately represented from a mathematical perspective. The appearance of a 
pitch both within a given set and within its complement baldly contradicts the 
definition of complementarity. Inconsistencies appear to persist throughout the 
score based on the set-algebraic computations discussed above, in which 
significant disagreement between computed sets and their representations in the 
score is repeatedly observed.</P>
<P>[4.13] The second intelligibility criterion from Section 2, requiring that 
listeners be able to discriminate and compare the pitch sets of interest, also 
raises concerns. Psychological studies investigating the ability of subjects to 
name musical tones with different pitches have found that they can reliably do 
so only when the number of tones is less than 5&ndash;6 (although subjects with 
absolute pitch perform better).<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> each have 
more than twenty members and their complements, of course, have considerably 
more. Even allowing for absolute pitch to assist in the identification of 
different pitches, the capacity of short-term memory for items differentiated in 
a single dimension is usually taken to be 7 +/- 2 items so that a listener 
should not be able to retain such large harmonically amorphous pitch sets in 
short-term memory.</P>
<P>[4.14] It might be hoped that the clumpy macro-structure of the pitch sets 
could be of use in distinguishing them insofar as the emergence of voices 
occupying slightly different registers might be used to identify particular sets 
and transitions between them. In addition to the fact that set macro-structure 
is only one of several factors influencing stream formation (cf. <a href="#SECTION3"> Section 3</a>), 
other impediments to such identifications would exist. Due to the substantial 
number of different sets presented, the time required for a comprehensive 
sampling of their members to sound, and the considerable overlap between their 
contents apparent in Figure 3, it would be necessary to remember the detailed contents 
of several streams over a significant period of time in order to perceive the 
&ldquo;clumps&rdquo; with sufficient completeness and certainty to distinguish between sets. 
This would again overtax the usual limits of short-term memory.</P>
<P>[4.15] Theoretically, it might be possible with sufficient listening to 
commit each note of the piece to long-term memory, but this would represent an 
extremely unusual listening situation. It must be noted that Takahashi, after 
practicing the piece for months, wrote to the composer a letter containing the 
following passage: &ldquo;Theoretical conceptions of such great interest. Would like 
to have technical explanations. Let me know about Symbolic Music.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> If a 
practiced performer with a score in hand cannot grasp the work&rsquo;s construction, 
is it reasonable to assume that a listener should be able to do so?</P>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="SECTION5"><b>[5]</a> A Critical Summary Regarding <I>Herma</I></b></p>
<P>[5.1] Ultimately, the numerous inconsistencies between the score and its 
set-theoretic model which are discussed above remain, perhaps, a minor issue. In 
my opinion, they detract little from the effectiveness of the piece. This 
observation in itself, however, highlights certain deeper paradoxes associated 
with the compositional process.</P>
<P>[5.2] The dramatic surface of <I>Herma</I> conceals a deep-seated 
contradiction between the technical approach of the composer and its musical 
products. Xenakis is clearly serious about his conception of the work as a 
temporal blackboard upon which is inscribed a set-theoretic argument 
demonstrating the equivalence of two different expressions for the target set 
<I>F</I>. Nonetheless, this &ldquo;argument&rdquo; is entirely impenetrable to the listener. 
It is unrealistic to suppose that even musically astute listeners can apprehend 
and retain in memory large, harmonically amorphous pitch sets which are 
subjected to purely stochastic expositions. From a perceptual standpoint, the 
music is ergodic in pitch at the highest holarchical gestalt levels. Certainly 
no sense is ever produced of an argument cast in pitch proceeding towards a 
conclusion. If it were otherwise, one supposes that the set-theoretic 
inconsistencies discussed above would not be performed and recorded by musicians 
of the highest competence.</P>
<P>[5.3] It seems clear that no sense of forward motion or cathartic resolution 
is communicated by the pitch content of the piece. Rather, the momentum of the 
music is entirely a product of its rhythmic and dynamic intensity and the 
tremendous overt technical virtuosity which must be displayed by its performer. 
Similarly, the richness of the musical fabric is a product not of its specific 
pitch content, but rather of the complex and unstable perceptual streaming 
produced by the &ldquo;clumpy&rdquo; macro-structure of the pitch sets and the use of 
simultaneous contrasting dynamics and temporal densities (cf. Section 3). This 
result is ironic insofar as dynamics, rhythm, and timbre are all compositionally 
subordinated to specific pitch content, purportedly serving as devices to 
temporally demarcate the expositions of different pitch sets. Thus a fundamental 
contradiction exists between the compositional approach and the perceived 
result.</P>
<P>[5.4] This would be less remarkable if Xenakis had not previously been 
harshly critical of certain serialist composers on just such grounds. In his 
well-known article &ldquo;The Crisis of Serial Music,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> the composer upbraided 
serialists for</P>
<OL>
  <LI>the fundamental contradiction between their compositional methods 
  (involving the manipulation of musical lines) and the results thereof (a 
  perception of mass or surface, with no audible sense of &ldquo;line&rdquo;); 
  <LI>
  subsuming all other musical parameters to that of pitch. 
  </LI></OL>
  It would seem 
  that both of these criticisms could be as easily leveled at Xenakis&rsquo;s own 
  compositional approach in <I>Herma</I>, insofar as the set theoretic 
  construction is not audibly manifested despite the marshalling of dynamic, 
  temporal density and timbral envelope (i.e., sustain) to aid in the 
  discrimination of the different pitch sets.
<p>[5.5] Within Xenakis&rsquo;s compositional output as a whole, it may be that 
<I>Herma</I> is best viewed as a seminal/transitional work, as suggested by its 
title. Its straightforward set-theoretic construction is unique in Xenakis&rsquo;s 
oeuvre. Immediately subsequent compositions returned to purely stochastic 
considerations (<I>ST/10</I>, <I>Atrees</I>, and <I>ST/48</I> of 1962) or group 
theory (<I>Akrata</I>, <I>Nomos Alpha</I>, and <I>Nomos Gamma</I>, composed 
between 1964 and 1968). The latter pieces also mark the appearance of Xenakis&rsquo;s 
theory of scales (or <I>sieves</I>, in his terminology; see <I>Formalized 
Music</I> 194&ndash;200), which probably represents 
the most direct descendent of the set theoretic techniques adopted in 
<I>Herma</I>. This assertion is corroborated by Xenakis&rsquo;s own comments:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>In <I>Herma</I> I chose sub-sets from the chromatic scale&mdash;that is, I chose 
  some of the points on the straight line. After that I put to myself the 
  following question: How can one carry out this process on a more general level 
  which would comprehend all the scales used in the past and all those that may 
  come into use in the future? The sieve theory gives the answer. This answer 
  may not be complete, but it&rsquo;s certainly effective and many-sided.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Sieves are constructed with the aid of standard set-algebraic operations 
applied to pitch sets, but these primitive sets display definite regularities 
(unlike the &ldquo;amorphous&rdquo; <I>A</I>, <I>B</I>, and <I>C</I> sets of <I>Herma</I>). 
Thus the products of these operations can be made more easily apprehensible and 
discriminable to listeners.</P>
<P>[5.6] In my opinion, none of these considerations detract from the fine 
musical qualities to be found in <I>Herma</I>, among which the following must be 
counted. First, its texture seems almost amorphous and yet it maintains 
tremendous forward momentum (although it supplies no reassuringly obvious goal). 
The impression created is perhaps reminiscent of certain natural (volcanic or 
meteorological) processes. In this light, the inscrutability of its internal 
logic seems less troubling insofar as nature also operates by laws which are 
often concealed, although the composer&rsquo;s writings seem to suggest that this is 
not the light in which he would prefer to have the piece viewed 
(<I>Formalized Music</I>, 170&ndash;177).</P>
<P>[5.7] Furthermore, <I>Herma</I> refreshingly manages to eschew almost every 
established cliché of piano writing, although it cannot be said that it is 
entirely without precedent. Xenakis studied under Messiaen during the 1950s and 
it is reasonable to assume that <I>Herma</I> is informed by Messiaen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mode de 
Valeurs et d&rsquo;Intensites&rdquo; from <I>Quatre Etudes de Rhythme</I> (1949&ndash;50). The 
latter piece represents the first example of &ldquo;total organization&rdquo; composed in 
Europe, and as such is the product of a quite different compositional approach 
from that employed in <I>Herma</I>. Nonetheless, as Xenakis himself has observed 
regarding total serial organization (see <a href="#FN18">note 18</a>), the 
perceived results can be similar to those obtained using random procedures and 
the qualitative similarities between the two pieces in question are easy enough 
to hear. There is no question, however, that <I>Herma</I> goes far beyond 
previous models in unreservedly embracing the notion of a seething mass of sound 
as a viable alternative to linear writing. Hearing a good performance such as 
Takahashi&rsquo;s seems like nothing so much as getting caught in a storm.</P>
<P>[5.8] In the end it may seem that <I>Herma</I> is successful for listeners on 
grounds other than those which facilitated its construction by the composer. 
What is the proper object of analysis in such a case? As in much music, there 
may exist subtly or markedly different analyses germane to the composer, the 
performer and listener. (Perhaps even to each listener.)<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></P>

<P>[A.1] A <I>set</I> or <I>class</I> is a collection of objects, called

with subsets thereof represented by areas demarcated within the rectangle. In Figure 5 a set <I>A</I> is represented by the area within a

	<p><a name="FN1">1.</a> Iannis Xenakis, <I>Formalized Music</I>, rev. ed. (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).&nbsp; Page number references  to this book are given in the text  henceforth.<br><a href="#FN1REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN2">2.</a> Throughout this article, we concern 
ourselves with pitches, as opposed to pitch classes, unless otherwise

diagram as given by Xenakis have been corrected in <a href='wannamaker_fig1.html' target='_ex'>Figure 
1</a>. First, the region corresponding to <I>ABC</I> in the leftmost figure on 
the <I>ff</I> line has been shaded, where it was blank in the original. Second, 
a missing overline has been added to the character <I>C</I> in the rightmost 
figures on each line (both <I>ppp</I> and <I>ff</I>). Also, I have deduced that 
the broken line between <I><SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN> 
<SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>B</SPAN> C</I> and <I>(A B + <SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN> <SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>B</SPAN>)C</I> should have its arrowhead pointing at the latter rather than the former.<br><a href="#FN3REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN4">4.</a> Xenakis observes that the form of Equation 2 is more computationally 
efficient than the disjunctive normal form of Equation 1 in the sense that it 
involves fewer total union, intersection, and complementation operations. The 
difference is ten operations versus fourteen, assuming that intermediate results 
are available for multiple re-uses once computed. In particular, observe that 
once <I>A B + <SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN> <SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>B</SPAN></I> has been computed, it can be used 
to compute <I><SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>G</SPAN></I> by means of a 
single complementation, as opposed to computing <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>G</SPAN></I> from scratch using <I>A</I>, 
<I>B</I>, and <I>C</I>. This fact has little practical implication for the 
composition, however, since not all of the different operations involved are 
sequentially illustrated. PLANES 1 and 2 each contain fewer than the respective 
fourteen and ten diagrams, with the <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>G</SPAN></I> <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>C</SPAN></I> diagram, furthermore, being 
repeated.&nbsp; Xenakis indicates that seventeen operations, rather than 
fourteen, are required to compute the right-hand side of Equation 1 
(<I>Formalized Music</I>, 173).&nbsp; This would be the case if the complements 
<I><SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN></I>, <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>B</SPAN></I>, and <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>C</SPAN></I> could not be multiply re-used in

the notion of &ldquo;fuzzy sets,&rdquo; first introduced into the scholarly literature in 
1965 by engineer and mathematician Lotfi A. Zadeh as a generalization of the 
classical set concept (Lotfi A. Zadeh, &ldquo;Fuzzy Sets,&rdquo; <I>Information and 
Control</I> 8 (1965): 338&ndash;353). Is it possible that Xenakis anticipated this 
concept in 1961?</p>

<P>A &ldquo;fuzzy set&rdquo; is one whose elements can possess degrees of confidence of 
membership between zero (in which case the element certainly <I>is not</I> in 
the set) and one (in which case the element certainly <I>is</I> in the set). In 
a classical (or &ldquo;crisp&rdquo;) set, on the other hand, the degree of membership of any 
element is either <I>precisely</I> one or <I>precisely</I> zero.</P>
<P>If the degree of membership of an element <I>x</I> in a given fuzzy set 
<I>A</I> is, for example, 0.8, then the degree of membership of <I>x</I> in 
<I><SPAN style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN></I> is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. Thus, 
one would expect to observe <I>x</I> in a randomly drawn sample set whether it 
was drawn from <I>A</I> or <I><SPAN 
style='TEXT-DECORATION: overline'>A</SPAN></I> (albeit with greater frequency in 
a sample set drawn from <I>A</I>).</P>
<P>Nonetheless, I maintain that a fuzzy set model is not appropriate for 
<I>Herma</I>, for the following reasons. First, nowhere in his detailed 
theoretical discussion of <I>Herma</I> in <I>Formalized Music </I>does the 
composer introduce any concept relatable to fuzzy sets. Indeed, his description 
of complementation clearly assumes classical sets: &ldquo;If class <I>A</I> has been 
symbolized or played to [the listener] and he is made to hear all the sounds of 
<I>R</I> except those of <I>A</I>, he will deduce that the complement of 
<I>A</I> with respect to <I>R</I> has been chosen&rdquo; (page 171).</P>
<P>Furthermore, it should be noted that it is impossible in principle for a 
listener or analyst to determine with certainty the precise degree of membership 
of any given pitch in a fuzzy pitch set from a finite random sampling of the set 
in question. That is, if it were given that fuzzy sets were employed in 
<I>Herma</I>, it would not be possible to definitively characterize them either 
upon hearing the work or upon inspection of the score. The composer 
unequivocally advances a model of the work as a set-theoretic argument cast in 
pitch. The introduction of fuzzy sets would not only represent an unmotivated 
complication of the exposition, but would prevent the terms in that exposition 
from being determinable with perfect confidence.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> Iannis Xenakis, <I>Herma</I>, Yuji Takahashi, piano.
