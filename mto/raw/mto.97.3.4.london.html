<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In volume 3.2, <i>MTO</i> published an essay by Rosemary Killam on
the exclusion of works by women composers in textbooks and
anthologies dedicated to 20th-century music.  In volume 3.3, <i>MTO</i>
published a response by Michael Morse, one which questions some
of the claims and statements made in Killam&rsquo;s original essay.
Professor Killam&rsquo;s observations are incontrovertible:  there is
little or no music by women composers in current texts and
anthologies.  This omission has occurred even in a climate where
women&rsquo;s music has received newly-found historical and analytical
scrutiny and in which many women have flourished as composers.
The exclusion of women&rsquo;s composition in such a climate is, as
Prof.  Killam has shown, more than a little puzzling.  The
question is &ldquo;why?&rdquo;  While I appreciate how some of Prof.
Killam&rsquo;s descriptions of the current state of affairs in music
pedagogy follow from the tenets and politics of radical feminism
(a sort of &ldquo;if you aren&rsquo;t part of the solution, you are part of
the problem&rdquo; point of view), I also appreciate the distinction
that Prof. Morse makes between inadvertent omission and
premeditated exclusion.  My purpose here is not to pursue these
arguments any further, but to place Killam&rsquo;s observations in a
wider context, namely, &ldquo;what else don&rsquo;t we examine in our 20th
century musical curricula?&rdquo;  In such a context, another
explanation for the exclusion of music by women composers becomes
plausible.
</p>

<p>[2] Most courses in the history and/or analysis of &ldquo;20th-century
music&rdquo; (or the analogous portion of a larger theory/history
sequence) ignore most of the musical activity of our time.  There
is usually no non-western music, no examples of jazz or pop or
musical theater, no western musics in oral traditions (such as
Appalachian folksongs), no functional religious music (with the
possible exception of Messiaen), and so forth.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> One could
generalize Prof.  Killam&rsquo;s argument to claim that current texts
and anthologies are racist (nothing by minority composers),
anti-religion (no examples of liturgical music), and elitist (no
examples of music from popular culture).  We suffer from a
modernist myopia, of which the exclusion of women&rsquo;s music is but
one symptom.
</p>

<p>[3] In a recent article in <i>repercussions</i> Christopher Williams
reviewed Robert Morgan&rsquo;s anthology (which Prof.  Killam also
discusses).<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Williams observes that Morgan, like the other
anthologist-authors noted by Killam, hews to a rather narrow
canon of works in mapping out its history of 20th century music:
&ldquo;The tenacious narrowness of this canon has been remarkable,
persisting despite several waves of recent criticism&rdquo; [pages
31&ndash;32].  What is clear from a quick perusal of Lester, Straus,
Kostka, and Morgan is their common emphasis on familiar pieces
and theoretical topics:  pre-serial atonality, serialism, and
post-serialism, as is exemplified by the music of Debussy,
Bartok, Stravinsky, and of course Schoenberg and the first and
second generations of his students.  Music since 1945 gets
limited attention, with those works which continue the
Schoenbergian tradition receiving the most attention.  Notably
absent are mentions (let alone discussions of works) of W.C.
Handy, Robert Johnson, Louis Armstrong, Thomas Dorsey, Duke
Ellington, Elvis Presley, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Dave
Brubeck, or Paul Simon (to name but a few which come to mind).
When jazz and popular musics are mentioned, as in Bryan Simms&rsquo;
<i>Music of the Twentieth Century</i> (New York:  Schirmer Books,
1996), they are for the most part discussed in relation to their
appropriation by &ldquo;serious&rdquo; composers; thus Ragtime and Dixieland
Jazz are valued mainly in their use by Darius Milhaud.  The
&ldquo;Music of the 20th Century&rdquo; discussed in these recent texts is
for the most part neither very new nor particularly
representative of the music making of our time.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The emphasis
on modernism, then, and a small body of works which serve as
exemplars of that style, may be regarded as perhaps the primary
reason that music by women (and others) is neglected in our
textbooks, anthologies, and course syllabi.
</p>

<p>[4] In fairness to Morgan, Straus, Lester, and Morgan, one should
not take these authors to task for the books they didn&rsquo;t write.
Morgan, for example, is most explicit about his self-conscious
choice not to include non-canonical works in his text:  &ldquo;Another
decision concerns the types of music to be included.  Here the
scope has been limited almost entirely to Western &rdquo;art&ldquo; music,
with popular music, folk music, and jazz, as well as non-Western
music of all types, touched upon only insofar as they have
directly influenced concert music<nobr> . . . </nobr>Given the constraints of
space it seemed unwise to try and cover such a rich and varied
field&rdquo; (page  xiii).  Inherent in this decision, however, lies the
tacit assumption that of all the musics of our century, it is the
modernist works that are the most important for our students to
know and understand.  This assumption does not lie solely with
the authors of these texts, of course&mdash;they are writing for a
scholarly market that holds these same assumption(s).  As such,
the contents of these books are indicative of what most theorists
and composers, either reflexively or self-consciously, think they
ought to cover when called upon to teach a course in 20th-century
music and musical analysis.
</p>

<p>[5] I would also point out that most theorists have a detailed
and passionate knowledge of many styles and genres of
20th-century music, from the blues to Broadway.  Indeed, it is
often the case that we try to work a few examples from these
musics into our other syllabi every now and then.  Thus we have a
situation where the members of our discipline, most of whom are
well aware of the musical activities of this century that lie
outside of the modernist canon, nonetheless rarely have the
opportunity (in a systematized fashion) to present those other
works to their students.  As Killam noted in her essay, most of
the theorists were well aware of the music of women composers,
but failed to include them in their texts and anthologies anyway.
Why do we continue to pass over in silence various musics which
so many of us know and love?
</p>

<p>[6] There is an old story about how a man who is feeling
generally unwell goes to his doctor, and as his doctor cannot
diagnose his condition, sends him off to a series of specialists.
Each examines the man in turn, and each finds the cause of his
ailment:  the cardiologist finds a circulatory problem; the
internist finds a bowel problem; the neurologist finds a disease
of the brain; the psychologist finds it all stems from a boyhood
trauma, and so forth.  The moral here is that when presented with
a problem, a specialist tends to frame that problem in terms of
his or her specialty.  And it seems to me that this is what is
going on in our 20th-century curricular habits.  We are
specialists in a particular kind of musical diagnosis
(specifically serial and set theory), and therefore we tend to
apply those diagnoses to the music we encounter.  Moreover,
unlike the physician, we have the ability to choose our own
patients, and so (not surprisingly) we choose to examine those
musical &ldquo;patients&rdquo; for whom our special methodologies are most
apt.  In other words, we talk about those pieces we know how to
talk about.
</p>

<p>[7] It takes years to grasp the details of serial technique and
set theory, and thus it is quite natural for us to want to make
use of those tools we have labored so long and hard to acquire.
And by the same token, because we work so hard to be able to
conduct a certain kind of music-analytic discourse, it also is
quite natural for us to reflexively valorize those musics which
engage such tools.  Moreover, to properly communicate the hows
and whys of modernist music to our students takes time&mdash;time to
present the pieces, and even more time to explain, if only in
cursory fashion, the means by which their composition and
structure may be understood.  As a result, there is often little
time remaining in a term or semester for the examination of other
works.  Nor can one simply add another course (a &ldquo;beyond
modernism&rdquo; course, perhaps), given the limited resources of most
faculties and the strictures on our curricula.  We simply run out
of time and teachers in most undergraduate programs before we can
get beyond the 20th-century modernist canon.  Indeed, one could
say that many other important musics (e.g., western medieval and
renaissance music in some programs) are similarly pushed off the
margins of current curricula.
</p>

<p>[8] There are thus personal and practical reasons for our dogged
maintenance of the modernist canon.  The kind of revision that
Killam asks for is not simply, as she suggests at the end of her
essay, the addition of some works by non-canonical composers to
our syllabi.  Our syllabi are already packed with lectures on
theory and analytical demonstrations.  This is a zero-sum
equation:  something must be subtracted in order to make room for
other pieces and other modes of discourse.  Changing our syllabi
requires hard choices about what is essential to include in the
student&rsquo;s introduction to the theory and analysis of 20th-century
music.  And this leads me to question why we value the modernist
canon so highly in the first place.  Claims of modernism&rsquo;s
music-historical influence, once trumpeted so loudly, would seem
to be lacking in empirical support.  Assessments of its aesthetic
importance are similarly problematic, and I will not rehearse
those discussions here (for a sensitive reading of some of the
aesthetic issues see Williams, op.  cit.).  What <i>is</i> clear is
that the exegesis and appreciation of the modernist canon is an
enterprise which requires a maximal amount of effort on the part
of student and teacher for a small, circumscribed body of works.
Is the musical reward worth the musical effort, such that we
demand it of <i>all</i> of our students?  Let me emphasize that the
question is not what some students (e.g., composition, theory, or
history majors) must take, but what we should generally require
of those students who would be music majors.  It is also a
question of what we acknowledge to be the proper domain of our
professional attention when we address the music of our time.
</p>

<p>[9] Since it is not fair to simply criticize and run, I will
conclude with a number of proposals for new categories under
which a syllabus in 20th-century analysis might be organized.  I
find that these categories have several advantages.  The first is
that they are a more accurate reflection of the musical activities 
of our century, not simply in terms of the most popular genres (in 
a brute statistical sense) but also those which seem to have the
most influence and aesthetic import.  Another advantage is that
these categories readily allow for the inclusion of music by
women, minorities, and others who are excluded in the modernist
canon.  Lastly, because it is organized by genre rather than by
composer or compositional technique, one has a bit more
flexibility in one&rsquo;s choice of what pieces can and should be
included.

<p>[10] Williams (op.  cit.)  has also suggested some new categories
for inclusion in the 20th-century canon, including (a)
&ldquo;Weltanschauungsmusik&rdquo; for music which is &ldquo;preoccupied with
metaphysical issues&rdquo; (page  61, after Herman Danauser, in the
volume of the <i>Handbuch der Musikwissenschaft</i> devoted to
20th-century music, Lauber:  Lauber-Verlag 1984), (b) Ja&rsquo;nacek as
a category unto himself, (c) Opera, a genre neglected in most
courses, and (d) the Nordic/Slavic Symphonic Tradition (modeled
after Bruckner).  These are historical categories, by and large,
and thus differ from those I suggest here in that my interest is
in the inclusion of various styles and genres of music for their
analytic significance, though of course their historical
importance is not inconsiderable.  While the aims of analysis and
history courses differ, and thus so too will their pedagogical
canons to some extent, it is also true that the analytic canon is
supported by an implicit historiography.  It is this
historiography which needs to be uncovered and resisted, in order
for substantive changes in our analytical aesthetic to take root.
Here then follows a modest proposal for alternative categories
for a course in 20th-century music:
</p>

<hr>

<p>[10.1] <b>The song.</b>  The sheer volume of song composition in the
20th-century staggers the imagination, yet most of the emphasis
our curricula is on instrumental music, as if the outpouring of
song and other vocal compositions did not exist.  Moreover, as
the composition of a song and the setting of its text presents a
number of familiar problems, the study of songs can be a most
effective means of introducing students to both tonal and
non-tonal composition.  One could readily imagine an entire
course on songs and song-cycles in the 20th-century, but even as
a unit within a larger course one could discuss a wide range of
great songs, from Berg to Berlin to the Beatles.
</p>

<p>[10.2] <b>&ldquo;Formes fixes&rdquo; of the 20th-century.</b>  Though closely
related to song forms, the 12-bar blues and the melodic/harmonic
structure based on Gershwin&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Got Rhythm&rdquo; have proved to be
structural scaffolds for a wide variety of instrumental
compositions and styles.  Mastery of these formal archetypes
would seem to be analogous to the mastery of other formal
archetypes in other eras, such as the 18th century minuet and the
14th century ballade and virelai.
</p>

<p>[10.3] <b>Film music.</b>  In the domain of the cinema we find music as
a component of the larger Gesamtkunstwerk.  In film scores we
find the maintenance of the 19th-century tonal and melodic
language (for their semiotic utility) alongside 20th-century
techniques for expressive effects.  It is worth noting that our
students are probably more familiar with the idioms of classical
and romantic music through film scores than anything else.
Composers from Steiner to Stalling are of interest, and
recordings (though not always scores) are readily available.
</p>

<p>[10.4] <b>Musical theater:  from Gilbert and Sullivan to Broadway to
Opera.</b>  I am here regarding music in a theatrical setting more as
a continuum than a set of discrete genres.  There is a natural
overlap with film music here, in its presentation of text, music,
and scene, but then too there are problems unique to the
production of music in a live context.  Repertoire ranges from
Joplin&rsquo;s <i>Treemonisha</i> and Rogers and Hart to Bernstein and
Stravinsky.
</p>

<p>[10.5] <b>Music in an age of mechanical reproduction.</b>  In an era of
mechanical reproduction and pop-music-as-commodity one also finds
the return of ephemeral music.  There are also radically new
compositional techniques engendered by the modern sound studio,
the tape deck, and the synthesizer, techniques which go beyond
the usual discussions of Stockhausen and early analog synthesis.
Examples abound from the theremin to the Kurzweil and from Les
Paul and Mary Ford to Public Enemy.
</p>

<p>[10.6] <b>The interplay between Western and non-Western music.</b>  The
idea here is not to usurp the role of the introductory courses in
ethnomusicology, but rather to confront the problems of analyzing
music, parts of which may be borrowed from other cultures (or
within our own).  As the availability of recordings of
non-western music allows contact with the music of other cultures
in unadulterated form the use and disuse of western notation (or
any system of notation) raises a number of issues.  Also of
interest is the reciprocal impact of western music on other
cultures.
</p>

<hr>

<p>

[11] Doubtless there are other categories, and doubtless these
can be streamlined and improved.  I hope that they at least
prompt some reflection and consideration on our current
pedagogical practices.  As Prof.  Killam reminds us, our choices
of repertoire and readings in our courses are one of the most
significant choices we make as teachers.  These choices should
not be made reflexively, or simply on the expediency of what is
covered in various texts, but should reflect our views of the
aesthetic, cultural, and historical significance of the music of
our age.</p>
