<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Since the days of the earliest electronic computers,
musicians have engaged them in a veritable love/hate
relationship. We seem to have little or no indifference towards
computers. Indeed, individually we seem either to embrace them
with a passion or to shy away from anything concretely or
representationally related to them. I do not want to imply,
however, that there are not gradations&mdash;layers so to speak&mdash;of
interest, particularly among the convert group (after all, that
really is the intended audience for this review). Here you will
find the pedagogues, the catalogers, the analysts, and the
cognitive and artificial intelligence explorers to name but a
few. You will also find overlapping camps of those with an aural
bent and those with a visual one. Of course, across all of these
boundaries there exist degrees of involvement among respective
members. In other words, there are &ldquo;users&rdquo; (e.g.,
non-programmers) and their are &ldquo;doers&rdquo; (e.g., programmers).&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[2] <i>Beyond MIDI: The Handbook of Musical Codes</i> is a compilation
of reports and documents from numerous authors. The work, edited
by Eleanor Selfridge-Field, Consulting Professor at the Center
for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities at Stanford
University, is a book that is clearly aimed at the doers. In
fact, it aims high enough to propel itself beyond many
&ldquo;apprentice doers&rdquo;&mdash;this is not a work for the faint of heart. If
you happen to be one of the real &ldquo;power doers,&rdquo; however, it
speaks clearly and with an effective voice. At its most profound
level, <i>Beyond MIDI</i> is a book that discusses the nuances and
intricacies of computer-based musical descriptions, the languages
and vehicles by which we are able to interact with or make
observations about the phenomenon known as &ldquo;music.&rdquo; At its
simplest level, it is an extremely valuable handbook for those
who wish to harness computers to facilitate such interactions. In
either case, the work succeeds in conveying what is important to
the reader, partly because it is a book written by insiders for
insiders. It takes someone well versed in the complexities of
computer programming&mdash;the &ldquo;power doers&rdquo;&mdash;to appreciate fully the
profound nature of the information being shared, and it is
precisely these sorts of professionals who have been engaged to
supply the information for the book. Included are such notable
practitioners as Max Matthews, Stephen Dydo, Thomas Hall, Leland
Smith, Donald Byrd, David Huron, and Walter Hewlett.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[3] This is not another MIDI programmer&rsquo;s handbook, yet it gives
a surprisingly detailed and explanative summary of this language.
It lacks examples of many code models, yet is an effective
exposition on how to represent music in a computer environment.
The book confronts us with a marvelous dichotomy: it is both
incomplete, yet complete. It omits much, yet gives more than one
could hope for. It accomplishes what most well-written books
should but few actually do: it presents us with enough of the
right information targeted at the appropriate audience and
presented in such a way that it enables the reader to continue
where the book leaves off. In this case, it empowers those of us
who are &ldquo;doers&rdquo; to propel ourselves into the status of &ldquo;power
doers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>

OVERVIEW&nbsp;</p>

<p>

[4] This work is actually an outgrowth of an initiative of the
Study Group on Musical Data and Computer Applications sponsored
by the International Musicological Society, and co-chaired by
Walter B. Hewlett and Selfridge-Field [xvii]. According to
Selfridge-Field, the purpose of <i>Beyond MIDI</i> is &ldquo;to provide a
general description, with encoded examples, of numerous ways of
representing music in the computer&rdquo; (xv). Such an overtly terse
statement, while elegant in its simplicity, belies the
accomplishments of the work. Her reasons for creating the
compilation are stated with significantly more zeal&mdash;a tone more
befitting the spirit of the book:
<blockquote>
     <p>
     Hundreds of codes for music have been developed. Most are
     intentionally made invisible to users. Not so happily,
     documentation about many musical codes is extremely scarce.
     This scarcety impedes applications. It deprives many
     potential users from investigating the relative merits of
     different schemes for data representation. It thwarts
     discussions of generalized representational systems. Worst
     of all, it imprisons data sets within the confines of the
     specific applications for which they were created. [xv]</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>

[5] As someone trained in computer programming, it was always
stressed to me that a computer program is essentially a set of
data combined with a collection of means, or tools, for
manipulating that data effectively. At the heart of all good
programs is a well-developed, powerfully flexible data model: one
capable of supporting profound exploration and revelation, yet
also capable of expressing subtle nuances. Music, in whatever
form it is perceived or explored, presents us with an extremely
complex set of data that requires an extraordinary
representational model even to begin to capture its essence. No
one model can embody it all; instead, we must strive to solidify
and implement those concepts necessary to meet our immediate
needs. Beyond MIDI attempts to do just that by offering us a
pastiche of numerous different models for accomplishing musical
representations. The work does not overtly attempt to be profound
in what it offers. Instead, the editor reverts to a rather
apologetic tone when she states that
<blockquote>
     <p>
     the emphasis of the <i>Handbook</i> is intended to be on
     practical concepts. While the <i>Handbook</i> cannot serve as a
     complete reference for any one code, it is designed to
     cover the basic features of pitch, duration, articulation,
     dynamics, timbre, and other defining features of music. It
     also describes the file organization for each code, existing
     applications, data archives (where relevant), existing file
     interchange provisions, published references, and sources of
     further information [xvi].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Were this work nothing more than a set of simple documentations
it might not merit the attention being given to it. And,
documentation is essentially what it is. Yet, the nature of what
it is being documented and the audience to whom it is being
addressed empowers it with a profound sense of purpose: it is the
appropriate information presented at the appropriate level of
detail to address the needs of a specific set of needy users. Nor
does the book offer the reader a complete set of documentation,
instead it presents the user with a selective subset of
information targeted at the already knowledgeable user. A word
processor manual, for example, may utilize many of pages of
documentation to explain just the basics of text selection to a
novice user. Yet, one page of appropriate information might
unleash powerful nuances of macro creation to someone already
well versed in the topic. In other words, this book is both
selective, yet capable of generating powerful insights. One could
easily argue that the value of the work lies, not in the content
found within, but solely in the mind of the reader, a notion with
which I would not totally disagree. The strength of this text,
instead, lies in its ability to enable the reader to infer, to
speculate, to resolve, to reconcile all of those loose
associations and half-understood concepts that can plague us
incessantly without any easy recourse for resolution.&nbsp;
<p>

CONTENT&nbsp;</p>
<p>

[6] As part of a rather selective approach to the amount of
detailed information about each code set discussed in the text,
the editor strives to emphasize those codes that are as
comprehensive as possible in their attempts to represent the
broadest spectrum of musical information. The lure of &ldquo;total&rdquo;
representation has now been pursued for roughly three decades.
This volume gives considerable recognition to those systems which
aim to provide the greatest degrees of completeness. Yet no one
involved with the most competent of systems claims that any piece
of music can be represented at the 100% level in all of its
conceivable aspects. Every system makes sacrifices somewhere to
optimize clarity of its preferred features [5].&nbsp;</p>
<p>

[7] Nonetheless, the work includes a considerably large body of
code examples spanning a broad array of formulaic approaches to
solving problems in the representation of musical data.
Selfridge-Field begins by grouping most data models into four
general usage categories: those based on &ldquo;sound or phonological
context, the notation or graphical context of notation, the
rational context of analytical parameters, and the semantic
context of musical perception and understanding&rdquo; (7). She goes on
to state that the book explicitly concentrates on the first three
of these. More specifically, she points out that the choice of
materials presented in the book are aimed first at introducing
the reader to &ldquo;the general subject of music representation,
showing how intended applications influence the kinds of
information that are encoded&rdquo; (20). Her second aim is &ldquo;to present
a broad range of representation schemes, illustrating a wide
variety of approaches to music representation&rdquo; (20). All of these
data models were then grouped rather arbitrarily into ten
different categories, each containing at least two sample
schemes, while acknowledging that in some categories dozens of
models were available to chose from. In nearly every case, the
individual models are documented by individuals closely
associated with those representational schemes. One exceptional
feature of the book is the mandated inclusion of several relevant
musical excerpts that are then coded as a working examples for
each correlative chapter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

[8] Rather than discussing each model here, I present a listing
of what is included. The very complex nature of each model
effectively precludes encapsulating in a few words what has taken
others years to conceive and implement. The best solution I
believe is the one presented in the book&rsquo;s table of contents, and
I choose here simply to recreate it as Figure 1 (contributing
authors are referenced in &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>

	<li>Afterward: Guidelines for New Codes [David Halperin]</ul></ol>

CONCLUSIONS&nbsp;
<p>

[10] This work is amazingly free of any significant problems. The
text seems extremely accurate&mdash;at least as far as one can tell
with so much complicated data incorporated both in tables and
within the text. With the exception of the last chapter, the text
also seems to be very well organized. I feel that the section
entitled &ldquo;Beyond Codes: Issues in Musical Representation&rdquo; really
belongs with the opening introductory chapters of the book.
Selfridge-Field offers us a brief, yet engaging, discussion about
the nature of codes: What attributes are essential?; How general
vs. how specific should a code be?; etc. While one might see
these as logical extensions of the exploration of the preceding
500+ pages of code documentation, it is probably unrealistic to
think that most readers will actually sit down and read their way
through the entire book. After all, this work is more a powerful
reference tool containing a compelling collection of data than a
&ldquo;compelling&rdquo; story line. Yet, this final chapter does represent a
fitting conclusion to the opening discussions and certainly
should be included as an integral part of the opening stages of
the work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

[11] Perhaps more problematic is the lack of a summary of the
abbreviations used throughout the code-definition portions of the
book. This omission is a problem that will be more acutely felt
by the &ldquo;users&rdquo; than by the &ldquo;doers.&rdquo; For example, most programmers
are familiar with reading and interpreting hexadecimal codes and
variable symbols; yet most non-programmers, while perhaps
somewhat familiar with hexadecimal numbers, would not
automatically be able to infer the appropriate meaning in an
unfamiliar context. Their appearance in code definitions absent
of any explanation as to why they are being used and how they
should be interpreted within that context can generate
significant confusion or even leave an example completely
undecipherable to such a non-practitioner. For example, the
section on MIDI defines a pitch event as:
<blockquote>
    <p>
	PITCH [kkkkkkk: note# &lt;n>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, no attempt is made to define the meaning of the
various elements present in the definition. For example, kkkkkkk
stands for the first seven bits of an eight-bit byte used to
store the integer representing a particular pitch. None of this
information is explicitly offered as an explanation by the
author&mdash;what I present here is just my informed interpretation. A
few pages later, the definition for a duration is given as:
<blockquote>
    <p>
	DURATION [00:00:00 or 00:00:00:00]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This example is even more problematic, as the 00s are not a
direct computer representation as the k&rsquo;s were in the previous
example. Here, each group of zeros stands respectively for bars,
beats, and fractions of a beat, or hours, minutes, seconds, and
frames. The actual definition for how to represent that
information in the computer does not appear until 15 pages later.
Fortunately, most of the code in the book is reasonably easy to
decode for someone with a fair amount of programming experience.
And, in many respects, eliminating much of the explanation
enables the authors to present the pertinent information more
succinctly. What makes this text work so well for the &ldquo;power
doer,&rdquo; however, is precisely what keeps it from working for the
novice user.&nbsp;
<p>

[12] No single work can serve the multiple needs of every
practitioner, and this book is no exception. If you are anywhere
close to considering yourself a &ldquo;doer,&rdquo; and if you have even the
slightest inclination to explore the world of music with a
computer, however, then having this text within easy reach is an
absolute must. There is no other source that comes close to
matching the breadth, quantity, and quality of information
amassed in this one work. Much of the information simply is not
available anywhere within easy reach. I must commend the editor
and contributing authors for a splendid job of creating an
invaluable reference work.</p>
