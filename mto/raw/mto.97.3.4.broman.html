<p>[1] The Department of the Psychology at University of Uppsala, Sweden,
hosted the Third Triennial conference for the European Society for the
Cognitive Sciences of Music (ESCOM), 7&ndash;12 June, 1997.  Roughly 120
papers were presented during the conference&rsquo;s nineteen sessions:
Tristan Cor Anglais Tune; Analysis and Modeling of Cognitive Dynamics
Underlying Musical Behavior; Music Cognition: Pitch, Scales, Tonality;
Composition, Improvisation; Music Performance: Representation,
Practice, and Reading; Musical Psychoacoustics; Ethnomusicology; Music
Cognition: Melody, Rhythm; Music Performance: Psychological and Social
Aspects; Music Analysis: Composers, Works, Genres; Musical
Development; Music Performance.  Measurements; Music Analysis:
Modeling; Music and Bodily Movement, Dance; Music Cognition: General;
Music Experience; Music and Neuropsychology, Music Performance: Motor
Processes; and Music Performance: Modeling.  There were also three
keynote addresses: &ldquo;Musical Tension: Cognitive, Motional, and
Emotional Aspects&rdquo; by Carol L. Krumhansl (Cornell University); &ldquo;Can
One Seriously Speak of Narrativity in Music?&rdquo; by Michel Imberty
(University of Paris X&mdash;Nanterre); and &ldquo;Standing Together Under One
Umbrella: A Multidisciplinary and Interdisciplinary View of Music
Psychology&rdquo; by Donald A. Hodges (University of Texas at San Antonio).<p>

[2] Several music-theory oriented papers were given, including
&ldquo;&lsquo;Octave Equivalence&rsquo; versus &lsquo;Octave Relatedness&rsquo;: Circle versus
Helix; Chord versus Melody&rdquo; by Eytan Agmon (Bar-Ilan University);
&ldquo;Scales, Sets, and Interval Cycles: A Taxonomy&rdquo; by John Clough and Nora
Engebretsen (SUNY at Buffalo); &ldquo;Recent Diatonic Theory and Curwen&rsquo;s
Tonic Sol-Fa Method: Formal Models for a Kinesic-Harmonic System&rdquo; by
Jay Rahn (York University); &ldquo;Tonal Closure&mdash;Fact and/or Fiction&rdquo; by
Bengt Edlund (Lund University); &ldquo;Prolongational Structure and
Schematic Form in Tristan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alte Weise&rsquo;&rdquo; by Fred Lerdahl; &ldquo;Wagner,
Tristan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Alte Weise&rsquo;: Two perceptual approaches&rdquo; by Irene Deliege
(University of Liege); &ldquo;Quelques jalons pour une reflexion
d&rsquo;hermeneutizue psychanalytique a propos du solo de cor anglais du
IIIe Acte de Tristan&rdquo; by Michel Imberty (University of Paris
X&mdash;Nanterre); and &ldquo;The Tristan&rsquo;s Cor Anglais Solo: A Semiological
Analysis&rdquo; by Jean-Jacques Nattiez.  Unfortunately, the session on
Tristan (the aim of which was to compare the different analytic
approaches in the concluding discussion) was given at the same time as
the Pitch, Scales, Tonality session.  All proceedings were printed in
their entirety prior to the conference by the Department of Psychology
at Uppsala University (ISBN 91-506-1230-1).<p>

[3] In &ldquo;&lsquo;Octave Equivalence&rsquo; versus &lsquo;Octave Relatedness&rsquo;: Circle
versus Helix; Chord versus Melody,&rdquo; Eytan Agmon warns against the
indiscriminate application of octave equivalence, arguing that
&ldquo;contrary to popular belief, octave equivalence does not imply
&lsquo;inversional equivalence&rsquo; of intervals.&rdquo; In constructing his argument,
Agmon invokes a distinction between the concepts of Octave Equivalence
and Octave Relatedness: The former could be conceived of graphically
as a circular arrangement of the pitch classes in a single plane and
the latter as a helical model of pitch.  Agmon asserts that, in
practice, the distinction between these two concepts is based upon
perceptual differences within melodic and chordal contexts&mdash;octave
relatedness applies in melodic contexts, while octave equivalence is
assumed in chordal contexts. This conclusion, 
Agmon notes, is
supported by existing literature in the field of music perception&mdash;for
example, Deutsch and Boulanger conclude that &ldquo;[<nobr> . . . </nobr>] octave equivalence
effects should not operate directly in the processing of melodic
intervals,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>&mdash;and in turn supports a 
conceptual distinction between
Roman-numeral and figured-bass approaches to chordal analysis.<p>


[4] In &ldquo;Scales, Sets, and Interval Cycles: A Taxonomy&rdquo; John Clough and
Nora Engebretsen begin by noting that while recent discoveries in
scales theory may seem diverse, they are connected through their
common emphasis on the role of interval cycles in the generation of
scales.  In particular, Clough and Engebretsen focus on eight
properties of scales&mdash;<i>generated</i> (Wooldridge notation), <i>well-formed</i>
(Carey and Clampitt), <i>Myhill-property</i>  (Clough and 
Myerson), <i>maximally
even</i>  (Clough and Douthett), <i>diatonic</i> (Agmon; Clough and 
Douthett), <i>deep</i> (Gamer), <i>Balzano</i>, and one previously undefined 
property, <i>distributionally even</i>, under which a generic interval comes in
either one of two sizes.  They identify a network of implicative
relationships among these features, and then present a taxonomy, based
on twelve different combinations of these features, governing all
pitch-class sets corresponding to interval cycles or cycle
combinations.  Algorithmic approaches to the generation of all pc sets
with specific combination of features were also discussed.<p>

[5] In addition to describing interactions among various scale
properties and thus unifying recent contributions to scale theory,
Clough and Engebretsen also hinted at relationships between their work
and that of others&mdash;including Eytan Agmon&rsquo;s linear transformation
property and Richard Cohn&rsquo;s maximally smooth cycles&mdash;and suggested
possible areas for further study related to their newly defined DE
property.  This presentation was a revised version of the paper with
the same title presented at the AMS/SMT Conference in New York in
1995.<p>

[6] In &ldquo;Recent Diatonic Theory and Curwen&rsquo;s Tonic Sol-Fa Method:
Formal Models for a Kinesic-Harmonic System,&rdquo; Jay Rahn explores
different aspects of English educator and priest John Curwen&rsquo;s
(1816&ndash;1880) ear-training pedagogy.  Curwen was the inventor of Tonic
Sol-Fa Method including the hand-sign system that is still in use
today within the Kodaly tradition, for instance.  Rahn discusses the
logic underlying Curwen&rsquo;s system, describing, for example, how the
distribution of vowel sounds among the seven syllables and the visual
and motor-kinesic aspects of the hand movements correspond to voice
leading and tendency-tone properties of the diatonic scale.  Rahn
suggests that, in this respect, Curwen&rsquo;s hand signs &ldquo;illuminate one of
the most difficult distinctions in music theory, between scale
and tonality,&rdquo; in that they model distinctions between and the
interaction of consonances and dissonances. Rahn 
also notes an
isomorphism between Curwen&rsquo;s hand signs and Benjamin Boretz&rsquo;s
formulation of voice-leading structures and triadic tonality, and sets
out to extend Boretz&rsquo;s work.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> More 
specifically, Rahn discusses
Curwen&rsquo;s privileging of the tonic, dominant, and subdominant triads on
the basis of the following relationship:  the tonic triad plus its
transpositions upward and downward by five semitones/three scale
degrees yields the complete scale.  Rahn formalizes this property,
focusing in particular on the cardinality of the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; chord
versus that of the scale, on the distribution of intervals of two and
three scale degrees within the &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; chord, and of course on the
degree of transposition required to generate the entire scale.
Patterns of resolution, then, are arranged symmetrically about a tonic
half octave.  This formalization leads to the fascinating insight that
&ldquo;Curwen&rsquo;s structures implode and explode fractally&rdquo;&mdash;a notion Rahn
illustrates with the example of a nineteen-note scale, generated from
a seven-note tonic chord which itself displays a Curwen resolution
pattern.<p>

[7] Rahn concludes with some thoughts as to how one might test for the
functioning of Curwen patterns in an experimental setting.  In his
final paragraph, however, he takes an ideological turn, which is as 
unexpected as it is stimulating: &ldquo;Whereas delicate non-pitch (i.e., 
timbral, micro-rhythmic/loudness) factors are all one can cite in 
defense of Curwen&rsquo;s apparently Euro-centric privileging of major 
(as well as root position, dominant skewing, and raised leading-tones), 
one must acknowledge that Curwen&rsquo;s formulation itself has been for more 
than a century a worldwide factor in shaping production, perception,
cognition, and conceptualization at all levels of formal training.
Arguably, the closed, &lsquo;totalizing,&rsquo; hierarchical structure of Curwen
tonality has been a powerful agent of European aesthetic hegemony,
enabling quick &lsquo;overlearning&rsquo; of authoritative, tonal structures,
while erecting barriers to subsequent influence in &lsquo;other&rsquo;
possibilities.&rdquo;<p>

[8] The most provocative music-theoretic presentation was Bengt
Edlund&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tonal Closure&mdash;Fact and/or Fiction.&rdquo; Edlund presented the
results of an experimental study in which five groups of university-
level music students listened to versions of Schubert&rsquo;s Waltz in
B minor (no. 10 from op. 18/D. 145), altered with the intent of
eliminating tonal closure.  The entire composition contains only two
eight-bar periods, each of which is repeated.  The first section
begins in B minor and ends on D major, and the second section ends in
B minor.  Edlund altered the piece in two ways so that it ends in D 
major.  In the first version, D major is prolonged from the double 
bar through the end of the piece; in the second version, the first 
section ends in B minor, and D major is not established until toward 
the end of the piece.  Given the direction &ldquo;something is odd with the 
harmonic/tonal development of the music&mdash;find out what it is!,&rdquo; more 
than half of the eighty-eight subjects were unable to identify the 
problem&mdash;even after three to five playings in some cases.  Listeners, 
Edlund concludes, do not demand tonal closure even within the context 
of a short, harmonically straightforward piece.<p>

[9] On the basis of these rather distressing results, Edlund urges us
to examine the relationship between perception and theories of musical
structure, and questions in particular the relevance of Schenkerian
analysis&rsquo;s emphasis on tonal closure&mdash;and thus the relevance of
Schenkerian analysis itself.  &ldquo;The principle of tonal closure, the
<i>Ursatz</i>, is not only considered to be aesthetically 
vital&mdash;Schenkerian 
theory necessarily ascribes fundamental <i>methodological</i> importance 
to it.  
If the existence of the <i>Ursatz</i> (along with much of the 
middleground 
activities prolonging it) is perceptually unimportant when you listen, 
why should it govern the analyst&rsquo;s eye?  Is the metaphysical foundation 
for it really strong enough to support the element of top-down processing 
in tonal analysis?  And what else is left to recommend it when the 
collected analytic evidence from successfully reduced masterpieces can be
questioned?&rdquo;<p>

[10] Whether or not Edlund&rsquo;s experiment 
demonstrated the listener&rsquo;s
lack of interest in tonal closure is open to some debate.  Following
his presentation, for example, the question was raised as to whether
his subjects might not have heard the first variant as a D-major piece
beginning on the submediant&mdash;a point Edlund himself had conceded in
his paper. However, since similar results have 
been reported by
others&mdash;Edlund cites Nicholas Cook<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> and Vladimir Konecni and Mitchell
Karno<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup>&mdash;Edlund&rsquo;s criticisms might 
better be addressed on a different
level.  Even if a majority of listeners do not attend to tonal closure,
would this suggest that the Schenkerian approach is somehow flawed?
After all, tonal closure is undeniably a characteristic trait of the
works to which Schenker intended his analytic approach to
apply&mdash;whether or not the majority of listeners recognize its
presence.<p>

[11] Although Edlund himself acknowledges that &ldquo;there is no intrinsic
need for an analytic theory to model perception,&rdquo; he suggests that
&ldquo;[<nobr> . . . </nobr>] we should be wary not to adopt the notion that there is no
intrinsic relationship between the value of a theory and the extent to
which it deals with the musical phenomena we hear, indeed with the
musical surface we see.&rdquo;  In his haste to dismiss Schenkerian analysis
on the basis of his experimental findings, Edlund fails to acknowledge
that Schenkerian analyses do capture numerous perceptually salient
foreground details, including motivic relationships and details of
voice leading.  Indeed, it is doubtful that musicians such as Murray
Perahia would show interest in Schenkerian analysis if this approach
did not yield perceptually relevant musical insights.  Certainly
different insights might be gained, as Edlund argues, &ldquo;from other,
less &lsquo;tonal&rsquo; reductions, from descriptions that are suppressed by
analytical orthodoxy,&rdquo; but his findings are by no means as
&ldquo;devastating&rdquo; as he suggests and absolutely do not support the
outright abandonment of one of the most powerful analytic approaches
we have for tonal music.</p>
