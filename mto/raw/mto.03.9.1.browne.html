<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] It is a pleasure, in more ways than most of you can know, to be here tonight   and talk about the founding of our Society. I am pleased to see so many old   friends, former students now distinguished professors, and new members of   our Society. My remarks tonight are unabashedly personal and, while I don&rsquo;t   apologize for using the first person singular, I do regret that I cannot   mention everyone else who played a significant part in the activities that   led to the founding of the SMT.   When we founded the SMT, it was in some ways a controversial and   confrontational act.</p>

<p>[2] We were frustrated. We had a vision.   Our goal was to create a profession. We hoped that there would be theorists   25 years later who knew and respected each other and who had achieved   academic respect by virtue of the efforts of SMT. That clearly has   happened. Those of us who started out many years before the founding of SMT   in 1977 were inspired only by a vision of things to come. We are now   vindicated (at least in part). That is to say, we may continue to be   vindicated if the current SMT develops along clear and pragmatic lines.   Otherwise, I think the whole theory enterprise may yet founder. I will say   more about that, but first let me describe the situation as it existed   before 1977.</p>

<p>[3] At first (I&rsquo;m talking about the 1930&rsquo;s) there were only a few people who   thought about theory as more than just the teaching of rudiments. That is all   &ldquo;theory&rdquo; was at that time (and so it remained for many more years).   Norman Cazden (a great theorist: look up his Harvard dissertation to understand   why I say that); Tom Turner at Iowa; Bill Poland a bit later at Ohio State were   lonely pioneers. In the 50&rsquo;s, the musicologists consolidated their position   (based on the founding of the AMS in around 1934). Academic music itself came   together as a generality in the CMS around 1954. In the late 60&rsquo;s, some composers   became organized with the founding of the ASUC. Yet theory teaching remained   something just &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; could do, and there were only hybrid jobs--with   the theory portion presumed within the competence of any good performer, music   historian, or composer. There was no way to be just a theorist. I will explain   later what I think the core competence of a theorist is. It rests on mastery   of analytic technique of core repertoires. That was, and is, our central claim.</p>

<p>[4] As a personal note: when I graduated from Yale in 1958, having been trained   as a composer, but given a vision of generic theory by David Kraehenbuehl (founder   of the JMT), I knew that I wanted to spend my academic life as a theorist&mdash;speculating,   explaining, modeling the musical process as it can be studied on paper and in   real time. When I taught at Yale from 1960 to 1968, I found a new breed, almost   a new creed around me in the persons of Allen Forte, Don Martino, James Drew   and Jim Tenney. Yale was creating a model for theorists and analysts and teachers   who were not hybrids&mdash;though the need for demonstrable musicianship of a high   order has always been a subtext. On leaving Yale in 1968, I chose to go to the   University of Michigan because it had a free-standing department of theory and   seemed promising as a base for creating more Ph.D. programs in theory and eventually   for starting a national theory society. While I was teaching at Yale, very fine   people were at Princeton (calling themselves composers but in fact becoming   masterful theorists), and very good musicians were teaching theory in various   other places and beginning to ask for a more systematic approach to the explanation   of musical process.</p>

<p>[5] Let me take up the situation as I found it in 1968. There were only about   20 doctoral degrees in theory or theory/something in the U.S. and only about   175 masters programs that even mentioned theory. Within 4 years, the University   of Michigan had a Ph.D. in music theory&mdash;and others followed. By that time numerous   discussion sessions had been mounted by me and others at ASUC, CMS, even at   AMS. The other societies were lukewarm about theory. Composers remained solipsistic:   &ldquo;I am a composer; I only teach theory because I have to.&rdquo; Musicologists   claimed they were already theorists (a claim they maintain to this day). But   other individuals had been thinking about a theory grouping: the invaluable   Carlton Gamer, wily Gregory Proctor, the veteran and wise Bill Poland. The Music   Theory Society of New York State (MTSNYS) invented itself in the early 70&rsquo;s   and their leaders helped greatly in the formation of the SMT.</p>

<p>[6] At Iowa in 1974, a rump meeting onstage after an Andrew Mead lecture included   John Rahn, John Hanson and others (again forgive me for not remembering everyone)   and decided spontaneously to go for it&mdash;in some vague way. Two things were decided   then and there: NOT to try to do it fast and pre-emptively (that had been ASUC&rsquo;s   great mistake) but instead to plan ad hoc meetings for a while and see if we   could build demand for a national theory society. The motto was: plan the next   thing and have no members or apparatus for now. The result was the first National   Conference on Music Theory (based on similarly titled Michigan meetings I had   built) which was piggy-backed onto the next ASUC meeting in Boston with the   help of Ben Boretz and Elaine Barkin. You can see how much depended on convergence:   a consilience of inductions.</p>

<p>[7] At that meeting, Cazden actually showed up, as did Tom Turner and other   experienced people. The debate raised the usual questions: do we know what theory   is? why leave (or seem to oppose) the societies that now exist? can we find   enough people? It seemed obvious that we needed to know about the demographics   and raise the ante on our motives. The result was, at first, a panel at the   next CMS meeting called &ldquo;Music Theory: the Art, the Profession, and the Future.&rdquo; As its organizer, I titled my own remarks &ldquo;If We Are All Theorists, Why Aren&rsquo;t We All Theorists?&rdquo; Papers by Allen Forte, Vernon Kliewer, Peter Westergaard,   Carl Schachter, and Carlton Gamer were so compelling that CMS president William   Reynolds stopped the next issue of CMS Symposium until I could edit them for   publication. On the basis of that session, Wallace Berry (then University of   Michigan and CMS Board member for theory) arranged for a second National Conference   on Music Theory (sponsored by CMS ) at Evanston&mdash;and the outcome you know.</p>

<p>[8] But there was still a lot of work to be done. An informal group, mostly   of people I have mentioned above, was kept together and enlarged. We began to   plan Evanston. I grabbed the (then new) CMS Directory of Music Faculties and   built (by hand in my Ann Arbor living room, using hand-written lists and IBM   punch cards!) a list of individuals which included all known theorists plus   at least one known faculty member in every college or university that had a   masters or doctoral program that mentioned theory. My mailing list brought over   300 people to Evanston and resulted in nearly 500 members of SMT after Evanston.   I call this the Big Bang&mdash;from about fifteen people to 500 members in a virtual   instant!</p>

<p>[9] There was debate at Evanston&mdash;but the result was a motion to establish   our Society. (Please see my report in the first volume of <i>Music Theory Spectrum,</i>   and, for the curious, my report the day after Evanston in the 1977 NASM journal.   Some deans were not amused.) Our first executive board was elected at the assembly   by ballot to represent ten geographic regions. It met immediately and elected   Allen Forte president, Wallace Berry vice president, Richmond Browne secretary,   and Mary Wennerstrom treasurer. It is my personal opinion that if Allen Forte   had not been persuaded by Wallace Berry to become a leader in our movement,   we would not be here tonight. Mary and I stayed in our roles for many years   to provide institutional memory as the SMT evolved.</p>

<p>[10] As a new board, we had to set priorities: building membership, deciding   to have a Journal, asking Jim Harrison to write us some Bylaws, and setting   our first meeting as a Society (which turned out to be Minneapolis 1978)&mdash;and,   most importantly, planning when to meet again soon. We did that in January 1978   in my IBM living room in Ann Arbor amidst a total Michigan blizzard&mdash;and again   that Spring in New Haven, where we incorporated the Society (in New York State)   and chose Bryan Simms to edit the first issues of <i>Music Theory Spectrum.</i>   (The title Spectrum was an inspired suggestion from Allen Forte.) The history   from then on is contained in our archives (kept by me until 1992 and now at   the University of Maryland). However, I have one more topic tonight&mdash;perhaps   the most important, in my mind.</p>

<p>Why did we do it? Who did we think we were? What should the Society do   now?</p>

<p>[11] My answer is that we were no longer satisfied with purely historical   answers to questions of analysis. We felt that theorists should be able to explain   the structure of a piece, or a phrase, on some basis other than the taxonomical   descriptions so long handed down. The work of Schenker and of Babbitt (plus   Forte) pointed to heuristics for analysis that needed to become central to our   thinking and our teaching. The only way to get the academic stature needed for   future theorists was to create the only apparatus academia respects: a society,   a journal, more Ph.D. programs, a supply of young theorists who could actually   teach theory as such. That has all happened, at least in part.</p>

<p>[12] However, it has not been a total success, in my view. Many prominent institutions   have never signed on. Many schools have ignored us, ignored Schenker, ignored   Babbitt, and continue to present music theory the way it was presented when   I first saw it in the 50&rsquo;s. But the enormous gift to the musical community we   have provided with our intellectual and speculative vision cannot be denied.   We have every reason to be proud as we celebrate our 25th anniversary as a learned   society in music. So that&rsquo;s why we did it. </p>

<p>But who did we think we were?</p>

<p>[13] My answer is that theory rests on analysis based on intellectual power,   not just description. A theorist is a master analyst&mdash;certainly of tonal   music, preferably also of 20th century music, and preferably of some other historical   or contemporary genre. The proliferation of worthy topics like jazz, feminism,   world music or cognition is welcome and adds to the value of music education   in itself&mdash;but the rock of theory is analytic mastery. To the extent that   the SMT as a group, or individuals who call themselves theorists, walk away   from the analytic agenda, so much do they and we risk marginalizing ourselves.   Diversity cannot be a cover for the SMT becoming an orphanage.</p>

<p>[14] My advice may seem harsh, but it is given out of love for all who preceded us, for everyone here tonight, and for all who will continue to work in the name of theory.</p>
