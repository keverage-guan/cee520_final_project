<section>
<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] A curious tendency encountered among the numerous existing commentaries on 
Beethoven&rsquo;s piano sonata in E-flat major, Op. 81a, is to downplay the significance of the 
work&rsquo;s representational trappings. To be sure, Beethoven himself has warned against taking 
descriptive titles too literally when he qualified his &ldquo;Sinfonia caracteristica&rdquo; as 
<i>Mehr Ausdruck der Empfindung als Mahlerei</i>.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Yet I doubt that any commentator on Op. 68 
has voiced an opinion comparable to Walter Riezler&rsquo;s, who states that &ldquo;the 
superscriptions <nobr>. . .</nobr> intended for the first and last movements of [Op. 81a] <nobr>. . .</nobr> today sound 
faintly comic, and Beethoven himself can hardly have meant them to be taken too 
seriously.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p><p>

[2] While Riezler represents an admittedly extreme case, his uneasiness with the sonata&rsquo;s 
extra-musical pretensions is shared by other commentators. Wilibald Nagel, for example, 
who does not rank Op. 81a among Beethoven&rsquo;s outstanding masterworks, accounts for its 
popularity by referring derogatorily to its descriptive titles. &ldquo;The outwardly apparent 
has the quickest impact on the general public,&rdquo; Nagel explains, &ldquo;in general, and 
specifically in the arts.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
Even a commentator as Carl Dahlhaus, who never questions the sonata&rsquo;s artistic merits, 
prefers to emphasize its qualities as &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; music (its &ldquo;formal&rdquo; 
aspect), at the expense of its qualities as program music (its &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; aspect). 
&ldquo;The sadness at Archduke Rudolph&rsquo;s departure and the joy at his return,&rdquo; says 
Dahlhaus, &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> are not by any means made more explicit by the painting of details 
during the course of the musical development; rather, they become more remote as the 
&lsquo;formalization&rsquo; proceeds. As the formal elaboration of the motives grows more refined, and 
the relationships between them are made increasingly distinct, so the reference to 
extraneous reality fades and dissolves.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Indeed, Beethoven&rsquo;s famous admonition 
<i>Mehr Ausdruck der Empfindung als Mahlerei</i> has been put to good use in this 
respect, for it seems to relieve the analyst from the burden of proposing some 
<i>specific</i> representational interpretation of the music, not counting the (seemingly) 
transparent instances of pictorialism.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p><p>

[3] Why is Op. 81a, Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;grosse charakteristische Sonate,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> apparently a problem for many 
commentators? A number of commentators (though probably not the more recent ones) 
have quite possibly formed the erroneous impression that the public display of affection 
from one man to another that the work exhibits is inappropriate, if not downright 
perverse.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> However, a less 
loaded explanation also exists. As Anton Rubinstein has pointed out, &ldquo;in the first 
movement, <nobr>. . .</nobr> the character of the Allegro, after the introduction, does not throughout give 
expression to the usual idea of sorrow at parting.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Faced with such a (seemingly) glaring 
contradiction between title and content, commentators may have simply felt compelled to 
downplay the former&rsquo;s significance.</p><p>

[4] The present essay is an attempt to resolve the problem of musical representation in 
Beethoven&rsquo;s Op. 81a by evoking the psychological notion of loss. The notion of loss, and in 
particular the related idea of an inner struggle between denial and acceptance, makes it 
possible to view the virile, energetic Allegro of the first movement as representationally 
wholly appropriate; as a result, there is no need either to question the validity of 
Beethoven&rsquo;s inscriptions, or to resort to his famous admonition as a convenient 
smokescreen. At the same time, sufficiently specific connections between Beethoven&rsquo;s 
music and the emotional realm can be drawn to offer a significant alternative to pictorialism. 
Although much of what follows concerns the sonata&rsquo;s first movement only, an interpretation 
of the entire sonata shall be suggested as well.</p>

<h3>The Meaning of the Interrupted Lebewohl-Motto</h3>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="agmon_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1 thumbnail" src="agmon_ex1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>
<p>[5] Any representational interpretation of Op. 81a may well begin with the disruption, both 
textural and harmonic, that the left-hand&rsquo;s entry in measure 2 inflicts upon the right-hand&rsquo;s 
Lebewohl-entity initiated one measure earlier (<b>Example 1</b>). Leonard Meyer believes that 
&ldquo;this [deceptive] cadence further defines the ethos of the motto, bringing &lsquo;the eternal 
note of sadness in&rsquo; and perhaps suggesting that the parting is not final.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Indeed, as Meyer subsequently points out, 
Beethoven&rsquo;s placing of the horn figure at the <i>beginning</i> of the composition rather 
than the end, where it more typically belongs, is already deviant.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> However, I believe there is more to the left-
hand&rsquo;s interference with finality than Meyer suggests.</p>

<p>[6] Several commentators have suggested a possible connection between Beethoven&rsquo;s Op.
81a and Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capriccio on the Departure of His Beloved Brother&rdquo; (BWV 
992), apparently composed when Bach was only nineteen years old on the occasion of his 
brother Johann Jacob&rsquo;s departure to join the retinue of the King of Sweden.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Kenneth Drake&rsquo;s observations are most 
illuminating in this regard. Noting that Bach conceived his first movement as depicting the 
attempts of the brother&rsquo;s friends to deter him from embarking on his journey,<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Drake presents examples from 
both Bach and Beethoven where &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> melodic continuity and harmonic movement are 
held back, display vacillation, and are postponed <nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> Surely, though, the quintessence of held-
back harmonic movement in Beethoven is the deceptive cadence of measure 2, which Drake fails 
to cite. It thus appears that Beethoven&rsquo;s movement is not so much a depiction of the sorrow 
of parting, as is commonly assumed; rather, like Bach&rsquo;s, the movement depicts (or at least 
begins by depicting) an instinctive reaction of any human being to a projected departure of 
someone he or she deeply cares for: <i>preventing that someone from executing the pain-
afflicting plan</i>. This, I believe, is the meaning of the left-hand&rsquo;s interference with finality 
in measure 2, signified (as Meyer and others have rightfully observed) by the right-hand&rsquo;s 
Lebewohl-motto. </p><p>

[7] In light of Bach&rsquo;s capriccio, in other words, the first movement of Op. 81a may be 
interpreted as depicting an external struggle, namely, Beethoven&rsquo;s struggle against 
Rudolph&rsquo;s intended departure. As in the fourth movement of Bach&rsquo;s work, where the friends 
realize that the brother&rsquo;s departure is inevitable and bid farewell, by the end of Beethoven&rsquo;s 
movement the struggle against Rudolph&rsquo;s projected departure subsides, and leave-taking 
takes place. However, I believe that even greater insight into Beethoven&rsquo;s work may be 
gained by applying a variant of the same idea. According to this variant, which I shall 
pursue through the remainder of this essay, the struggle depicted in the first movement is 
<i>internal</i>: Beethoven&rsquo;s subconscious <i>denies</i> what his conscious self already 
knows, namely, that the Archduke&rsquo;s departure is imminent. This idea of an inner struggle, 
however, is more properly introduced through a brief psychological digression.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>

<h3>The Psychology of Loss</h3>

<p>[8] From a psychological and psychiatric standpoint, parting from someone we love is a 
particular case of a more general type of traumatic experience known as &ldquo;loss.&rdquo; 
As Judith Viorst has observed, &ldquo;we begin life with loss.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> More typically, however, loss is associated 
with such events as the loss of a bodily organ; divorce; and of course, death, be it of a 
family member, close friend, or a political or spiritual leader.</p><p>

[9] The psychology of loss probably manifests itself most clearly in the extreme case of 
one&rsquo;s own impending death. In her highly influential book, <i>On Death and Dying</i>, 
Elisabeth K&uuml;bler-Ross 
has proposed that dying patients pass through a progressive 
series of more or less pre-determined psychological states that include denial, anger, 
bargaining, depression, and acceptance.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Although the rigidity of K&uuml;bler-Ross&rsquo;s 
five-stage theory has been put to task, the importance of denial as a defense 
mechanism in a loss situation has not, so far as I am aware, been challenged.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> For example, one of 
K&uuml;bler-Ross&rsquo;s critics, Edwin Shneidman, asserts that &ldquo;one does not find a 
unidirectional movement through progressive stages so much as an alternation between 
acceptance and denial <nobr>. . .</nobr> This interplay <nobr>. . .</nobr> between understanding what is happening 
and magically disbelieving its reality, may reflect a deeper dialogue of the total mind, 
involving different layers of conscious awareness of &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; and of needing not to 
know.&ldquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p><p>

[10] In interpreting the first movement of Op. 81a as representing the &ldquo;alternation 
between acceptance and denial&rdquo; characteristic of the psychology of loss, it is perhaps 
significant to note that Archduke Rudolph&rsquo;s departure is not the only loss that Beethoven 
has suffered in 1809, either just before or during the period he composed the sonata. On 
February 19, for example, Beethoven&rsquo;s physician Johann Adam Schmidt died. The death of 
Dr. Schmidt, &ldquo;with whom he developed a strong personal bond,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> may have reactivated in 
Beethoven the trauma connected with one of his most painful losses, namely the loss of his 
hearing.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> The suicidal 
impulses connected with that loss are well documented in the famous &ldquo;Heiligenstadt 
testament&rdquo; of 1802. &ldquo;Lebt wohl,&rdquo; writes Beethoven in the testament, and 
in the postscript he adds: &ldquo;so nehme ich denn Abschied von dir&rdquo;; reverberating 
in Op. 81a, the words &ldquo;Lebewohl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Abschied&rdquo; thus acquire a 
particularly poignant quality.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p><p>

[11] On March 21, Julie von Vering, a woman to which Beethoven seems to have been 
attracted, died at age nineteen after marrying his friend Stephan von Breuning.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> This particular loss is perhaps 
symbolic of a more general one, namely Beethoven&rsquo;s self-imposed sacrifice of marital 
happiness for the sake of artistic freedom. Finally, on May 31, Joseph Haydn died. Haydn 
was possibly a father figure for Beethoven, and thus his death may have carried significant 
psychological undertones.</p><p>

[12] Before turning to a more detailed analysis of the first movement, I should like to briefly 
consider the entire sonata from the present psychological perspective.</p><p>

[13] Psychoanalysts have noted a connection between loss and creativity. Hanna Segal, for 
example, states that &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr> when the world within us is destroyed, when it is dead and 
loveless, when our loved ones are in fragments, and when we ourselves in helpless despair, 
it is then that we must re-create our world anew, reassemble the pieces, infuse life into dead 
fragments, re-create life.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> George Pollock has turned this idea into a 
thesis termed &ldquo;the mourning-liberation process,&rdquo; according to which &ldquo;the 
successful completion of the mourning process results in creative outcome.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Applying this idea to 
Beethoven&rsquo;s sonata, one may regard its first movement as depicting loss; the second 
mourning; and the third personal renewal. Thus seen, the sonata becomes a vehicle to one 
of Beethoven&rsquo;s favorite topics, namely the death of a hero and his subsequent 
resurrection.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> Indeed, there 
may be special significance to Beethoven&rsquo;s choice of the &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; E-flat major 
as the sonata&rsquo;s key.</p>

<h3>The Denial-Acceptance Axis: Three Representative Stages</h3>

<p>[14] The idea of a struggle between conscious awareness and subconscious denial is 
incorporated, I believe, into the pianistic fabric of the first movement. The sonata begins 
with the Lebewohl-motto in the right hand (see again Example 1). Like the word that Beethoven 
writes above it, the motto is essentially a conventional pattern, the significance of which 
may be accessed by purely intellectual means.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Thus the right hand may be seen as 
embodying Beethoven&rsquo;s conscious, rational side, the side that understands (to borrow 
Shneidman&rsquo;s phrase) &ldquo;what is happening.&rdquo; The left hand&mdash;traditionally carrying 
darker connotations (cf. the Latin <i>sinistra</i>)&mdash;assumes under the same interpretation 
Beethoven&rsquo;s subconscious, emotional side: it contradicts the right-hand&rsquo;s realistic stance (in 
&ldquo;magical disbelief,&rdquo; to paraphrase Shneidman again), with its striking entry on 
the downbeat of measure 2. In other words, the thought of Archduke Rudolph&rsquo;s departure, while 
rationally valid (see the right hand), is at this stage emotionally unacceptable (see the left hand).<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p><p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>.

<p>[15] It is most illuminating to turn in this connection to the movement&rsquo;s ending. In measure 243, 
following what may be regarded as the movement&rsquo;s structural cadence, the left hand begins 
a descent in whole-notes from great <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>; contra-G, reached in measure 248, is confirmed as the 
goal of this descent in measures 250 and 252. Since the initial great <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is held in the inner voice 
as pedal, upon reaching contra-G the descending sixth is expressed vertically as the dyad 
G-<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, the same dyad that concludes the Lebewohl-motto in measure 2 (whole-notes are typically 
associated with the Lebewohl-idea in the Allegro). The right-hand counterpoints the left-
hand&rsquo;s descent with an ascending scale figure whose high-point is an appoggiatura C; after 
resolving twice to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in half-note rhythm (measures 248 and 250), the appoggiatura figure is 
rhythmically expanded into whole-notes in measures 252&ndash;53 (see <b>Example 2</b>). Now, the combination 
of an octave C in the right hand with a minor-sixth G&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in the left amounts in measure 252 to an 
exact exchange of parts between the hands in relation to measure 2. Attributing the same 
psychological content to each hand as in measures 1&ndash;2, and given that the dyad G&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is now 
taken by the left hand, and moreover is placed low in the bass register, one might say that 
the painful idea of Rudolph&rsquo;s departure has been by this stage accepted by Beethoven&rsquo;s 
psyche, down to its innermost, deepest strata. With an exquisite ironic touch, the note C, so 
strikingly disruptive when taken by the left hand in measure 2, is turned in measures 248&ndash;53 by the 
right hand into a harmless appoggiatura.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup></p>

<p>[16] Between these two extreme stages of downright denial (measures 1&ndash;2, and their 
chromatically intensified repetition in measures 7&ndash;8) and equally unconditioned acceptance (measures 
243&ndash;55), several intermediate stages, I believe, may be detected. In the following section I 
shall consider the bridge sections (exposition and recapitulation), the development section, 
and, of course, the highly important and deservedly celebrated coda. Here I should like to 
consider the second subject, which seems to represent a stage lying comfortably near the 
middle of our imaginary denial-acceptance axis. To facilitate comparison with the 
movement&rsquo;s beginning and end, I shall consider the second subject as it appears in the 
recapitulation, that is, in the home-key of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major.</p><p>

[17] The second subject consists of two four-measure groups, measures 142&ndash;45 and 146&ndash;150, 
the second of which is essentially a transposition down an octave of the first. In each four-
measure group the Lebewohl-motive is stated twice: in whole-notes at the beginning of the 
group, and in quarter-notes near the end (in measure 145 the quarter-note motion G&ndash;F is not 
followed by an <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> due to the new beginning on G in measure 146).</p><p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b>.

<p>[18] Weakened resistance to the idea of departure is suggested, I believe, in the disruption 
of closure on the downbeat of measure 150: a weakened version of the deceptive cadence of measure 2 
(see <b>Example 3a</b>). Indeed, the augmented <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;G&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> of measure 150 (first half) is analogous 
to the VI and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>VI chords of measures 2 and 8: a sixth G(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>)&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in the upper voices is 
accompanied by C(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>). Unlike measures 2 and 8, however, where C(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) is given to the bass 
(resulting in a consonant, root-position triad), in measure 150 <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is given to an inner voice, 
which lends it a much less stable quality; and sure enough, stability is soon restored, for in 
the second half of the same measure the disruptive <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is revealed as a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; 
upper neighbor to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. If one isolates measures 2 and 8; measure 150; and measure 252 from the rest of the 
movement (<b>Example 3b</b>), one sees an interesting process by which C(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) &ldquo;migrates&rdquo; 
from the bass, first to an inner voice, and ultimately to the top voice. Since the three 
positions of the C(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) are progressively less threatening to the stability of the accompanying 
G(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>)&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> dyad, the process as a whole makes a fascinating analogue to a gradual 
psychological transition from a state of denial to one of acceptance.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup></p>

<p>[19] But why, one may ask, is closure disrupted on the downbeat of measure 150, rather than 
(say) measures 144 or 148, that also conclude a statement of the Lebewohl-motive? The answer, 
I believe, concerns register. Observe the return to the one-line register in measures 149&ndash;50, 
actually the first time in the Allegro that the motto (upper part only) is heard in its original 
key <i>and</i> register. Register is an important issue in the movement, given the obvious 
way in which the motto imitates the sound of two natural horns (thus the Lebewohl-motto, 
in a strict sense, is <i>register-specific</i>, an idea to which I shall return in connection 
with the coda). All the same, I am inclined to view the left-hand&rsquo;s biting, syncopated 
dissonances accompanying the right-hand&rsquo;s Lebewohl-motive in measures 142&ndash;44 and 146&ndash;48 as 
yet another manifestation of (weakened) resistance to the idea of departure.</p>

<p>[20] Generally in this sonata, there is a tendency to avoid sharp formal boundaries, and thus 
the traditional categories of first subject, transition, etc., must be applied with some caution. 
For example, a large-scale harmonic cycle T&ndash;S&ndash;D&ndash;T overlaps the onset of the Allegro in measure 
17, where the sonata&rsquo;s first subject would seem to begin.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> Note that measure 21 contains the first stable 
tonic chord in the movement, not counting the harmony implicit in measure 1. Since measure 25, also 
containing a root-position tonic, merely initiates a varied repetition of measures 21&ndash;24, I shall 
take measure 21 as the bridge-section&rsquo;s harmonic point of origin. In what follows I shall propose 
that much of the bridge section is based on an enlargement of the Lebewohl-motive G&ndash;F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 
in the upper voice. A comparison with the parallel passage in the recapitulation should help 
confirm such a reading.</p><p>

<p>[21] <b>Figure 1</b> compares measures 
21&ndash;50 (exposition) with measures 114&ndash;42 (recapitulation) at a 
background level (there is no Lebewohl-motive at this level). Note that while a soprano 
progression, G&ndash;F, is common to both passages, the accompanying bass progression is quite 
different. In the exposition, the underlying bass motion is of a rising second <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (I) to F 
(V/V); the half-diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord of measure 36 provides an important melodic and harmonic 
link between these two referential events. In the recapitulation, on the other hand, the bass 
rises a fifth from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (I) to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (V); here the half-diminished <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> (measure 128) is part of the rising-fifth progression.</p><p>

[22] In <b>Figure 2</b> lower-level 
details are added. Note that in both passages Beethoven composes 
a large scale voice-exchange between soprano and bass: G&ndash;F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (the Lebewohl-motive) in 
the soprano is set against <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;F&ndash;G(<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) in the bass (I read an implied F in the bass in both the 
exposition and recapitulation underneath the same F-major <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 3" src="../../gifs/63.gif" width="8" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord). Nonetheless, these 
two voice exchanges have an altogether different effect. Although in both exposition and 
recapitulation registral unity is lacking, in the recapitulation we have a single underlying 
key (<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> major), a smooth harmonic progression connecting two stable harmonic events (I and <nobr>I<sup>6</sup></nobr>), and a more-or-less unified texture (the texture changes abruptly with the half-diminished sonority of measure 127, where a new subphrase begins). In the exposition, on the 
other hand, there is no single underlying key, and the harmonic progression is anything but 
smooth (especially in measures 34&ndash;5); moreover, the progression ends with an unstable, 
dissonant event (the half-diminished sonority), which functions on the surface as a new 
beginning more than an end. As a result, although a large-scale Lebewohl-progression (G&ndash;F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>) unifies the upper voice, this unity is undermined by several factors, and especially by 
the dissonant, explosive event in measure 35. Thus the bridge section in the exposition may be 
interpreted as representing another instance of denial, denial that assumes a decidedly 
angry, even violent character.</p><p>

[23] I find the development section, harmonically one of the most daring Beethoven ever 
composed, rather enigmatic. Nonetheless, from the rhythmic, textural, and pianistic 
standpoints the development seems to coalesce around the contrast between long notes 
(representing the Lebewohl-idea) in the right hand, and a restless &ldquo;anapest&rdquo; 
rhythm, clearly derived from the first subject, in the left hand (measures 73&ndash;90; 94&ndash;108). I would 
suggest that this contrast once again represents an inner struggle between acceptance (right 
hand) and denial (left hand). In measures 98&ndash;103, in particular, the anapest rhythm in the left 
hand is identified with the note C, thus linking the first subject with the left-hand&rsquo;s entry in 
measure 2.</p><p>

<p>[24] Measures 181&ndash;97 of the coda (see <b>Example 4</b>) is one of several passages in the movement that 
employ the Lebewohl-motive in imitation between the hands (in all of these passages the 
right hand leads while the left hand follows).<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> In the coda, the imitated Lebewohl-
motive corresponds rhythmically to the original Lebewohl-motto of measures 1&ndash;2 (tonally, 
however, only the contour of a descending third is preserved). Here, as in the earlier 
passages, it is significant that the left hand does not contradict the right hand, but to the 
contrary, confirms its (quasi) Lebewohl-pronunciations through imitation.</p>

<p>[25] The Lebewohl-idea in its original form dominates the remainder of the coda. It is 
interesting to compare measures 197&ndash;201 with the second subject (specifically, measures 146&ndash;50), 
from which they obviously derive (<b>Example 5</b>). Except for register (measures 197&ndash;99) or rhythm (measures 
200&ndash;201), the Lebewohl-idea in the right hand assumes in measures 197&ndash;201 its original form (in 
measures 146&ndash;50, by comparison, the sense of a horn-duo is lacking). Note further that unlike measure 
150 there is no deceptive ending in measure 201&mdash;i.e., no (weakened) denial&mdash;and moreover, the 
left hand in measures 197&ndash;99 accompanies with florid counterpoint, rather than syncopated 
dissonances (cf. measures 146&ndash;47), the right-hand&rsquo;s cantus-firmus-like motto. However, lack of 
denial is not quite the same as acceptance. When the right and left hands exchange parts 
beginning in measure 201 (a type of imitative technique), the left hand is &ldquo;unable&rdquo; to 
follow the right-hand&rsquo;s previous example and leaves the Lebewohl-motto consistently 
incomplete (<b>Example 6</b>). The entire passage is repeated beginning in measure 209, as if to give the left 
hand a second chance; this is of no avail, however.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p>

<p>[26] Given the left-hand&rsquo;s apparent difficulty in &ldquo;pronouncing&rdquo; the entire 
Lebewohl-motto in its original form, a step-by-step, &ldquo;repeat-after-me&rdquo; type of 
learning process follows (measures 223&ndash;31). The motto is broken into its component parts, i.e., 
&ldquo;second horn&rdquo; and &ldquo;first horn&rdquo;; following the right-hand&rsquo;s example, 
the left hand imitates the second-horn part first, and only then attempts, for the first time in 
the entire movement, the entire motto in two parts (<b>Example 7</b>). Surprisingly, however, precisely 
as the left hand is finally about to succeed, the right hand enters with a rhythmically 
distorted version of the motto. The right hand&rsquo;s entry, initiating the celebrated imitative 
passage that superimposes tonic and dominant harmonies, does not seem to make much 
sense in view of the present interpretation. Why should the right hand, which presumably 
represents Beethoven&rsquo;s conscious, rational side, interfere with the left hand at this critical 
juncture, that is, interfere with the process by which Beethoven&rsquo;s emotional, subconscious 
side learns to accept the painful reality of Rudolph&rsquo;s departure?</p>


<p>[27] In answering this difficult question, let me begin with some purely musical 
considerations. As commentators have not failed to observe, the superimposed harmonies 
of measures 230&ndash;34 result from a logical compositional process by which the durational distance 
that separates statement (right hand) from imitation (left hand) is shortened from two 
measures to one. A glance at <b>Example 8</b>&mdash;a hypothetical version of measures 229&ndash;35&mdash;reveals that the 
motto&rsquo;s rhythmic distortion serves a number of purposes (in Example 8 the distortion is revoked). 
First, by shifting the motto&rsquo;s initial dyad to an unaccented position in the measure the 
overall dissonant effect is weakened; second, the distortion calls for only two pairs of horns 
(as opposed to more than two pairs in Example 8), and moreover, preserves the one-to-one 
correspondence between the horn-pairs and the pianist&rsquo;s hands; third, the upbeat entry in measure 
230 clarifies the hypermeter; and finally, the distortion ensures that the right hand is still 
heard as the leader, even as the imitative texture becomes considerably more dense.</p>

<p>[28] It is this last point, I believe, that gives us a clue towards solving the question posed 
earlier. Note that since the right hand states the Lebewohl-motto in its original register in 
measures 227&ndash;29 (see again Example 7), the left hand is forced to imitate one octave lower. But 
register, we have already noted, is integral to the motto&rsquo;s identity. <i>The left hand must 
state the Lebewohl-motto in its original register in order for acceptance to be complete</i>. 
The right hand&rsquo;s surprising entry in measure 230 reflects, as it were, this last minute realization: 
an important ingredient is still missing so as to make the left-hand&rsquo;s Lebewohl-statement an 
authentic token of acceptance. Indeed, in measures 232&ndash;34 the right hand states the (distorted) 
motto an octave higher than before; following the right-hand&rsquo;s lead the left hand makes the 
corresponding adjustment, thus finally stating the Lebewohl-motto in its 
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; registral position (measures 233&ndash;35).</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 9</b>. Measures 235&ndash;238</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="agmon_examples.php?id=10&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 9 thumbnail" src="agmon_ex9_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>
<p>[29] Note the exquisite touch by which the right hand begins yet another Lebewohl-
statement, in a still higher register, on the last beat of measure 234. As if suddenly realizing its 
mistake, the right hand aborts the attempted statement; a rest on the downbeat of measure 235 
prevents a dominant/tonic clash similar to measure 231 from taking place. The imitative passage 
that follows in measures 235&ndash;38 (<b>Example 9</b>) serves to confirm, as it were, the state of equilibrium that 
has been finally achieved within Beethoven&rsquo;s psyche: both rationally and emotionally, the 
idea of Rudolph&rsquo;s departure has been absorbed.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> Following the brief codetta, measures 243&ndash;55, 
which further confirms that loss has been indeed accepted (review the discussion in 
paragraph 15), we enter a new psychological phase, mourning, in the second 
movement.</p>

<p>[30] &ldquo;Written from the heart,&rdquo; states Beethoven in the sketches to Op. 81a. 
Perhaps the present essay should give a new meaning to this simple yet touching phrase. 
Transcending its immediate, personal context, Op. 81a depicts with uncanny insight the 
inner workings of the human psyche as it copes with one of the most basic signatures of the 
human condition: the experience of loss.</p>

have been inspired by Beethoven&rsquo;s love to Therese von Brunswick more than his friendship 
to Rudolph. Adolph Bernhard Marx (who was possibly ignorant of the work&rsquo;s biographical 
background) similarly believed that the sonata depicted &ldquo;moments from the life of a 
loving [opposite-sex] couple&rdquo;; see his <i>Anleitung zum Vortrag Beethovenscher 
Klavierwerke</i>, ed. by Eugen Schmitz (Regensburg: Gustav Bosse, ca. 1912; orig. ed. 
Berlin, 1863), page 218. While it is doubtful that Beethoven would have made public the 
sentiments expressed in Op. 81a had he suspected that these could be interpreted in a 
homosexual light, at least from a present-day perspective the work&rsquo;s homo-erotic 
undertones cannot altogether be dismissed. These undertones, however, are totally beside 
the point as far as the present interpretation of the sonata is concerned.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> Anton Rubinstein, <i>A Conversation on Music</i>, trans. by Mrs.

Uhde has remarked (<i>Beethovens Klaviermusik</i>, page 279), &ldquo;the fervent activity 
that the Allegro displays after this Adagio-&lsquo;Introduction&rsquo; may have striked a naive observer 
as rather strange.&rdquo; Subsequently in the same paragraph he explains that &ldquo;in the 
entire sonata the contrast between deliberation and determination, between hesitant question 
and definite answer, repeats itself again and again.&rdquo; See also Nagel&rsquo;s 
(<i>Beethoven</i>, pages 167&ndash;68) sharp critique of A. B. Marx&rsquo;s attempt to see the Allegro in 
a passionate light. Nagel is evidently disturbed by the Allegro&rsquo;s apparent programmatic 
inappropriateness, for in the same paragraph he rationalizes (cf. Uhde) that 
&ldquo;[Beethoven] never surrendered himself to a painful thought for long, and from the

which the G&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> dyad is unstable is rendered (following the deceptive cadence) doubly

&ldquo;G versus <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&rdquo;). See Heinrich Schenker, <i>Free Composition</i>, Figure 119/7 
and its discussion on page 100 of the main text; and William Rothstein, &ldquo;Heinrich

18. Uhde (<i>Beethovens Klaviermusik</i>, page 282) makes the interesting proposition that 
measures 35&ndash;50, rather than measures 50&ndash;58, are the sonata&rsquo;s second subject (Uhde considers measures 
50&ndash;58 as the exposition&rsquo;s closing group).<br><a href="#FN30REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN31">31.</a> The first passage of this type occurs already near the end of the 
exposition (measures 62&ndash;65); as several commentators have noted, the passage (restated in the 
recapitulation, measures 154&ndash;57) makes use of rhythmic diminution. In a broad sense, the idea 
of the left hand following the right hand originates from the very beginning of the 
movement, where the left hand enters after a full-measure rest.<br><a href="#FN31REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN32">32.</a> Schenker&rsquo;s implied <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in the left hand in measure 207 is of course 
technically correct, yet nonetheless seems to miss the point. See <i>Free Composition</i>, 
Figure 125/5 (the figure illustrates &ldquo;deceptive intervals&rdquo; that arise from keyboard 
writing). The pianistically awkward note-repetitions in measures 219 and 221 seem to support 
the idea that Beethoven&rsquo;s B-flats have special significance, since these repetitions could 
have been easily remedied by resorting to the implied <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. Although a crossing of the voices 
would have resulted in the process, such a voice crossing is pianistically less awkward than 
repetition.<br><a href="#FN32REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN33">33.</a> Or, in terms of an external struggle (cf. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Capriccio</i>),

158).</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">See Beethoven&rsquo;s letter to Breitkopf &amp; H&auml;rtel dated Sept. 
23 [1810], in <i>Ludwig van Beethovens s&auml;mtliche Briefe</i>, ed. by Emerich 
Kastner and Dr. Julius Kapp (Tutzing: Hans Schneider, 1975; orig. ed. 1923), page 
179.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Cf. Jacques-Gabriel Prod&rsquo;homme (<i>Les Sonates pour Piano de 
Beethoven</i>, page 202), who suggests (apparently after Charles Malherbe) that Op. 81a may 
have been inspired by Beethoven&rsquo;s love to Therese von Brunswick more than his friendship 
to Rudolph. Adolph Bernhard Marx (who was possibly ignorant of the work&rsquo;s biographical 
background) similarly believed that the sonata depicted &ldquo;moments from the life of a 
loving [opposite-sex] couple&rdquo;; see his <i>Anleitung zum Vortrag Beethovenscher 
Klavierwerke</i>, ed. by Eugen Schmitz (Regensburg: Gustav Bosse, ca. 1912; orig. ed. 
Berlin, 1863), page 218. While it is doubtful that Beethoven would have made public the 
sentiments expressed in Op. 81a had he suspected that these could be interpreted in a 
homosexual light, at least from a present-day perspective the work&rsquo;s homo-erotic 
undertones cannot altogether be dismissed. These undertones, however, are totally beside 
the point as far as the present interpretation of the sonata is concerned.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Anton Rubinstein, <i>A Conversation on Music</i>, trans. by Mrs. 
John P. Morgan (New York: Da Capo, 1982; orig. English ed. New York, 1892), page 9. As 
Uhde has remarked (<i>Beethovens Klaviermusik</i>, page 279), &ldquo;the fervent activity 
that the Allegro displays after this Adagio-&lsquo;Introduction&rsquo; may have striked a naive observer 
as rather strange.&rdquo; Subsequently in the same paragraph he explains that &ldquo;in the 
entire sonata the contrast between deliberation and determination, between hesitant question 
and definite answer, repeats itself again and again.&rdquo; See also Nagel&rsquo;s 
(<i>Beethoven</i>, pages 167&ndash;68) sharp critique of A. B. Marx&rsquo;s attempt to see the Allegro in 
a passionate light. Nagel is evidently disturbed by the Allegro&rsquo;s apparent programmatic 
inappropriateness, for in the same paragraph he rationalizes (cf. Uhde) that 
&ldquo;[Beethoven] never surrendered himself to a painful thought for long, and from the 
deepest emotional distress the strength for action arose in him.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Explaining Music: Essays and Explorations</i> (Berkeley: 
University of California Press, 1973), page 243. Meyer presents a detailed analysis of the first 
movement (especially the opening twenty-one measures), and lays considerable emphasis 
on the structural implications of the deceptive cadence of measure 2. According to 
Blumr&ouml;der (in Riethm&uuml;ller et al., <i>Beethoven: Interpretationen</i>, page 630), 
the deceptive cadence carries &ldquo;a specific emotional quality of uncertainty&rdquo; 
(&ldquo;eine spezifische Empfindungsqualit&auml;t der Ungewissheit&rdquo;).</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid., 244. See also Uhde, page 272. Uhde points out that the sonata 
as a whole begins with an ending (departure), and ends with a new beginning (reunion), an 
idea that he develops into a thesis of contrasting experiences in the time dimension; see pages 
272&ndash;75.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Blom, page 182; Richard Rosenberg, <i>Die Klaviersonaten Ludwig 
van Beethovens</i>, vol. 2 (Olten: URS Graf-Verlag, 1957), page 325; Uhde, page 279. 
However, I am not aware of any documentary evidence from which Beethoven&rsquo;s familiarity 
with Bach&rsquo;s youthful work may be inferred.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Bach&rsquo;s inscription for the first movement is: &ldquo;Adagio. Ist 
eine Schmeichelung der Freunde, um denselben von seiner Reise 
abzuhalten.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Kenneth Drake, <i>The Beethoven Sonatas and the Creative 
Experience</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1994), page 69.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">I realize that some readers may feel uncomfortable with the idea of 
an inner, psychological struggle, and might prefer an interpretation of Op. 81a more on the 
lines of Bach&rsquo;s <i>Capriccio</i>. For such readers, the following section is optional. As for 
the remainder of this essay, the terms of an inner struggle (i.e., denying the reality of 
Rudolph&rsquo;s imminent departure) may be easily translated into those of an external struggle 
(preventing the Archduke&rsquo;s departure from taking place).</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Judith Viorst, <i>Necessary Losses</i> (New York: Ballantine

Beethoven enacted his own death and resurrection in the Heiligenstadt episode. &ldquo;He 
recreated himself in a new guise, self-sufficient and heroic. The testament is a funeral work, 
. . . in a sense it is the literary prototype of the Eroica Symphony, . . . a daydream 
compounded of heroism, death, and rebirth. . .&rdquo; See also Uhde&rsquo;s (<i>Beethovens 
Klaviermusik</i>, pages 275&ndash;76) characterization of the sonata&rsquo;s three movements (especially 
the third movement), as well as his comments on pages 271&ndash;72 in favour of a 
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; interpretation of the sonata&rsquo;s program.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">Uhde (<i>Beethovens Klaviermusik</i>, pages 277&ndash;78), 
characterizes the Lebewohl-motto as a &ldquo;Tatsache-Motive&rdquo;: an unchallengeable, 
factual, objective statement.</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">In &ldquo;<i>Auf dem Flusse</i>: Image and Background in a 
Schubert Song,&rdquo; <i>19th Century Music</i> 6:1 (1982), 47&ndash;59, David Lewin 
employs a somewhat similar idea of &ldquo;textural segregation.&rdquo; See especially Figure 
5 and its discussion on pages 56&ndash;7. Another point of contact with Lewin&rsquo;s essay is 
psychological. According to Lewin, the poet in Schubert&rsquo;s setting suppresses a painful 
question. Suppression (or repression) and denial are related psychological operations.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">Pointing out that Beethoven&rsquo;s crescendo in measures 252&ndash;53 contradicts the &ldquo;sigh&rdquo; implications of the C&ndash;B&#x266d; motive (cf. measures 248 and 250), William Rothstein (private communication) suggests that Beethoven is portraying a change from sighing grief into manly resolve. For more on the conventional &ldquo;sigh&rdquo; motive in this movement, see Rothstein&rsquo;s sensitive discussion of Op. 81a in &ldquo;Heinrich Schenker as an Interpreter of Beethoven&rsquo;s Piano Sonatas,&rdquo; <i>19th Century 
Music</i> 8:1 (1984), pages 12&ndash;13. Heinrich Schenker [<i>Free Composition</i>, trans. and ed. by Ernst Oster (New York: Longman, 1979), page 64 of the main text] views the two-note sequence A&#x266d;1&ndash;G1, A&#x266d;2&ndash;G2, F1&ndash;E&#x266d;1, E&#x266d;2&ndash;D&#x266d;2, D&#x266d;2&ndash;C2, C2&ndash;C&#x266d;2, and C&#x266d;2&ndash;B&#x266d;1 (measures 66&ndash;86&mdash;see Schenker&rsquo;s Figure 62/4), as representing statements of the Lebewohl-motto, shortened 
by one syllable. &ldquo;The third syllable is lost&rdquo; he states, &ldquo;as though in a 
sob.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">Concerning the G&ndash;E&#x266d; dyad, it is perhaps significant that the C&ndash;
minor  chord on the downbeats of measures 4 and 5 is represented by G and E&#x266d; only (note 
also the right-hand&rsquo;s melodic minor sixth G&ndash;E&#x266d; on the last eighth of measure 4). The sense in 
which the G&ndash;E&#x266d; dyad is unstable is rendered (following the deceptive cadence) doubly 
acute. A significant compositional issue in the movement is &ldquo;C versus C&#x266d;&rdquo; (or 
&ldquo;G versus G&#x266d;&rdquo;). See Heinrich Schenker, <i>Free Composition</i>, Figure 119/7 
and its discussion on page 100 of the main text; and William Rothstein, &ldquo;Heinrich 
Schenker as an Interpreter of Beethoven&rsquo;s Piano Sonatas,&rdquo; pages 12&ndash;13 and 17. </div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">I read a prolongation of IV from measure 11 (second half) through measure 
18. Uhde (<i>Beethovens Klaviermusik</i>, page 282) makes the interesting proposition that 
measures 35&ndash;50, rather than measures 50&ndash;58, are the sonata&rsquo;s second subject (Uhde considers measures 
50&ndash;58 as the exposition&rsquo;s closing group).</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">The first passage of this type occurs already near the end of the 
exposition (measures 62&ndash;65); as several commentators have noted, the passage (restated in the 
recapitulation, measures 154&ndash;57) makes use of rhythmic diminution. In a broad sense, the idea 
of the left hand following the right hand originates from the very beginning of the 
movement, where the left hand enters after a full-measure rest.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">Schenker&rsquo;s implied E&#x266d; in the left hand in measure 207 is of course 
technically correct, yet nonetheless seems to miss the point. See <i>Free Composition</i>, 
Figure 125/5 (the figure illustrates &ldquo;deceptive intervals&rdquo; that arise from keyboard 
writing). The pianistically awkward note-repetitions in measures 219 and 221 seem to support 
the idea that Beethoven&rsquo;s B-flats have special significance, since these repetitions could 
have been easily remedied by resorting to the implied E&#x266d;. Although a crossing of the voices 
would have resulted in the process, such a voice crossing is pianistically less awkward than 
repetition.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">Or, in terms of an external struggle (cf. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Capriccio</i>), 
at this point Beethoven finally allows Rudolph to depart. Interestingly, measures 239&ndash;43 are 
traditionally interpreted as depicting the withdrawal of the Archduke&rsquo;s coach.</div>
