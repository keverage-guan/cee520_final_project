Standard formulas for permutations and combinations may be used to enumerate melodies, rhythms, rows, pitch-class sets, and other familiar musical entities subject to various constraints on their structure. Some music scholars in the eighteenth century advocated elementary combinatorial methods, including dice games, as aids in composition. Problems involving the enumeration of set classes, row classes, and other types of equivalence classes are more difficult and require advanced techniques for their solution, notably P&oacute;lya&#8217;s Enumeration Theorem. Such techniques are applicable in a wide variety of situations, enabling the enumeration of diverse musical structures in scales of various cardinalities and under various definitions of equivalence relations.</font></p>

&nbsp;</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 1</b>. Enumeration of mod-12 pitch-class sets and <i>T<sub>n</sub></i>/<i>T<sub>n</sub>I</i> set classes</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="hook_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 1 thumbnail" src="hook_table1_small.gif"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[1] <b>Table 1</b> gives the number of pitch-class sets and the number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> set 
classes of each cardinality from 0 through 12. The number of different pc-sets 
of cardinality <i><i>k</i></i>, appearing in the central row of the table, may be calculated 
by a well-known formula (to be reviewed below) for &#8220;the number of combinations 
of 12 things <i><i>k</i></i> at a time.&#8221; The set-class counts in the bottom row are familiar 
to music theorists not by means of a formula, but through the widespread use of 
tables enumerating all the set classes. Such tables appear, for example, in 
<a href="#forte_1973" id="citation_forte_1973_67dc9b0edd78d">Forte 1973</a>, <a href="#rahn_1980" id="citation_rahn_1980_67dc9b0edd793">Rahn 1980</a>, <a href="#morris_1987" id="citation_morris_1987_67dc9b0edd796">Morris 1987</a>and <a href="#morris_1991" id="citation_morris_1991_67dc9b0edd79b">1991</a>, and <a href="#straus_2005" id="citation_straus_2005_67dc9b0edd79e">Straus 2005</a>, among various other texts.</p>

<p>[2] The formula giving the number of set classes&#8212;if indeed there is such a formula 
at all&#8212;is not an obvious one. On reflection, some aspects of these numbers may 
even seem somewhat counterintuitive. We might expect that when we count 
something governed by a high degree of symmetry, such as the number of different 
types of four-element subsets of a twelve-element set, we should end up with a 
&#8220;round&#8221; number&#8212;probably a number with many divisors, such as 24, 30, or 36. The 
fact that the number of tetrachord types turns out to be 29&#8212;a number not only 
odd but prime&#8212;challenges this intuition and suggests that the enumeration 
question may be deeper or more difficult than we imagined.</p>

<p>[3] <a href="#bernard_1997" id="citation_bernard_1997_67dc9b0edd7a1">Bernard 1997</a> and <a href="#nolan_2003" id="citation_nolan_2003_67dc9b0edd7a4">Nolan 2003</a> show that pitch-class sets and set classes have been 
effectively enumerated in various ways dating back at least to the late 
nineteenth century. In general, though, the music scholars who have carried out 
this exercise have not pursued mathematical explanations for the numbers 
appearing in the bottom row of Table 1. That is, they have not attempted to 
calculate the <i>number</i> of set classes except by exhaustively <i>listing</i> all of the 
set classes&#8212;a process akin to the White Queen&#8217;s way of &#8220;doing addition&#8221; in the 
quotation above.</p>

<p>[4] Beyond simple curiosity, a further motivation for exploring the mathematics 
behind set-class enumeration is its potential for generalization. If we develop 
a formula that explains why there are 29 tetrachords, that formula will likely 
be applicable in a variety of other situations: other cardinalities of set 
(besides 4), other cardinalities of the underlying scale (besides 12), other 
definitions of &#8220;set class&#8221; (besides the usual one based on <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> equivalence), 
and perhaps enumeration problems of entirely different sorts, involving 
twelve-tone rows or rhythms, for example. Listing and counting all the mod-12 
set classes is feasible but already somewhat unwieldy, as the multi-page lengths 
of the tabulations cited above reveal; it is not hard to devise similar problems 
for which the numbers involved are much larger and the exhaustive approach 
becomes impractical.</p>

<p>[5] This article is organized in two parts. Part I, which might be subtitled &#8220;What 
every music theorist should know about combinatorics,&#8221; offers a primer on 
standard techniques in classical combinatorial theory (including the 
&#8220;combinations&#8221; formula mentioned above) and offers some simple applications to 
music theory (including the enumeration of pitch-class sets) and historical 
notes (including a brief overview of the <i><i>ars combinatoria</i></i> that found its way 
into eighteenth-century musical discourse). The computational methods of Part I 
are familiar to every mathematician and will be familiar as well to many readers 
of this article. I believe it is useful to include this crash course here 
because, even though the mathematics involved is elementary, it has never become 
a part of the standard music theorist&#8217;s toolbox and has seldom if ever been 
given a unified presentation oriented toward musical applications. Moreover, the 
elementary techniques covered in Part I foreshadow certain aspects of the more 
difficult work of Part II, and therefore may form a pedagogically beneficial 
bridge to the advanced material.</p>

<p>[6] The general problem of set-class enumeration, as intimated above, turns out to 
require mathematical techniques of substantial power and sophistication. Some of 
the appropriate methodology was not developed until well into the twentieth 
century; the most important theoretical result, P&oacute;lya&#8217;s Enumeration Theorem, was 
first published in <a href="#p&oacute;lya_1937" id="citation_p&oacute;lya_1937_67dc9b0edd7c7">1937</a>. Part II is devoted to an exploration of some of these 
advanced techniques and their music-theoretic applications. Here at last the 
numbers in the bottom row of Table 1 will find their theoretical justification, 
and a variety of other musical problems amenable to the same techniques will be 
discussed.</p>

<p>[7] It should be acknowledged at the outset that most of the results in this 
article, even those in Part II, are not new. Applications of P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem to 
the set-class enumeration problem and other musical situations may be found in 
<a href="#reiner_1985" id="citation_reiner_1985_67dc9b0edd7cb">Reiner 1985</a>, <a href="#fripertinger_1992_1993" id="citation_fripertinger_1992_1993_67dc9b0edd7cf">Fripertinger 1992, 1993</a> and <a href="#fripertinger_1999" id="citation_fripertinger_1999_67dc9b0edd7d4">1999</a>, <a href="#read_1997" id="citation_read_1997_67dc9b0edd7d7">Read 1997</a>, <a href="#jedrzejewski_2006" id="citation_jedrzejewski_2006_67dc9b0edd7d9">Jedrzejewski 2006</a>, and <a href="#benson_2007" id="citation_benson_2007_67dc9b0edd7dc">Benson 2007</a>. Most music theorists, however, would likely find these sources 
impenetrable, as all of them demand considerable mathematical fluency of the 
reader. I hope in this article to provide an exposition that will be more 
readily accessible to the music theory community. The mathematical discourse 
will have to be ratcheted up a notch in Part II, where some basic group theory 
will be assumed, but on the whole the most important mathematical prerequisite 
for this article is a simple willingness to jump in and get one&#8217;s hands dirty.</p>
<h3 align="center">I. Elementary Techniques</h3>

<p>[8] <i>1.1. Combinatorics.</i> If a five-person committee is to be appointed from a group 
of eleven people, how many different committees are possible? In how many 
different ways can the six faces of a cube be painted if each face is to be a 
solid color, four colors are available, and all possible rotations of one 
painted cube are considered the same? Given a map showing a network of 
intersecting roads across the state of Texas, in how many ways can one travel 
from Galveston to Amarillo without crossing one&#8217;s path? These are some of the 
questions addressed by the branch of mathematics known as <i>combinatorics</i>. 
Combinatorics is essentially the study of methods of <i>counting</i>&#8212;enumerating all 
the objects of a certain description, all the ways in which a certain task can 
be performed, or all possible outcomes of a certain series of actions.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>

<p>[9] The most obvious way to find out how many objects of a certain type there are is 
the White Queen&#8217;s method: count them, one by one by one. Of course, people have 
been counting things for thousands of years. Listing and counting a large number 
of possibilities, however, is inefficient, prone to error, and in many 
situations completely impractical (although of course computers have redefined 
what we mean by &#8220;practical&#8221;). Moreover, it is mathematically unrevealing. In 
comparison with a method that tells us that the answer to a certain problem is 1 
+ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, a procedure that gives a formula such as 
2 &#0183; 5 or 5 &#0183; 4 / 2, or possibly 4 + 3 + 2 + 1, is likely to be both more reliable 
and more enlightening: it will not only tell us that the answer is 10, but will 
also offer some insight into why it should be 10 rather than 9 or 11, may convey 
a helpful visual interpretation of the calculation, and also may suggest answers 
or approaches to other similar problems. It may be said, therefore, that 
combinatorics is not so much the study of counting as the study of how to <i>avoid</i> 
counting: the search for more revealing and more efficient approaches to 
problems of enumeration that could, at least in principle, be solved by brute 
force.</p>

<p>[10] Not surprisingly, some of the earliest recorded mathematics involves questions 
of enumeration. Combinatorial problems are presented and solved (along with 
problems in algebra and simple arithmetic) in the Rhind Papyrus, an Egyptian 
document dating from about 1650 BCE but apparently copied from even older 
sources. Such problems also interested Pingala, an Indian mathematician of the 
third century BCE; Sun Zi (Sun Tzu), a Chinese mathematician of approximately 
the third century CE; and Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci), writing around 1200.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<p>[11] Problems in combinatorics are often easy to state and to understand but 
deceptively difficult to solve. Combinatorics has consequently attracted the 
attention of some of the greatest minds in mathematics, but has also exerted a 
powerful appeal on many mathematical amateurs. Such is the allure of the 
discipline that is has often been extolled as an art, known by the Latin name 
<i>ars combinatoria</i>. <i>Ars combinatoria</i> is, in fact, the name of a journal of 
combinatorics, and <i>De arte combinatoria</i> is the title of a 1666 treatise by 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646&#8211;1716), who is remembered especially for his 
pioneering work in calculus but who also spearheaded a renewed interest in 
combinatorial theory among leading European mathematicians in the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. Among the parade of other celebrated mathematicians 
who devised powerful combinatorial techniques may be found Blaise Pascal 
(1623&#8211;62), forever associated with the triangle (discussed below) that bears his 
name, though he was not the first to construct it; Jacob Bernoulli <nobr>(1654&#8211;1705),</nobr>
a follower of Leibniz and one of the most notable members of a family that was 
to produce no fewer than ten distinguished mathematicians; Leonhard Euler 
(1707&#8211;1783), whose astonishingly broad range of achievements not only forged 
connections between combinatorics and other branches of mathematics but even 
ventured into music (Euler constructed a version of what we now know as the 
Riemannian <i>Tonnetz</i>); and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749&#8211;1827), who among his many 
and varied accomplishments pioneered the study of probability, which is 
intimately connected to combinatorics.</p>

<p>[12] Combinatorial problems typically involve small numbers of objects that give rise 
to large numbers of possible configurations through combinations of various 
kinds. Music offers a clear illustration: though there may be only a small 
number of notes and durations to work with, the variety of ways in which a 
composer may combine them into a musical composition is enormous. Loosely 
speaking, the main reason for the proliferation of possibilities is what we may 
call the <i>multiplication principle</i>: if several choices are made independently, or 
several events happen in succession, the numbers of possibilities at the various 
stages are <i>multiplied</i> (not added as beginning students of the subject sometimes 
mistakenly assume). This simple principle suffices to solve a wide variety of 
enumeration problems; we offer a few musical illustrations.</p>
<p>[13]
<i>1.2. Example: simple melodies</i>. Suppose we wish to write a melody using only the 
notes of one octave of a major scale: eight notes to choose from (including 
tonic at both ends of the scale). Even if we restrict ourselves to melodies six 
notes in length (to choose an arbitrary but manageable limit), and even if we 
ignore rhythmic considerations entirely, the number of possibilities is 
8 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 8, which is 8<sup>6</sup> (8 to the 6th power) or 262,144&#8212;more than a 
quarter-million possible melodies, far more than anyone would care to list and 
count by hand. (The fact that many of these melodies will not be of much musical 
interest is, of course, beside the point of the present all-inclusive 
calculation. At least in principle, the formula is subject to numerous possible 
refinements on the basis of various criteria for &#8220;musical interest.&#8221;)</p>
<p>[14]
The above calculation enumerates the melodies that are <i>exactly</i> six notes long. 
If we wish to consider melodies that are<i> no more than</i> six notes long, then we 
may add the corresponding results for lengths 1 through 6, yielding</p>
<p style="text-align: center">8<sup>1</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>5</sup> + 8<sup>6</sup> = 8 + 64 + 512 + 4,096 + 32,768 + 262,144 = 299,592.</p>
<p>This sum may be written more compactly in the form</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="hook_eq1.gif" width="41" height="50"></p>
<p>(&#8220;the summation of 8<sup><i>k</i></sup> as <i>k</i> ranges from 1 to 6&#8221;).</p>
<p>[15]
This formula is a simple one, but a few further remarks are in order for the 
benefit of readers with little experience in such calculations. In light of our 
previous remarks about the multiplication principle, it is worth taking a moment 
to consider why the six powers of 8 have been <i>added</i> rather than multiplied. We 
did not set out to write a one-note melody <i>and</i> a two-note melody <i>and</i> a 
three-note melody, and so on through six successive independently constructed 
melodies; had that been our intent, we would have multiplied the numbers. (The 
resulting product, 8<sup>1</sup> &#0183; 8<sup>2</sup> &#0183; 8<sup>3</sup> &#0183; 8<sup>4</sup> &#0183; 8<sup>5</sup> &#0183; 8<sup>6</sup>, is precisely 8<sup>21</sup>, which is as we should 
have suspected, since by making all the above choices in succession we would 
effectively have composed a 21-note melody.) Rather, the problem called for us 
to choose a one-note melody <i>or</i> a two-note melody <i>or</i> a three-note melody 
<i>or</i> <nobr>. . .</nobr> 
The difference between <i>and</i> and <i>or</i> is the difference between multiplication and 
addition. In making a single selection from several mutually exclusive sets of 
choices, the possibilities must be added, not multiplied.</p>
<p>[16]
The number of melodies with <i>no more than</i> six notes (299,592) does not appear 
much larger than the number with <i>exactly</i> six notes (262,144). Another look at 
the summation above shows why. Each successive power of 8 is significantly 
larger than all the previous ones, so the sum is dominated by its last (and 
largest) term. All melodies of one through five notes are numerically 
insignificant compared with the melodies of six notes&#8212;but bumping the length 
limit up from six notes to seven would change the magnitude of the total 
dramatically.</p>
<p>[17]
A detail-minded mathematician could claim that the above sum overlooks one 
melody of &#8220;no more than six notes,&#8221; namely the &#8220;empty melody&#8221; consisting of no 
notes at all. If we wish to account for this &#8220;melody of length zero,&#8221; we may do 
so with little difficulty. The 0th power of any positive number is 1 by 
definition,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> so adding 8<sup>0</sup> at the beginning of the sum increases the total by 1; 
the revised total is</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="hook_eq2.gif" width="130" height="53"></p>
<p>[18]
Such formulas are reasonably compact and convenient, but the calculation of this 
sum of powers still entails several steps. Much of the work of the early 
combinatorists was devoted to the derivation of formulas by which such 
calculations could be simplified further. Precisely such a formula is applicable 
in this case, namely the &#8220;sum of a geometric series&#8221; given by</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq3.gif"></p>
<p>Substituting <i>a</i> = 8 and <i><i>n</i></i> = 6 in this equation, the right side reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq4.gif"></p>
<p>the same answer as before. Here the summation of six powers has been replaced by 
a single power calculation and a simple division&#8212;a gain in efficiency that 
becomes more pronounced as the numbers involved grow larger.</p>
<p>[19]
<i>1.3. Example: twelve-tone rows</i>. How many possible twelve-tone rows are there? At 
first glance this example resembles the previous one, but with twelve notes to 
choose from (rather than eight) and twelve notes in the melody (rather than 
six), so we might suppose that the answer should be 12<sup>12</sup>. But there is a 
problem: a melody twelve notes in length can (and usually will) repeat one or 
more pitch classes, so not all of the 12<sup>12</sup> melodies are actually valid rows.</p>
<p>[20]
The multiplication principle is still applicable to this problem, but it must be 
applied judiciously. Let us construct a twelve-tone row, one note at a time. Of 
course there are 12 choices for the first note. But whatever the first note is, 
it cannot be repeated, so there are only 11 possible choices for the second note 
(and therefore 12 &#0183; 11 = 132 possibilities for the first two notes in order, 
rather than 12 &#0183; 12 = 144). By the same reasoning, there are only 10 possibilities 
for the third note, 9 for the fourth, and so on, and the total number of 
possible rows is</p>
<p style="text-align: center">12 &#0183; 11 &#0183; 10 &#0183; 9 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 7 &#0183; 6 &#0183; 5 &#0183; 4 &#0183; 3 &#0183; 2 &#0183; 1 = 479,001,600.</p>
<p>This product is traditionally known as &#8220;12 factorial,&#8221; abbreviated 12!. (In 
general, <i><i>n</i></i>! is the product of all the integers from 1 to <i><i>n</i></i>.) This is a very 
large number&#8212;almost half a billion&#8212;but it is nevertheless far smaller than 12<sup>12</sup>, 
which is almost 9 trillion. (As <i><i>n</i></i> increases, <i><i>n</i></i>! grows very rapidly&#8212;but not as 
rapidly as <i><i>n</i><sup><i>n</i></sup></i>.)</p>
<p>[21]
The last factor in the above product is the number 1. Multiplying by 1, of 
course, has no bearing on the result. This makes sense because once the first 
eleven notes of a twelve-tone row have been selected, the twelfth is 
automatically determined&#8212;there are no more choices to make. In a twelve-pc 
universe, the number of twelve-tone rows is the same as the number of 
eleven-tone rows.</p>
<p>[22]
The above calculation gives the literal count of arrangements of the twelve 
pitch classes; it does not take into account the convention in serial theory by 
which rows related to each other by transposition, inversion, or retrogression 
are considered equivalent. We have counted rows, that is, not row classes. If 
all row classes consisted of exactly 48 rows, the number of row classes could be 
obtained by dividing the above total by 48. But there are some symmetrical rows 
(that of Berg&#8217;s <i>Lyric Suite</i> being a well-known example) whose classes contain 
only 24 rows rather than 48, so this calculation would be in error. The precise 
calculation of the number of row classes is a considerably more complex problem, 
and will be considered in Part II. (In fact, <i>most</i> row classes do comprise 48 
distinct rows, so even the incorrect calculation outlined above would give a 
good estimate, differing from the actual count of row classes by less than 0.1 
percent.)</p>
<p>[23] <i>1.4. Permutations</i>. The enumeration of twelve-tone rows is an example of a 
<i>permutation</i> problem. A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. It 
should be evident from the above discussion that the number of permutations of <i><i>n</i></i> 
objects is <i><i>n</i></i>!. Occasionally it is useful to form a permutation of some 
<i>subset</i> of 
the available objects rather than of all of them; that is, there are <i><i>n</i></i> objects 
from which to choose, but we are to construct an ordered arrangement of only <i>k</i> 
of them, for some <i>k</i> &lt; <i><i>n</i></i>. Such arrangements are referred to as &#8220;permutations of <i><i>n</i></i> 
objects <i>k</i> at a time,&#8221; and the number of these permutations is denoted 
<i>P</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>). 
By the above reasoning, <i>P</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>) may be calculated as a product <i>n</i> &#0183; (<i>n</i> &#8211; 1)  &#0183; (<i>n</i> &#8211; 
2)   &#0183;   &#0183;   &#0183; (<i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i> + 1), similar to the calculation of <i>n</i>! but stopping after the first <i>k</i> 
factors. This product may be written more compactly in the form</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq5.gif"></p>
<p>In this formula the <i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i> &#8220;extra&#8221; factors (<i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i>) 
<sup><font size="4">. . .</font></sup> 1 in <i>n</i>! in the numerator of 
the fraction are exactly canceled by the corresponding factors in (<i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i>)! in 
the denominator.</p>
<p>[24] <i>1.5. Example: melodies with no repeated notes</i>. Suppose again that we wish to 
write a six-note melody from our one-octave diatonic scale, but now with the 
restriction that all six notes must be different. The number of ways to do this 
is <i>P</i>(8, 6), or 8 &#0183; 7 &#0183; 6 &#0183; 5 &#0183; 4 &#0183; 3, or 8!/2!, or 20,160. This figure represents a 
drastic reduction from the number 262,144 calculated previously when note 
repetitions were allowed: more than 92 percent of the six-note melodies 
enumerated in section 1.2 include at least one note repetition. This statistical 
generalization is surely reflected in compositional practice: apart from the 
occasional unidirectional scalar melody (&#8220;Joy to the World&#8221;), coherent melodic 
phrases in which no notes are repeated are rare.</p>
<p>[25] <i>1.6. Example: pitch-class sets</i>. How many pitch-class sets are there? It may not 
be immediately obvious that the multiplication principle applies to this 
question: pc-sets are not permutations, and we do not ordinarily think of 
constructing a pc-set through an orderly selection process with an easily 
determined number of choices at each stage. But there is such a process, a very 
simple one in fact, and it illustrates the creative logic with which simple 
combinatorial principles can often be applied. A pc-set may be uniquely 
specified by considering each of the twelve pitch classes in turn, and answering 
for each one a yes-or-no question. Is C in the set? Is C-sharp in the set? Is D 
in the set? When all twelve questions have been answered, the set is determined. 
The number of pitch-class sets is the number of ways the questions can be 
answered, namely 2<sup>12</sup> = 4,096. This number appears at the right side of Table 1. 
The calculation accounts for both the empty set (the result of answering &#8220;no&#8221; to 
all questions) and the complete twelve-tone aggregate (&#8220;yes&#8221; to all questions), 
along with everything in between. By the same reasoning, the number of distinct 
subsets of any set with <i>n</i> elements is always precisely 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>.</p>
<p>[26] <i>1.7. Example: rhythms</i>. How many different rhythms are possible within a 4/4 
measure, given that there are no rests and that all durations are to be eighth 
notes or whole multiples thereof? This problem, too, is a simple one when viewed 
from the proper perspective. Such a rhythm may be represented as a string of 
eight eighth notes, with some adjacent notes joined by ties. Specifying a rhythm 
is tantamount to specifying a subset of the seven possible ties; the number of 
possibilities is therefore 2<sup>7</sup> = 128. If sixteenth-note multiple durations are 
allowed, the number rises dramatically to 2<sup>15</sup> = 32,768.</p>
<p>[27] <i>1.8. Example: pitch-class sets of specified cardinality; combinations</i>. How many 
four-note pitch-class sets are there? The figure 4,096 calculated in section 1.6 
gives the total number of pc-sets of all possible cardinalities in mod-12 space, 
but we have not yet shown how to calculate the number of pc-sets of any given 
size. There are <i>P</i>(12, 4) = 11,880 permutations of four pcs, but that is not the 
number of four-note pc-sets: the 11,880 permutations would, for instance, count 
C&#8211;D&#8211;E&#8211;G, C&#8211;D&#8211;G&#8211;E, and E&#8211;G&#8211;C&#8211;D as three separate permutations even though as 
pc-sets they are all the same. Permutations are <i>ordered</i> arrangements; unordered 
collections are known as <i>combinations</i>. In terminology more familiar in music 
theory, combinations are <i>sets</i> while permutations are <i>segments</i> or 
<i>strings</i>.</p>
<p>[28]
The number of &#8220;combinations of <i>n</i> things <i>k</i> at a time&#8221; is denoted <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>); this is 
simply the number of different <i>k</i>-element subsets of a fixed <i>n</i>-element set. 
Clearly <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>) is a smaller number than <i>P</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>). How much smaller? In the case 
of four-note sets, the enumeration of the <i>P</i>(12, 4) permutations will count every 
combination many times&#8212;precisely 4! = 24 times, in fact, because the four notes 
of any such set can be permuted in 4! ways. It follows that <i>C</i>(12, 4) is exactly 
<i>P</i>(12, 4) divided by 24, which is 11,880/24 or 495. The general combinations 
formula is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq6.gif"></p>
<p>[29]
These combination numbers <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>) (for <i>n</i> = 12) are precisely the numbers in the 
central row of Table 1. This row is symmetrical from left to right, because <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, 
<i>k</i>) = <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i>). This is clear from the above formula, in which <i>k</i> and <i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i> are 
interchangeable; of course it is also clear because <i>k</i>-element sets are in 
one-to-one correspondence with their (<i>n</i> &#8211; <i>k</i>)-element complements.</p>

<p>[30] <i>1.9. Pascal&#8217;s triangle and the binomial theorem</i>. The combination numbers turn up 
in many diverse mathematical contexts. These are, in fact, the numbers appearing 
in <i>Pascal&#8217;s triangle</i>, shown in <b>Figure 1</b>. The number <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>) may be found at the 
intersection of the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> row and the <i>k</i><sup>th</sup> diagonal, as illustrated in the figure 
for <i>n</i> = 8 and <i>k</i> = 3. Each number in the interior of this triangle is the sum of 
the two numbers immediately above it. The preceding discussion explains why the 
triangle is symmetrical from left to right, and why the sum of all the numbers 
in the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> row is exactly 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>.</p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em">[31]
The combination numbers appear also in the well-known <i>binomial theorem</i>. If the 
algebraic expression <i><i>x</i></i> + <i><i>y</i></i> (a <i>binomial</i>) is raised to successive powers, the 
numbers appearing as coefficients in the various terms of the algebraic 
expansions are exactly the combination numbers <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>), and can, in fact, be 
read directly across the rows of Pascal&#8217;s triangle, as illustrated in <b>Figure 2</b>. 
The numbers <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>) are therefore often called <i>binomial coefficients</i>. A 
frequently used alternate notation for binomial coefficients is </p>
		<p style="margin-top:0em; text-align:center"> <img border="0" src="hook_eq7.gif"></p>
<p>The symbol on the right is commonly pronounced &#8220;<i>n</i> choose <i>k</i>,&#8221; reflecting the 
number&#8217;s interpretation as an enumeration of combinations.</p>

<p>[32]
The relation between binomial expansions and enumeration is worth lingering over 
a bit longer, because it resembles, in a somewhat simplified form, the more 
advanced enumeration techniques to be explored in Part II. According to the 
binomial theorem, the expansion of the binomial (<i><i>x</i></i> + <i><i>y</i></i>)<sup>12</sup> is</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(<i>x</i> + <i>y</i>)<sup>12</sup> = <i>C</i>(12, 0)<i>x</i><sup>12</sup> + <i>C</i>(12, 1)<i>x</i><sup>11</sup><i>y</i> + 
<sup><font size="4">. . .</font></sup> + <i>C</i>(12, 11)<i>xy</i><sup>11</sup> + <i>C</i>(12, 12)<i>y</i><sup>12</sup>,</p>
<p>which may be calculated as</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>x</i><sup>12</sup> + 12<i>x</i><sup>11</sup><i>y</i> + 66<i>x</i><sup>10</sup><i>y</i><sup>2</sup> + 220<i>x</i><sup>9</sup><i>y</i><sup>3</sup> + 495<i>x</i><sup>8</sup><i>y</i><sup>4</sup> + 792<i>x</i><sup>7</sup><i>y</i><sup>5</sup> + 924<i>x</i><sup>6</sup><i>y</i><sup>6</sup><br>
+ 792<i>x</i><sup>5</sup><i>y</i><sup>7</sup> + 495<i>x</i><sup>4</sup><i>y</i><sup>8</sup> + 220<i>x</i><sup>3</sup><i>y</i><sup>9</sup> + 66<i>x</i><sup>2</sup><i>y</i><sup>10</sup> + 12<i>xy</i><sup>11</sup> + 
<i>y</i><sup>12</sup>.</p>
<p>The above expression is a polynomial in the two variables <i><i>x</i></i> and <i>y</i>; the 
polynomial is <i>homogeneous of degree</i> 12, meaning that in each term the exponents 
on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> add up to 12. The variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> here do not represent any 
particular quantities; they serve only as algebraic placeholders to assist us in 
organizing our calculations involving the coefficients, which are our primary 
interest.</p>
<p>[33]
These coefficients are, of course, the numbers from  Table 1, enumerating pc-sets 
of each cardinality from 0 to 12. The binomial theorem therefore provides a 
method for calculating the pc-set counts: take the abstract binomial <i>x</i> + <i>y</i>, 
raise it to the power 12, do the algebra, and the desired numbers emerge. We may 
say that (<i>x</i> + <i>y</i>)<sup>12</sup> is an <i>enumeration function</i> for the pc-set counts. In this 
case, doing the calculation in this rather cumbersome way is quite unnecessary 
because we already know a simple formula for the combination numbers. But there 
is no simple formula for the set-class numbers in the bottom row of Table 1. 
When we calculate these numbers in Part II, we shall do so by exhibiting an 
enumeration function for them&#8212;a function more complex than a power of a 
binomial, but similar to the binomial theorem in its general strategy.</p>
<p>[34] <i>1.10. Example: intervals in pitch-class sets</i>. Consider for a moment the numbers 
appearing in the <i>k</i> = 2 diagonal of Pascal&#8217;s triangle: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, <nobr>. . .</nobr> These are the numbers <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, 2) for <i>n</i> &#8805; 2. The combinations formula in this case 
reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq8.gif"></p>
<p>The number <i>C</i>(<i>n</i>, 2) has a natural musical interpretation as the number of 2-note 
subsets&#8212;that is, intervals&#8212;within a pc-set of cardinality <i>n</i>. This observation 
explains why the sum of the entries in the interval-class vector of a pc-set is 
always 3 for a trichord, 6 for a tetrachord, 10 for a pentachord, and so on.</p>
<p>[35] <i>1.11. Ars combinatoria and eighteenth-century music</i>. We conclude Part I with a 
few illustrations of ways in which elementary combinatorial principles such as 
those discussed above left their mark upon musical composition and scholarship 
in the eighteenth century. By this time, mathematical techniques and mechanistic 
explanations were infusing many aspects of life and art, and music was no 
exception. Many of the leading musical treatises of the day include careful 
enumerations of musical configurations of various kinds, as well as particularly 
methodical and exhaustive case-by-case analysis more or less in the spirit of 
<i>ars combinatoria</i>.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>[36]
Among the most fervent advocates of combinatorial methods in music was Joseph 
Riepel, who applied such methods to a great many musical parameters with 
meticulous thoroughness. In his <i>Grundregeln zur Tonordnung insgemein</i> of 1755, 
Riepel takes a four-note figure and exhibits all 4! = 24 possible permutations. 
Turning his attention to chord structure, he considers all possible three- and 
four-note diatonic chords over a fixed bass note; this is a problem in 
combinations rather than permutations, and Riepel recognizes correctly that the 
possibilities for three-note chords number <i>C</i>(7, 2) = 21 and for four-note chords 
<i>C</i>(7, 3) = 35. Another opportunity for permutations arises when Riepel considers 
the order of keys within a composition: for a piece that starts and ends in C 
major, Riepel actually lists all the 5! = 120 possible permutations of the other 
five closely related keys that could occur in between. In a later publication 
Riepel even enumerates patterns of articulation and bowing. As Riepel sums up 
his attitude in the <i>Grundregeln</i>, &#8220;the unique art of permutations, by 
which one can uncover in a single day far more than 99 themes, is at least 99 
times healthier for composition than the calculation of ratios.&#8221;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p>[37] Riepel was a practical musician, and as his disparaging reference to the 
pitch-ratio calculations used by Rameau and others as justification for their 
harmonic theories attests, he abhorred some kinds of abstract mathematical 
calculation. He evidently believed, though, that the study of permutations was a 
useful aid in the production of effective compositions. After enumerating 
melodic permutations and chords as described above, he proceeds to display every 
one of them in a sensible musical context (except for a few of the four-note 
chords that he dismisses as unworkable). Another theorist who expressed a 
similar view and who may even have surpassed Riepel in his zeal for 
combinatorics was Francesco Galeazzi, who in his <i>Elementi teorico-pratici di 
musica</i> of 1791&#8211;96 defends his method of inventing melodic figures by 
combinatorial manipulation, saying that it is especially suitable for sparking 
the imaginations of those who are otherwise unable to invent their own:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We find many who can proceed with a given figure with little effort but who have 
insuperable difficulties when they have to invent new material. Here is 
something that can assist (in invention) with which one can discover a hundred, 
a thousand in the twinkling of an eye: it may appear puerile but first 
experiment with it and then judge.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[38] <i>1.12. Dice games</i>. Among the best-known examples of combinatorial activity in 
eighteenth-century music are the &#8220;dice games&#8221; that were in vogue roughly for the 
latter half of the century. These games offer a completely mechanical way to 
compose: as their authors almost invariably point out, one need not know any 
rules of music, only the rules of the game. The first such game appeared in 1757 
as Johann Philipp Kirnberger&#8217;s first published work, <i>Der allezeit fertige 
Polonaisen- und Menuettencomponist</i> (&#8220;Every-Ready Polonaise and Minuet 
Composer&#8221;). Kirnberger&#8217;s method spawned a wealth of imitators, with more than a 
dozen similar games appearing in the following decades, including games 
attributed somewhat dubiously to Haydn and Mozart.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>

<p>[39] To play the game, one generally rolls a die (or rolls two dice, or spins a top, 
or generates a random number by some other means), then looks up the resulting 
number in a table to find a reference to a measure (more or less) of music, 
which one transcribes; then one rolls again, consults the next column of the 
table to find the next measure; and so on. After typically sixteen or thirty-two 
measures, one has a complete waltz, or minuet, or polonaise, or march, or organ 
prelude. The logic of the game is simple enough: all the possible outcomes for 
any given measure share a harmonic basis, so the broad tonal outline of the 
piece is fixed, independent of the rolls of the dice, though the melodic and 
rhythmic details are quite variable. The scrambled appearance of the numbers in 
the table is contrived to shield the player from the underlying logic, thereby 
making the reasonably coherent music that emerges seem downright magical.</p>

<p>[40] Because of the multiplication principle, the number of possible compositions 
that can result from even a short dice game is enormous. In the game attributed 
to Mozart, for example, two dice are rolled, so there are eleven possible 
outcomes for each measure (the numbers 2 through 12&#8212;not all of which, it may be 
noted, are equally likely). The number of possibilities for the sixteen measures 
of music should therefore be 11<sup>16</sup>, a 17-digit number. Careful scrutiny of the 
tables reveals, however, that all eleven versions of measure 8 are the same, as 
are all eleven versions of measure 16, so the actual number of possible 
compositions is 11<sup>14</sup>, which is &#8220;only&#8221; about 380,000,000,000,000. Of course the 
actual variety present in these compositions is far more limited than such a 
vast sum may suggest, because they share an underlying harmonic structure and 
are composed from a common pool of musical fragments. Nevertheless, Joel Lester 
and Leonard Ratner have pointed out that these games could have come to the aid 
of a host in need of a supply of dances with which to entertain his guests, or a 
small-town organist without ready access to large quantities of printed music 
(<a href="#lester_1992" id="citation_lester_1992_67dc9b0edd857">Lester 1992</a>, 229; <a href="#ratner_1970" id="citation_ratner_1970_67dc9b0edd859">Ratner 1970</a>, 357).</p>

<p>[41] Eighteenth-century dice games have been cited by David Cope as important 
precedents for his much-publicized &#8220;Experiments in Musical Intelligence&#8221; 
computer program, which composes music in various styles (<a href="#cope_2001" id="citation_cope_2001_67dc9b0edd85b">Cope 2001</a>), but such 
games may seem far removed from the usual compositional practices and artistic 
ideals of human composers such as Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Ratner, however, 
discerns quasi-combinatorial processes at work in the music of all three of the 
Viennese masters (<a href="#ratner_1970" id="citation_ratner_1970_67dc9b0edd85c">Ratner 1970</a>, 359&#8211;62). Ratner observes, for instance, that the 
patchwork rearrangement of an eight-measure melody near the end of the <i>Alla tedesca</i> movement of Beethoven&#8217;s String Quartet, Op. 130, is a permutational 
process. A Mozartian brand of permutation is on display in the famous five-part 
counterpoint that brings the curtain down on the &#8220;Jupiter&#8221; Symphony: the five 
melodic figures are traded among the five string parts in a largely systematic 
sequence of permutations constructed to ensure that each part takes a turn at 
each figure.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> (It has been suggested that writing out the 5! = 120 permutations 
of this counterpoint by hand would constitute apt punishment for unruly theory 
students.) Haydn&#8217;s frequent rearrangements of themes in his recapitulations also 
represent a sort of permutation; in that light, even sonata form can be seen as 
a series of slots into which musical elements may be inserted through 
combinatorial play. In Ratner&#8217;s concluding words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Ars combinatoria</i> is not composition but a resource in its service; it is a 
rational, intellectual device that can help to spark musical feeling, to set the 
clockwork in motion, to stir the mechanical into life. (<a href="#ratner_1970" id="citation_ratner_1970_67dc9b0edd860">Ratner 1970</a>, 361&#8211;62)</p>

<h3 align="center">II. Advanced Techniques</h3>

<p>[42] <i>2.1. Groups of equivalences</i>. Enumerating set classes&#8212;the bottom row of numbers 
in Table 1&#8212;is not a simple exercise in permutations or combinations. Instead, the problem is to count equivalence classes under a given equivalence relation. The equivalence relation is defined by a group <i>G</i> of <i>transformations</i><sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> acting on a set <i>Z</i> of <i>configurations</i> of some sort; two configurations are considered 
equivalent if some transformation in the group maps one to the other. For this 
reason we call <i>G</i> the <i>group of equivalences</i> for the enumeration problem under 
consideration. (In the usual conception of pc-sets and set classes, the 
configurations are pc-sets and the group of equivalences consists of all the 
transposition and inversion operators.) The problem is to enumerate not the 
configurations themselves but the equivalence classes, or <i>orbits</i> as they are 
commonly called. The orbit of a configuration <i>z</i> in the set <i>Z</i> consists of all the 
configurations <i>g</i>(<i>z</i>), as <i>g</i> ranges through the transformations in the group <i>G</i>. In 
many cases we are interested not only in a single count of all the orbits, but 
in sub-counts of orbits of certain types (such as set classes consisting of sets 
of certain specific cardinalities).</p>

<p>[43] Although this problem is not one of permutations as discussed in Part I, the 
word <i>permutation</i> is often employed in this context as well&#8212;a usage whose sense 
it is important to understand. The configurations under consideration typically 
consist of a fixed number <i>N</i> of objects arranged in some characteristic way, and 
a transformation typically acts on a configuration by rearranging, or <i>permuting</i>, 
the <i>N</i> objects. In Part I we described permutations as static <i>arrangements</i> of 
objects, but they may also be regarded more dynamically as <i>mappings</i>, or 
<i>transformations</i>, that map a set of objects to itself. A pitch-class operator 
such as <i>T</i><sub>4</sub><i>I</i> may be regarded as a permutation of the twelve pitch classes, either 
as a mapping</p>

<p>or in static form as the arrangement 43210BA98765. The <i>N</i>! possible permutations 
of <i>N</i> objects form a group (commonly known as <i>S<sub>N</sub></i>, the <i>symmetric group</i> on <i>N</i> 
objects), and the group of equivalences <i>G</i> in any enumeration problem is 
typically a subgroup of <i>S<sub>N</sub></i>. Of course, <i>G</i> need not include every permutation in 
<i>S<sub>N</sub></i>. Indeed, if it does, then every configuration is deemed &#8220;equivalent&#8221; to every 
other, so they are all in the same orbit and there is nothing of interest to 
count. The twelve pitch classes theoretically admit 12! = 479,001,600 
permutations, but most of these permutations jumble the pitch classes in 
musically nonsensical fashion; only 24 of them are members of the group of 
transposition and inversion operators.</p>

<p>[44] <i>2.2. Burnside&#8217;s Lemma</i>. A single overall count of orbits can generally be 
calculated by means of a theorem that goes by the name of <i>Burnside&#8217;s</i> <i>Lemma</i>:<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>If a group <i>G</i> acts on a set <i>Z</i> of configurations, the number of orbits is
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq9.gif"></p>
	<p>where |<i>G</i>| denotes the order (cardinality) of the group 
	<i>G</i>; the sum is taken over 
all permutations <i>g</i> in the group <i>G</i>; and <i>&psi;</i>(<i>g</i>) denotes the number of configurations 
fixed by the permutation <i>g</i> (that is, the number of configurations <i>z</i> in 
	<i>Z</i> such 
that <i>g</i>(<i>z</i>) = <i>z</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By adding up <i><i>&psi;</i></i>(<i>g</i>) for the various permutations <i>g</i> in the group <i>G</i> and then dividing by the order of the group, as the above formula specifies, we are 
effectively calculating the <i>average</i> value of <i>&psi;</i>(<i>g</i>). Burnside&#8217;s Lemma says, 
therefore, that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of 
configurations fixed by an element of the transformation group. Upon reflection, 
this formula should make intuitive sense. In the trivial case in which the only 
element of the group is the identity <i>e</i>, each configuration is an orbit by 
itself, so the number of orbits is the number of configurations, which is also 
<i>&psi;</i>(<i>e</i>) since the identity fixes everything. If there are other transformations in 
the group that fix fewer things, then more things become equivalent, the number 
of orbits decreases, and the average value of <i>&psi;</i>(<i>g</i>) decreases also.</p>

<p>[45] Before applying Burnside&#8217;s Lemma to the set-class problem, it is instructive to 
consider two simpler situations of types commonly encountered in the study of 
combinatorics, which we shall call the <i>birthday-cake problem</i> and the <i>necklace 
problem</i>.</p>

<div style="width:800px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 3</b>. Four configurations of candles on a birthday cake or beads in a necklace</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="hook_examples.php?id=3&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 3 thumbnail" src="hook_fig3_small.gif"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>[46] <i>2.3. Example: birthday-cake problem</i>. First suppose you wish to put four candles 
on a cake; you have four fixed positions in which to place candles, and you have 
supplies of candles of three different colors (red, blue, green). The number of 
configurations is 3<sup>4</sup> = 81. But some of these are equivalent, because a birthday 
cake can be rotated. In <b>Figure 3</b>, for example, configurations (a) and (b) are 
equivalent; if you decorate the cake as at (a), you can easily turn it to look 
like (b). Neither configuration (c) nor (d), however, is equivalent to any of 
the others shown (even though all four use the same colors in the same 
quantities). The group of equivalences <i>G</i> is the <i>cyclic</i> <i>group</i> <i>C</i><sub>4</sub> of order 4. The elements of this group are analogous to transpositions in pitch-class space, so 
we may designate them by the labels <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>T</i><sub>3</sub>. <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> is the identity 
transformation&#8212;the identity element of the group&#8212;and of course it fixes all 81 
configurations, so <i>&psi;</i>(<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>) = 81. <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is a 90-degree clockwise rotation; the only 
way a configuration can be unchanged by this rotation is if all four candles are 
the same color. The only possibilities for such a configuration are the three 
single-color candle arrangements (all red candles, all blue, or all green), so 
<i>&psi;</i>(<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>) = 3. Likewise <i>T</i><sub>3</sub>, the 90-degree rotation in the opposite direction, fixes 
only these same three configurations, so <i>&psi;</i>(<i>T</i><sub>3</sub>) = 3 also. For a configuration to 
be fixed by the 180-degree rotation <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, the candles opposite each other must be 
the same color, but the two pairs of opposite candles need not match; there are 
3<sup>2</sup> = 9 such configurations, so <i>&psi;</i>(<i>T</i><sub>3</sub>) = 9. Burnside&#8217;s Lemma tells us, therefore, 
that the number of orbits&#8212;the number of distinguishable ways to decorate the 
birthday cake&#8212;is the average of these four values of <i>&psi;</i>(<i>g</i>): </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq10.gif"></p>
<p>The reader may enjoy the not-too-difficult exercise of listing these 24 
inequivalent configurations.<p>

<p>[47] <i>2.4. Example: necklace problem</i>. The diagrams in Figure 3 could represent beads 
in a necklace as well as candles on a birthday cake. The group of equivalences 
is different in the necklace problem, however, because a necklace may be flipped 
over as well as rotated; configurations (c) and (d) in Figure 3 are equivalent 
in the necklace problem but not in the birthday-cake problem. The group is now 
the <i>dihedral group</i> <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>, which consists of <i>eight</i> transformations of the four-sided 
figure. Four of these are the rotations <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>3</sub> as before. The other four 
are <i>reflections</i>, which we may designate <i>I</i> (= <i>T</i><sub>0</sub><i>I</i>), <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>3</sub><i>I</i>. The notation 
here pursues the analogy with familiar transformations of musical pitch-class 
space; <i>I</i> is understood to be a flip about the vertical axis in the diagram, and 
<i>T<sub>j</sub>I</i> is the result of following the reflection <i>I</i> by the rotation <i>T<sub>j</sub></i>. </p>

<p>[48] To apply Burnside&#8217;s Lemma to the necklace problem, we must calculate the number  of configurations fixed by each transformation in the group <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>. For this purpose the graphic depictions of the actions of the transformations in <b>Figure 4</b> may 
prove helpful, along with the tabulation in <b>Table 2</b>. Here the transformations 
are represented as permutations of the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. Figure 4 shows, 
for example, that <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> effects a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the initial 
configuration, mapping 0 to position 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 0; this action 
is represented in Table 2 by the chain of arrows 
0&#8594;1&#8594;2&#8594;3&#8594;0. The reflection <i>I</i> 
leaves 0 and 2 unchanged (0&#8594;0, 2&#8594;2) while interchanging 1 and 3 (1&#8594;3&#8594;1). The 
reflection <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i> behaves somewhat differently, exchanging the numbers in two pairs 
(0&#8594;1&#8594;0, 2&#8594;3&#8594;2).</p>

<p>[49] The calculations of <i>&psi;</i>(<i>g</i>) for the various transformations <i>g</i> depend heavily on how the permutations break down into <i>cycles</i>. The three transformations just 
considered, in fact, have three different cycle structures. The rotation <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> 
permutes the four numbers in a single cycle, described by the action 0&#8594;1&#8594;2&#8594;3&#8594;0 
or the more compact <i>cycle representation</i> (0 1 2 3). (The closing parenthesis 
indicates the completion of the cycle&#8212;that is, the implied mapping of the last 
number listed to the first, in this case 3&#8594;0.) This is a cycle of four elements, 
or a <i>4-cycle</i>. The reflection <i>I</i>, in contrast, breaks down into two 1-cycles and a 
2-cycle, (0)(1 3)(2), while <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i> breaks down into two 2-cycles, (0 1)(2 3). (The 
order in which the cycles are listed in a permutation is of no consequence, and 
cyclic reorderings of the numbers within any one cycle are also possible; thus 
<i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i> could equally well be represented in the form (3 2)(0 1), for example. We 
follow the convention of listing smaller numbers first whenever there is a 
choice.)</p>

<p>[50] A transformation always maps any element to the next element within its cycle. 
In order for a necklace configuration to be fixed by a transformation, 
therefore, all the elements within any one cycle must be the same color, but the 
colors for elements in different cycles may be chosen independently. So the 
number of configurations fixed by any transformation (still under the assumption 
that there are three available colors) is 3<sup><i>k</i></sup>, where <i>k</i> is the number of distinct 
cycles in the cycle representation. These numbers are tabulated in Table 2. The 
numbers in the &#8220;Fixed configurations&#8221; column can then be plugged into the 
formula of Burnside&#8217;s Lemma to calculate that the number of orbits in the 
necklace problem&#8212;the number of distinguishable four-bead necklaces that can be 
constructed using beads of three colors&#8212;is </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq11.gif"></p>
<p>This number is, as we should expect, smaller than the corresponding result in 
the birthday-cake problem, which was 24: more transformations are allowable for 
necklaces, so more configurations are equivalent and the number of orbits is 
reduced. Recall that configurations (c) and (d) in  Figure 3 belong to two 
different orbits in the birthday-cake problem but are subsumed in a single orbit 
when reflections are allowed in the necklace problem. The reduction from 24 
orbits to 21 is a small one; in fact, the orbits of configurations (c) and (d), 
and two other similar orbit pairs involving two blue or two green beads, are the 
only orbits to be conflated in this way.</p>

<p>[51] <i>2.5. Cycle structure of permutations</i>. The final two columns in Table 2 supply 
some additional information that will prove useful later in the general 
application of P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem. The <i>cycle type</i> is a shorthand accounting of the 
number of cycles of each length: 4<sup>1</sup> in the case of <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> indicates a single 
4-cycle, while 1<sup>2</sup>2<sup>1</sup> in the case of <i>I</i> indicates two 1-cycles and one 2-cycle. The 
cycle type is converted in a straightforward way to the <i>cycle index</i>, an 
algebraic expression in which abstract variables <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>4</sub> stand in for the 
corresponding cycle lengths. More precisely, the <i>cycle index</i> <i>p<sub>g</sub></i> of a permutation 
<i>g</i> of <i>N</i> objects is an expression potentially involving the <i>N</i> variables <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, 
<i>t<sub>N</sub></i>, namely</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq12.gif"></p>
<p>where <i>&lambda;<sub>j</sub></i>(<i>g</i>) is the number of <i>j</i>-cycles in the cycle representation of <i>g</i>. The 
cycle index <i>P<sub>G</sub></i> <i>of a permutation group</i> <i>G</i> is a more complex polynomial in <i>N</i> 
variables, defined as the average of the cycle indices of all the permutations 
in <i>G</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq13.gif"></p>
<p>The variables <i>t<sub>j</sub></i> do not stand for anything in particular at this point, but 
later will be replaced by something more concrete.</p>

<p>[52] <i>2.6. Example</i>: <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> <i>set classes</i>. The set-class problem in music theory is 
essentially the necklace problem with two modifications: more objects and fewer 
colors. The objects are the twelve pitch classes. A pc-set may be specified by 
coloring the pitch classes with two colors, called <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>. That is, a pc 
either belongs to a given pc-set or it does not; the 2<sup>12</sup> colorings of the pitch 
classes uniquely determine each of the 2<sup>12</sup> pc-sets. The group of equivalences is 
the dihedral group <i>D</i><sub>12</sub> of order 24, consisting of twelve rotations 
(transpositions) and twelve reflections (inversions) of mod-12 pitch-class 
space. <b>Table 3</b> displays the cycle structures of all 24 of these transformations. 
The cycle representations here reflect properties of the transformations that 
music theorists will recognize. The twelve transpositions display six different 
cycle types, while the twelve inversions are of only two types: even-numbered 
inversions that fix two pitch classes, and odd-numbered inversions that fix 
none. Adding up the numbers of configurations fixed by these transformations and 
dividing by 24, as specified by Burnside&#8217;s Lemma, yields 224, the total number 
of set classes appearing in the lower-right corner of  Table 1.</p>

<p>[53] <i>2.7. Weighted colors</i>. The complete solution of the set-class problem entails 
more than this single number: we must still show how to derive the numbers of 
set classes of the various cardinalities from 0 through 12. To this end, let us 
step back momentarily to a higher level of abstraction, a general setting 
involving configurations of <i>N</i> objects colored with <i>k</i> colors. We assign an 
algebraic symbol to each color; these symbols will be called the <i>weights</i> of the 
colors. In the birthday-cake or necklace problem, for example, we could assign 
the weights <i>r</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>g</i> to the colors red, blue, and green. In the set-class 
problem we could assign weight <i>x</i> to the color <i>no</i> and weight <i>y</i> to the color 
<i>yes</i>. 
In the general setting in which there are <i>k</i> colors from which to choose, we 
shall write <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>w<sub>k</sub></i> for the weights assigned to the colors.</p>

<p>[54] Define the <i>weight of a configuration</i> to be the product of the weights of the 
colors of its objects. The weight of a configuration thus describes the 
multiplicities of its colors. All four configurations shown in Figure 3, for 
example, are of weight <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>bg</i>. In the set-class problem the weight of any 
tetrachord is <i>x</i><sup>8</sup><i>y</i><sup>4</sup> (eight pitch classes colored 
<i>no</i>, four <i>yes</i>). The weight of a 
configuration is a property of the configuration itself, and does not depend on 
the group of equivalences. When a group is at hand, however, permuting the 
objects does not change the weight of a configuration, so equivalent 
configurations (in the same orbit) will always have the same weight. The 
converse is not true: configurations of the same weight need not be in the same 
orbit, as Figure 3 illustrates. Because configurations in the same orbit have 
the same weight, it makes sense to speak of the <i>weight of an orbit</i>&#8212;that is, the 
common weight of all the configurations in the orbit. The problem is now to 
calculate the number of different orbits of any given weight.</p>

<p>[55] To do this, as was suggested in Part I, we shall exhibit an enumeration 
function. An enumeration function for the birthday-cake or necklace problem will 
be a polynomial in the variables <i>r</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>g</i>, homogeneous of degree 4 (the 
number of colored objects in any configuration), in which the coefficient of 
<i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>bg</i> or any other such term is the number of distinct orbits of that weight. An 
enumeration function for the set-class problem will be a polynomial in the 
variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, homogeneous of degree 12 (the total number of &#8220;colored&#8221; pitch 
classes), in which the coefficient of <i>x</i><sup>8</sup><i>y</i><sup>4</sup> is the number of orbits of 
tetrachords (and similarly for the other terms). The reader may recall from Part 
I that the binomial theorem provided a formula of exactly this sort, but the 
numbers appearing there enumerated actual sets rather than set classes. (In 
fact, that formula may be considered a special case of the general 
orbit-counting formula we are now seeking&#8212;namely, the special case in which the 
group <i>G</i> consists of the identity permutation only, so that every pc-set defines 
its own orbit.)</p>

<p>[56] <i>2.8. P&oacute;lya&#8217;s Enumeration Theorem</i>. The enumeration function we are seeking is 
given explicitly by <i>P&oacute;lya&#8217;s Enumeration Theorem</i>:<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Suppose a transformation group <i>G</i> acts on configurations of <i>N</i> objects colored 
with <i>k</i> colors. Let the weights assigned to the colors be <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, 
	<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>w<sub>k</sub></i>, and 
define</p>
	<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq14.gif"></p>
	<p>Let <i>P<sub>G</sub></i> be the cycle index of the group <i>G</i>. Then the sum of the weights of all the 
orbits, counting each orbit once, is <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>(<i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[57] The cycle index of the group <i>G</i>, it will be recalled, is a polynomial in <i>N</i> 
variables, <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>(<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>t<sub>N</sub></i>), calculated by averaging together the cycle indices 
of the various permutations in the group. P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem instructs us to 
substitute <i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub><i>N</i></sub> for the variables <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>t<sub>N</sub></i> in this expression. 
Because <i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub><i>N</i>
</sub> are defined as sums of powers of the weights <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, 
<i>w<sub>k</sub></i>, the resulting expression <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>(<i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>) is ultimately a polynomial in <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, 
<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>w<sub>k</sub></i>; it is known as the <i>P&oacute;lya polynomial</i>. The theorem says that the P&oacute;lya 
polynomial is the enumeration function: by calculating this polynomial in full, 
we will see the number of orbits of each weight as the coefficient of the 
appropriate term.</p>

<p>[58] <i>2.9. Example: birthday-cake problem, revisited</i>. Let us consider in detail how P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem applies to the birthday-cake problem described previously, with 
<i>N</i> = 4 and <i>k</i> = 3. The group <i>G</i> is a cyclic group <i>C</i><sub>4</sub>, consisting only of the 
rotations <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>T</i><sub>3</sub>, whose cycle indices were presented in the top half of Table 2. These formulas involve the variables <i>t</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>t</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>t</i><sub>4</sub> (<i>t</i><sub>3</sub> happens not to 
appear), for which we must now substitute <i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub>, and <i>&alpha;</i><sub>4</sub>, defined as <i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>r</i> + <i>b</i> 
+ <i>g</i>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>r</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>g</i><sup>2</sup>, and <i>&alpha;</i><sub>4</sub> = 
<i>r</i><sup>4</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>4</sup> + <i>g</i><sup>4</sup>. We consider each of the rotations 
<i>T<sub>j</sub></i> in turn.</p>

<p>[59] The cycle index of <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>, as given in Table 2, is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq15.gif"></p>
<p>The contribution of <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> to the P&oacute;lya polynomial is therefore</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq16.gif"></p>
<p>This expression appears rather unwieldy; there are, however, well-known formulas 
(analogous to the binomial theorem) for raising an expression such as <i>r</i> + <i>b</i> + <i>g</i> 
to any given power. Computationally, the most cumbersome part of the calculation 
of a P&oacute;lya polynomial is usually the step involving the identity element of the 
group (<i>T</i><sub>0</sub> in this case). This odd state of affairs arises because the point of 
the calculation is to enumerate the configurations fixed by each transformation, 
and the identity fixes everything&#8212;more than any other transformation. The above 
polynomial in fact enumerates the weights of all 81 configurations in the 
birthday-cake problem, all of which, of course, are fixed by <i>T</i><sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>[60] The calculations involving <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>3</sub> are much simpler. Both have cycle index 
<i>t</i><sub>4</sub><sup>1</sup>, so the P&oacute;lya polynomial has two terms of the form</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq17.gif"></p>
<p>The only configurations fixed by <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>3</sub> are the three single-color 
configurations, and the above expression is simply the sum of their weights.</p>

<p>[61] Finally, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> is a permutation of cycle index <i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, so it contributes the term</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq18.gif"></p>
<p>This polynomial represents the sum of the weights of the nine configurations 
fixed by <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>[62] The complete P&oacute;lya polynomial for the birthday-cake problem is therefore</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq19.gif"></p>
<p>which reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq20.gif"></p>
<p>The coefficients in this formula (including several suppressed 1&#8217;s) give the 
number of orbits of each weight. For instance, the term 3<i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>bg</i> tells us that 
there are exactly three inequivalent configurations of weight <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>bg</i>. These are 
represented by configurations (a), (c), and (d) of  Figure 3. (Configuration (b), 
it will be recalled, is equivalent to (a) and is therefore not counted 
separately.) Readers should be able to convince themselves that there are no 
others: any arrangement of two red candles, one blue, and one green can be 
rotated to look like (a), (c), or (d). </p>

<p>[63] Two further remarks about the above formula are in order. First, the P&oacute;lya 
polynomial is homogeneous of degree 4: every term involves a product of exactly 
four factors <i>r</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>g</i> in some combination. In general, a P&oacute;lya polynomial is 
homogeneous of degree <i>N</i>, the number of objects in each configuration. (Indeed, 
the polynomial <i>must</i> be homogeneous of degree <i>N</i> if it is to enumerate the weights 
properly.) Second, the coefficients in the above formula sum to 24, which we 
calculated in section 2.3 to be the total number of orbits in the birthday-cake 
problem. The previous calculation was based on Burnside&#8217;s Lemma and did not 
involve weights; the weighted method given by P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem is simply a 
refinement of the same idea, showing exactly how the 24 orbits are distributed 
among the various weights.</p>

<p>[64] <i>2.10. Example: necklace problem, revisited</i>. The application of P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem 
to the necklace problem begins like that for the birthday-cake problem, but 
requires additional terms for the transformations <i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>2</sub><i>I</i>, and <i>T</i><sub>3</sub><i>I</i> in the 
dihedral group <i>D</i><sub>4</sub>. As Table 2 shows, two of these are permutations of cycle 
index <i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, so there are two more terms of the form <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, identical to the term 
for <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> displayed above. The other two are of cycle index <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup><i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>, and give rise 
to two terms of the form </p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq21.gif"></p>
<p>When these four new terms are added to the four calculated previously and the 
result is divided by 8 (not 4) and simplified, the resulting formula is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq22.gif"></p>
<p>which is identical to the formula for the birthday-cake problem except that the 
terms involving <i>r</i><sup>2</sup><i>bg</i>, <i>rb</i><sup>2</sup><i>g</i>, and 
<i>rbg</i><sup>2</sup><i> </i>now carry the coefficient 2 instead of 3, 
indicating (as observed previously in conjunction with Figure 3) that there are 
only two distinct necklace configurations of each of these weights rather than 
three.</p>

<p>[65] <i>2.11. Example: T<sub>n</sub>/T<sub>n</sub>I set classes, revisited</i>. We are finally in a position to realize our original objective: that is, to verify the set-class counts from Table 1. Here <i>N</i> = 12 and <i>k</i> = 2. The P&oacute;lya polynomial for enumerating the set 
classes involves the quantities <i>&alpha;</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>x</i> + <i>y</i>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>2</sub> = 
<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>2</sup>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>&alpha;</i><sub>12</sub> = 
<i>x</i><sup>12</sup> + <i>y</i><sup>12</sup>. 
There are 24 terms to be added, corresponding to the cycle structures of the 
transformations <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> and <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i>, as enumerated in Table 3 above. The calculation is 
rather lengthy, but is simplified somewhat by the numerous repetitions among 
these cycle types. The P&oacute;lya polynomial is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq23.gif"></p>
<p>which reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq24.gif"></p>
<p>The coefficients exactly match the numbers of set classes in Table 1.</p>

<p>[66] <i>2.12. Example: T<sub>n</sub> set classes</i>. Having developed the general technique of 
set-class enumeration, we may now readily apply it in a variety of alternative 
situations. We may, for instance, choose to consider only transpositional 
equivalence, so that inversionally related sets such as major and minor triads 
are no longer considered to belong to the same set class. This is the system 
called SG1 in <a href="#morris_2001" id="citation_morris_2001_67dc9b0edd8a6">Morris 2001</a>; it is analogous, in the world of twelve pcs and two 
colors, to stepping back from the necklace problem to the birthday-cake problem. 
The group of equivalences in this situation is the cyclic group <i>C</i><sub>12</sub> rather than 
the dihedral group <i>D</i><sub>12</sub>; we need only consider the terms associated with the 
transpositions <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> (the top half of  Table 3) in the above calculation. The 
resulting P&oacute;lya polynomial is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq25.gif"></p>
<p>which reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq26.gif"></p>
<p>As usual, the number of inequivalent pc-sets of each cardinality may be read 
directly from the coefficients in this formula. Comparison with the previous 
formula developed under the assumption of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> equivalence shows that the 
number of set classes increases when inversional equivalence is disregarded. 
This is as we should expect, of course; each asymmetrical set class of the 
<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> variety splits into two set classes of the <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> variety. There are now 43 
tetrachords rather than 29, because 14 asymmetrical tetrachord types have split. 
The total number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> set classes of all cardinalities, obtained by summing all 
the coefficients, is 352, compared with 224 in the <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> situation.</p>

<p>[67] <i>2.13. Example: T<sub>n</sub>/I/M set classes</i>. If we create <i>more</i> ways for pc-sets to be 
equivalent, then the number of set classes will <i>decrease</i>. One way to do this is 
to adjoin the operator <i>M</i> (multiplication by 5 mod 12) to the group of 
equivalences, as in Morris (<a href="#morris_1987" id="citation_morris_1987_67dc9b0edd8a8">1987</a>, <a href="#morris_1991" id="citation_morris_1991_67dc9b0edd8aa">1991</a>, <a href="#morris_2001" id="citation_morris_2001_67dc9b0edd8ab">2001</a>; the <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>I</i>/<i>M</i> system is called SG3 in <a href="#morris_2001" id="citation_morris_2001_67dc9b0edd8ac">Morris 2001</a>). The group is now of order 48, and includes transformations of the 
forms <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i><i>M</i> and <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>MI</i> in addition to the previous <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> and <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i>. The reader may verify 
that the transformation <i>M</i> is of cycle type 1<sup>4</sup>2<sup>4</sup> and therefore of cycle index 
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>4</sup>t<sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup>; the various transformations <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i><i>M</i> and <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>MI</i> 
are of several different types, including <i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>6</sup>, <i>t</i><sub>4</sub><sup>3</sup>,
<i>t</i><sub>6</sub><sup>2</sup>, <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>4</sup><i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>4</sup>,
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>6</sup><i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>, and <i>t</i><sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup><i>t</i><sub>6</sub><sup>1</sup>. The P&oacute;lya polynomial 
reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq27.gif"></p>
<p>which represents a considerable reduction in set-class counts in comparison with 
the previous two examples, reflecting the broader understanding of equivalence 
that arises when <i>M</i> is included. Note in particular that the number of &#8220;interval 
classes&#8221; (set classes of two-element pc-sets) has dropped from six to five; this 
is because the usual ic1 and ic5 are related to each other by <i>M</i> (while the other 
interval classes are preserved under <i>M</i>). The total number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>I</i>/<i>M</i> set classes is only 158.</p>

<p>[68] <i>2.14. Example: T<sub>n</sub>/T<sub>n</sub>I set classes in a 19-note scale</i>. Scales with 19 notes to the octave have received attention for their considerable acoustic and 
structural similarities with the familiar twelve-note system (Mandelbaum 1961). 
If <i>N</i> = 19 rather than 12, there are 38 pc-set operations of the forms <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> and 
<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i>. Although the transformation group is larger than in the twelve-note case, 
the fact that 19 is a prime number simplifies the cycle structure of the 
transformations considerably. In fact, there are only three different cycle 
types: the identity (<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>) is of cycle index <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>19</sup>; the transpositions <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, 
<i>T</i><sub>18</sub> 
are all of type <i>t</i><sub>19</sub><sup>1</sup> (each permuting the nineteen pcs in one large cycle); and 
the inversions <i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>T</i><sub>18</sub><i>I</i> 
are all of type <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup><i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>9</sup> (each fixing one pc while 
exchanging the others in pairs). The P&oacute;lya polynomial is therefore simply</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq28.gif"></p>
<p>which, when expanded, becomes</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq29.gif"></p>
<p>The numbers have increased greatly relative to the twelve-note situation. There 
are 120 tetrachords, almost 2500 nine-note set classes, and 14,310 set classes 
altogether.</p>

<p>[69] <i>2.15. Example: diatonic set classes</i>. Moving in the direction of smaller rather 
than larger scale systems, let us consider the diatonic scale, for which <i>N</i> = 7. 
In the mod-7 system, the identity (<i>T</i><sub>0</sub>) is of cycle index <i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>7</sup>; the transpositions 
<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>T</i><sub>6</sub> are all of type <i>t</i><sub>7</sub><sup>1</sup>; and the inversions <i>I</i>, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub><i>I</i>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>T</i><sub>6</sub><i>I</i> are all of type 
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup><i>t</i><sub>2</sub><sup>3</sup>. The P&oacute;lya polynomial is therefore</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq30.gif"></p>
<p>which reduces to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq31.gif"></p>
<p>If inversion is not considered, the calculation is even simpler:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq32.gif"></p>
<p>In the diatonic world there are only 18 set classes if inversion is considered, 
and only two additional ones if it is not. These diatonic set classes are listed 
in <a href="#clough_1979" id="citation_clough_1979_67dc9b0edd8b9">Clough 1979</a>.</p>

<p>[70] <i>2.16. Some general formulas</i>. We have thus far skirted the question of whether it 
is actually possible to write down a single formula for the number of <i>k</i>-note set 
classes (either <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes or <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes) in an <i>N</i>-note scale system. In 
fact, there is such a formula, but it is not simple.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup>			To derive it one first 
needs a general formula for the cycle index of the cyclic group <i>C<sub>N</sub></i> or the 
dihedral group <i>D<sub>N</sub></i>, as appropriate. Such formulas can be found in the 
combinatorial literature (e.g., <a href="#riordan_1958" id="citation_riordan_1958_67dc9b0edd8bc">Riordan 1958</a>, 149&#8211;50) and will be given here 
without proof.</p>

<p>[71] The cycle index formulas involve Euler&#8217;s <i>&phi;</i> function: for any positive integer <i>n</i>, 
<i>&phi;</i>(<i>n</i>) is defined to be the number of positive integers <i>m</i> &#8804; <i>n</i> that are coprime to <i>n</i> (that is, for which the greatest common divisor of <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> is 1).<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>			Specifically, the cycle index of <i>C<sub>N</sub></i> is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq33.gif"></p>
<p>where the sum is taken over all positive divisors <i>j </i>of <i>N</i>. The cycle index of <i>D<sub>N</sub></i> 
is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq34.gif"></p>
<p>where 
&Phi;<i><sub>N</sub></i> is the cycle index of the cyclic group from the previous formula.</p>

<p>[72] We must then exhibit a formula for the coefficient of <i>x<sup>N</sup></i><sup>&#8211;</sup><i><sup>k</sup>y<sup>k</sup></i> when <i>&alpha;</i><sub><i>j</i></sub> = 
<i>x<sup>j</sup></i> + <i>y</i><i><sup>j</sup></i> 
is substituted for <i>t<sub>j</sub></i> in each of these equations, as P&oacute;lya&#8217;s theorem specifies. 
In the cyclic case, the coefficient of <i>x<sup>N</sup></i><sup>&#8211;</sup><i><sup>k</sup>y<sup>k</sup></i>&#8212;the number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes of <i>k</i>-note 
sets in an <i>N</i>-note scale&#8212;is given by</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq35.gif"></p>
<p>where the sum is taken over all common divisors <i>j</i> of <i>N</i> and <i>k</i>. The quantity in 
the large parentheses on the right is a binomial coefficient, the number of 
combinations of <i>N</i>/<i>j</i> things taken <i>k</i>/<i>j</i> at a time. The corresponding coefficient in 
the dihedral case&#8212;the number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes&#8212;is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq36.gif"></p>
<p>Again, the quantities in the large parentheses are binomial coefficients; 
<img border="0" src="hook_eq37.gif" align="absmiddle"> denotes the largest integer less than or equal to <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>[73] Ambitious readers may use the above formulas to verify some of the results 
discussed previously. For example, in the usual 12-note system there are 43 <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> 
classes of tetrachords (<i>&zeta;</i><sub>12</sub>(4) = 43) and 29 <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes of tetrachords 
(<i>&xi;</i><sub>12</sub>(4) = 29), while in the 19-note system the number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes of 
tetrachords is 120 (<i>&xi;</i><sub>19</sub>(4) = 120). It will be noted that the sums appearing in 
the formulas for &Phi;<sub><i>N</i></sub> and <i>&zeta;</i><sub><i>N</i></sub>(<i>k</i>) involve many terms when the number <i>N</i> has many 
divisors but are much simpler if <i>N</i> is a prime number; this is consistent with 
the relative complexity of our previous calculations in the 12- and 19-note 
cases.</p>

<p>[74] The above formulas have been used to produce <b>Tables 4 and 5</b>, which enumerate the 
<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> and <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes, respectively, of <i>k</i>-note sets in an <i>N</i>-note scale for all 
values of <i>N</i> from 7 to 24. To save space, values are shown only for <i>k</i> &#8804; 12; this 
is sufficient because the number of <i>k</i>-note set classes is the same as the number 
of (<i>N</i> &#8211; <i>k</i>)-note set classes. (In a 19-note scale, for instance, the number of 
15-note set classes does not appear in the table, but it is the same as the 
number of 4-note set classes, which does appear.) The final column gives the 
total number of set classes of all cardinalities for each value of <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>[75] These tables illustrate in dramatic fashion how set classes proliferate as <i>N</i> 
increases. In the quarter-tone system (<i>N</i> = 24), there are more than 350,000 
<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes and almost 700,000 <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes. The latter number is almost twice 
the former; indeed, as <i>N</i> increases, the ratio of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes to <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> classes 
approaches 2, because symmetrical sets become statistically scarcer. Without 
venturing too far into the somewhat contentious question of the &#8220;privileged&#8221; 
nature of the mod-12 system, we may at least note that the usual 224 <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> 
classes, in comparison with the counts in other lines of the tables, are 
sufficient to provide a rich variety of set types while remaining a manageable 
number from the perspective of classification and aural recognition.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup></p>

<p>[76] <i>2.17. Example: beat-class sets</i>. Similarities between pitch and rhythmic 
structures have been widely noted. For example, <a href="#cohn_1992" id="citation_cohn_1992_67dc9b0edd8d3">Cohn 1992</a> and <a href="#roeder_2003" id="citation_roeder_2003_67dc9b0edd8d4">Roeder 2003</a> employ 
<i>beat-class sets</i>, the rhythmic counterpart of pitch-class sets, to study Steve 
Reich&#8217;s phase techniques. Indeed, calculations involving the distribution of <i>k</i> 
attacks in a measure of <i>N</i> beats are completely analogous to calculations 
involving <i>k</i>-note subsets of an <i>N</i>-note system. Rhythmic rotations play the role 
of transpositions, and retrogrades the role of inversions. If rotations (but not 
retrogrades) of a rhythm are considered equivalent, the number of ways to place 
four notes and eight rests (or vice versa) in a twelve-beat measure is <i>&zeta;</i>12(4) = 
<i>&zeta;</i>12(8) = 43 as calculated above. If retrogrades are also considered equivalent, 
the number drops to <i>&xi;</i>12(4) = <i>&xi;</i>12(8) = 29. Reich&#8217;s <i>Clapping Music</i> in fact 
consists of rotations of a twelve-beat rhythm with eight attacks. <a href="#haack_1991" id="citation_haack_1991_67dc9b0edd8d6">Haack 1991</a> applies combinatorial techniques to this piece, considering some of the 
properties of the particular rhythm chosen by Reich and exploring how many other 
rhythms might have been equally suitable.</p>

<p>[77] <i>2.18. Example: twelve-tone rows, revisited</i>. In section 1.3 we observed that the 
total number of twelve-tone rows is 12!, and that the number of row classes in 
classical serial theory is approximately, but not exactly, 1/48 of that number. 
We now consider ways to make the latter calculation precise.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup>The group of equivalences is of order 48, consisting of all transposition, inversion, and 
retrograde operations. It is possible to calculate how many of the 12! rows are 
fixed by each of these 48 transformations, and thereby to calculate the number 
of orbits using Burnside&#8217;s Lemma. The process can be simplified considerably, 
however, because the twelve transpositions of a row are always distinct: no rows 
are fixed by <i>T<sub>j</sub></i> for <i>j</i> &#8800; 0. Because of this observation, transposition can be 
effectively eliminated from the calculation. Instead of considering the 12! rows 
acted upon by a group of order 48, we consider only the 11! <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes of rows 
acted upon by a group of order 4 consisting of <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> (the identity), <i>I</i>, 
<i>R</i>, and <i>RI </i>(= <i>IR</i>). Each <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> class consists of exactly twelve rows, and may be represented by 
a single row that starts with 0. The number of orbits of the <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes in this 
simplified setting is the same as the number of orbits of rows in the original 
situation.</p>

<p>[78] To apply Burnside&#8217;s Lemma we must determine how many <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes are fixed by each of the four transformations in the group. Clearly <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> fixes all 11! <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes, and <i>I</i> fixes none (an inverted form of a row can never be a 
transposition of the original row). For a <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> class represented by a row (0, 
<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, 
<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>) to be fixed by <i>R</i>, the retrograde (<i>a</i><sub>11</sub>, 
<i>a</i><sub>10</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, 0) must be some 
transposition <i>T<sub>j</sub></i> of the row. That is, for some <i>j</i>, the twelve equations</p>
<p style="text-align: center">0 + <i>j</i> = <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>j</i> = 
<i>a</i><sub>10</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> + <i>j</i> = 0</p>
<p>all hold (mod 12). The first equation says that <i>j</i> = <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>; then the last equation 
implies that <i>j</i> = <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> = 6. (It cannot be 0, since 0 is the first note of the row 
and <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> is the last.) Retrograde symmetry, therefore, is possible only at the 
tritone transposition <i>T</i><sub>6</sub>. The second note <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> may be chosen freely from the 
remaining ten pcs (besides 0 and <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> = 6), but then <i>a</i><sub>10</sub> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + 6 is determined. 
Continuing in this way, there are eight choices for the third note, six for the 
fourth, four for the fifth, and two for the sixth, and the second half of the 
row is determined by these choices. The number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes fixed by <i>R</i>, 
therefore, is 10 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 6 &#0183; 4 &#0183; 2 = 3840. These classes represent only a tiny fraction of 
the 11! possible <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes, but the rows of Berg&#8217;s 
<i>Lyric Suite </i>and Webern&#8217;s 
Symphony, Op. 21 are of this type.</p>

<p>[79] Finally, if a <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> class represented by (0, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>a</i><sub>11</sub>) is fixed by <i>RI</i>, the 
equations become</p>
<p style="text-align: center">0 + <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> = <i>j</i>, <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>10</sub> = <i>j</i>, <nobr>. . .</nobr>, <i>a</i><sub>5</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>6</sub> = <i>j</i></p>
<p>for some <i>j</i>. Even values of <i>j</i> are impossible: indeed, if <i>j</i> = 2<i>i</i>, then the pitch 
class <i>i</i> can have no partner with which to sum to <i>j</i>, as the equations require. 
For any of the six odd values of <i>j</i>, however, the situation is similar to that in 
the previous paragraph: <i>a</i><sub>11</sub> is determined; <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> can then be chosen from ten 
options, thereby determining <i>a</i><sub>10</sub>; and so on. The number of <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes fixed by 
<i>RI</i> is therefore 6 &#0183; 10 &#0183; 8 &#0183; 6 &#0183; 4 &#0183; 2 = 23,040. These classes are theoretically six times 
as numerous as the <i>R</i>-invariant classes but still rare among all <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> classes; the 
rows of Webern&#8217;s String Quartet, Op. 28, Cantata, Op. 29, and Variations, Op. 30 
are all of this type.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>

<p>[80] By Burnside&#8217;s Lemma, then, the total number of row classes is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq38.gif"></p>
<p>It is not difficult to show, using methods similar to the above, that the number 
of row classes in an <i>N</i>-note scale is</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img border="0" src="hook_eq39.gif"></p>

<p>[81] <i>2.19. Further examples and conclusions</i>. Fripertinger (1993, 5) shows that if <i>N</i> 
is even, the number of self-complementary <i>N</i>/2-note set classes may be calculated 
as <i>P<sub>G</sub></i>(0, 2, 0, 2, <nobr>. . .</nobr>)&#8212;that is, by alternately substituting 0 and 2 for the 
variables <i>t<sub>j</sub></i> in the cycle index of the group of equivalences (which as usual may 
be either <i>C<sub>N</sub></i> or <i>D<sub>N</sub></i>). One can use this formula together with the cycle index 
formulas given previously to verify that for <i>N</i> = 12 the number of 
self-complementary hexachords is 8 if the group of equivalences is <i>C<sub>N</sub></i> (that is, 
eight <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> types of hexachords are related to their complements by some <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>), or 20 
if the group is <i>D<sub>N</sub></i> (twenty <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i>/<i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i> types of hexachords are related to their 
complements by some <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub></i> and/or <i>T<sub><i>n</i></sub>I</i>).</p>

<p>[82] <a href="#fripertinger_1992_1993" id="citation_fripertinger_1992_1993_67dc9b0edd8e7">Fripertinger 1992, 1993</a> and <a href="#read_1997" id="citation_read_1997_67dc9b0edd8e8">Read 1997</a> give many additional examples of advanced 
calculations. Among the phenomena for which Fripertinger devises methods of 
enumeration are <i>k</i>-note row classes mod <i>N</i> (pages 11&#8211;12); all-interval rows (pages 
13&#8211;17); &#8220;motifs&#8221; involving both pitch and rhythm (pages 18&#8211;20); and Hauer&#8217;s tropes 
(pages 20&#8211;21). Read (<a href="#read_1997" id="citation_read_1997_67dc9b0edd8ea">1997</a>, 547) enumerates row classes if the group of 
equivalences is expanded to include rotations. (For <i>N</i> = 12 in this situation, 
the group is of order 48 &#0183; 12 = 576, and the number of row classes is 836,017. As 
we should expect, this number is slightly more than 1/12 of the number 
calculated in the previous section: the size of the group has increased by a 
factor of exactly 12, but the number of row classes is not precisely divided by 
12 because a small number of the original row classes are fixed by some nonzero 
rotation.)</p>

<p>[83] In what may be the most Herculean feat of music-theoretic enumeration on record, 
Read (<a href="#read_1997" id="citation_read_1997_67dc9b0edd8eb">1997</a>, 548&#8211;51) takes on Stockhausen&#8217;s <i>Klavierst&uuml;ck XI</i>, in which the 
performer is asked to make successive random choices among 19 fragments of music 
subject to certain constraints. Through several pages of work with enumeration 
functions, Read calculates the number of different possible performances of the 
piece to be no less than</p>
<p style="text-align: center">17,423,935,148,332,958,167,310,127,282,862,901,334,594.</p>
<p>Perhaps of more practical interest than this vast number are Read&#8217;s observations 
about the lengths of the possible performances. The rules imply that the longest 
possible performance consists of 39 fragments; it turns out that most of the 
possible performances are close to this maximum length, and in fact the average 
length of all the possible performances is just over 38 fragments. (This 
situation recalls a much simpler observation from section 1.2, where we noted 
that of the melodies with no more than six notes, the great majority have 
<i>exactly</i> six notes. As was the case there, an enumeration of configurations of 
variable size is dominated by the configurations of the largest possible size.)</p>

<p>[84] The extravagance of such a calculation recalls the work of Riepel and Galeazzi, 
who saw immense numbers of possibilities as potential stimuli for musical 
creativity. Whether one subscribes to this view or not, the recent resurgence in 
applications of combinatorics to music theory at least aids our understanding of 
music in several ways. Combinatorial methods offer ways to understand simple and 
not-so-simple numerical patterns that arise naturally in the discipline, and 
provide answers to a wide variety of enumeration questions. Familiar concepts 
are seen in new light, as for instance when a tedious brute-force listing is 
superseded by an elegant (if esoteric) enumeration procedure, or when early 
attempts at pc-set classification are reconsidered in the context of groups of 
equivalences and the corresponding enumeration problems. The methodology 
employed in these calculations ranges from elementary observations to recent 
techniques of considerable sophistication, but all of it reaffirms and 
strengthens the long-standing bond between music and mathematics.</p>

Calculation of <i>&phi;</i> is simplified by the following multiplicative property: if <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are coprime, then <i>&phi;</i>(<i>mn</i>) = <i>&phi;</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>&phi;</i>(<i>n</i>). For example, 3 and 8 are coprime; <i>&phi;</i>(3) = 2 because the two integers 1 and 2 are both coprime to 3; <i>&phi;</i>(8) = 4 because the four integers 1, 3, 5, and 7 are each coprime to 8; and therefore <i>&phi;</i>(24) = <i>&phi;</i>(3  &#0183; 8) = <i>&phi;</i>(3)  &#0183;

Galeazzi constructs lengthy melodies in several stages, first choosing a few notes literally at random and eventually superimposing other elements such as rhythm. He calculates the possibilities for melodies available by his method to be an immense number of 24 digits.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">The <i>Musikalische W&uuml;rfelspiel</i> attributed to Mozart was published in 1793 and reprinted under his name by B. Schott, Mainz, in 1956. Dice games are discussed in more detail in <a href="#ratner_1970" id="citation_ratner_1970_67dc9b0ed7690">Ratner 1970</a>. Several online implementations of dice games are available.

P. E. Bach&#8217;s 
<i>Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Takten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen</i> of 1757 is based not upon a harmonic pattern but upon a two-voice contrapuntal model. Bach&#8217;s method, in which the two voices are generated independently, is described in detail in <a href="#helm_1966" id="citation_helm_1966_67dc9b0ed7697">Helm 1966</a>. Helm calculates that the game produces 912 = 282,429,536,481 possible compositions, but this calculation overlooks the fact that the nine versions of the lower voice in the last measure are identical; the correct total is 911 = 31,381,059,609.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Transformation groups have enjoyed wide exposure in music theory through the work of David Lewin (<a href="#lewin_1987" id="citation_lewin_1987_67dc9b0ed769c">1987</a>) and his many followers. For basic group theory the reader may consult any abstract algebra text such as <a href="#dummit_and_foote_2004" id="citation_dummit_and_foote_2004_67dc9b0ed76a0">Dummit and Foote 2004</a>.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Burnside&#8217;s Lemma is named for William S. Burnside, who published it in 1897, but the result was known to earlier mathematicians, notably Augustin Cauchy as early as the 1840s.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Hungarian-born mathematician George P&oacute;lya (1887&#8211;1985) made important contributions to many branches of mathematics. Renowned also as a teacher and writer, P&oacute;lya authored the widely-read and often-reprinted book of problem-solving strategies titled <i>How to Solve It</i> (<a href="#p&oacute;lya_2004" id="citation_p&oacute;lya_2004_67dc9b0ed76a4">2004</a>). P&oacute;lya published the enumeration theorem in <a href="#p&oacute;lya_1937" id="citation_p&oacute;lya_1937_67dc9b0ed76a7">1937</a>, motivated by a problem in chemistry: his goal was to enumerate chemical compounds subject to various constraints on molecular structure. P&oacute;lya&#8217;s own approach to teaching combinatorics is described in <a href="#p&oacute;lya_tarjan_and_woods_1983" id="citation_p&oacute;lya_tarjan_and_woods_1983_67dc9b0ed76ac">P&oacute;lya, Tarjan, and Woods 1983</a>.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">These formulas appear in <a href="#reiner_1985" id="citation_reiner_1985_67dc9b0ed76af">Reiner 1985</a>, 52&#8211;53 and <a href="#fripertinger_1992_1993" id="citation_fripertinger_1992_1993_67dc9b0ed76b4">Fripertinger 1992, 1993</a>, 4. Reiner&#8217;s formula for the cycle index of the dihedral group contains a misprint; the formula given here is correct.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">The function <i>&phi;</i> is well-known in number theory and has many interesting properties and applications; see <a href="#hardy_and_wright_1979" id="citation_hardy_and_wright_1979_67dc9b0ed76b7">Hardy and Wright 1979</a>, 54ff. Calculation of <i>&phi;</i> is simplified by the following multiplicative property: if <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are coprime, then <i>&phi;</i>(<i>mn</i>) = <i>&phi;</i>(<i>m</i>)<i>&phi;</i>(<i>n</i>). For example, 3 and 8 are coprime; <i>&phi;</i>(3) = 2 because the two integers 1 and 2 are both coprime to 3; <i>&phi;</i>(8) = 4 because the four integers 1, 3, 5, and 7 are each coprime to 8; and therefore <i>&phi;</i>(24) = <i>&phi;</i>(3  &#0183; 8) = <i>&phi;</i>(3)  &#0183; 
<i>&phi;</i></i>(8) = 2  &#0183; 4 = 8. Indeed, the eight integers &#8804; 24 that are coprime to 24 are 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">Mandelbaum (<a href="#mandelbaum_1961" id="citation_mandelbaum_1961_67dc9b0ed76ba">1961</a>, 251) has proposed that &#8220;it is conceivable that there was a point around . . . Zarlino&#8217;s time when music might have evolved as easily toward 19-tone temperament as toward 12-.&#8221; It is interesting to speculate about how much more difficult the classification of pc-sets would have been had such a scenario come to pass.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">The number of row classes can be calculated by elementary means in rather painstaking fashion. Whether a row class consists of 24 or 48 rows depends on the symmetry of the two hexachords. It is possible to determine, for each of the 50 hexachord classes, how many row classes of each cardinality arise. The much shorter calculation presented here, using Burnside&#8217;s Lemma, is based on <a href="#reiner_1985" id="citation_reiner_1985_67dc9b0ed76be">Reiner 1985</a>. A rather different algebraic proof appears in <a href="#hunter_and_von_hippel_2003" id="citation_hunter_and_von_hippel_2003_67dc9b0ed76c1">Hunter and von Hippel 2003</a>, 129.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#hunter_and_von_hippel_2003" id="citation_hunter_and_von_hippel_2003_67dc9b0ed76c4">Hunter and von Hippel 2003</a> offer statistical confirmation that twelve-tone composers choose symmetrical rows far more often than random selection would dictate.</div>
