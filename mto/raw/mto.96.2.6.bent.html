<p><b><i>A mind is like a parachute. It only works if it is open</i>.</b></p>
<hr><br>

<p>[1] I am grateful to Roger Wibberley and other 
correspondents following his article in <i>MTO</i><sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> for airing 
some important questions and providing me with an incentive 
for this reply. I do plan eventually to produce a more 
fully revised and corrected expansion of the thesis I set 
out in &ldquo;Diatonic <i>ficta</i>&rdquo; (henceforth DF),<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> incorporating 
replies to Karol Berger and Peter Urquhart, but 
this may serve as a partial, interim statement.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p>

[2] Cristle Collins Judd began her posting of July 23 to
mto-talk (&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO 2.5,&rdquo; <a href="http://societymusictheory.org/www-talk/mto/96july.mto/0032.html">mto-talk 23 July 1996</a>) by
addressing not so much Wibberley&rsquo;s solution but his modal
premises.  In order to restore premises rather than symptoms to
the centre of the discussion, I shall first set the Josquin
aside.  Since some readers may not be familiar with DF and the
context in which I used that example, and since none will be able
to infer it correctly from Wibberley&rsquo;s article, it might be
helpful if I now restate and amplify some parts (only) of the
thesis particularly germane to this discussion, and take this
opportunity to adjust some areas where my presentation may have
proved incomplete or too elliptical.
<p>

[3] Since I invoke counterpoint so strongly, I had better 
explain the specific sense in which I use the term. 
Counterpoint, as defined in DF from Tinctoris and earlier 
theorists, is concerned not with lines or vague general 
attributes but with <i>two-voice</i> progressions&mdash;what <i>we</i> 
might call two-part or <i>dyadic harmony</i>.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> At least up to 
the late 15th century, the handling of more than two parts 
was treated by theorists as an extension of those dyadic 
principles. It is in respecting and reconciling melodic 
principles and the rules of counterpoint that ficta is 
necessitated; I have tried to show that ficta needs to be 
viewed in the context of counterpoint as a whole, and not 
informed just by precepts specifically labelled as ficta. 
The list discussion has referred to the need to set 
priorities in cases of conflicting principles (Judd, 23 
July: &ldquo;the challenge to Bent&rsquo;s solution of the passage in 
question comes not from modal theory, but in relation to 
how one interprets horizontal and vertical priorities in 
determining ficta.&rdquo; Just so.).  I did indeed attempt<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> to 
draw from theorists a set of primary guidelines for 
applying contrapuntal precepts (melodic and &ldquo;harmonic&rdquo;) 
precisely with a view to setting priorities when those 
precepts come into conflict, though there is still a long 
way to go in spelling out qualifications, exceptions and 
licences to those primary considerations, some of which 
have been addressed by Berger and Urquhart.
<p>

[4] A fundamental difference between renaissance notation 
and ours is that, then, &ldquo;not to notate accidentals is not 
to misnotate the music.&rdquo;  Notated accidentals were truly 
accidental. No more or less importance attaches to their 
prescriptive power or indeed to their absence than would, 
say, to that of sporadic fingerings in some early keyboard 
sources.  We may be glad of help, however occasional or 
eccentric, but notation should not be viewed as incomplete 
or inaccurate when lacking such accidental indications. 
When we transcribe old music into a notation in which 
accidentals have become essential, we tend to read the 
notation thus transcribed as a stronger default than it 
ever could have been, one from which &ldquo;deviations&rdquo; have to 
be justified and to which accidentals have to be added, or 
notes inflected. It is we, <i>not they</i>, who &ldquo;add 
accidentals,&rdquo; depart from the notation, and make 
inflections.  They had no term to distinguish our F flat 
from F: if a note was F according to the clef, it was still 
&ldquo;F,&rdquo; even F fa ut, <i>even if</i> it had become our &ldquo;F flat&rdquo; by 
local contrapuntal operations. This is what I shall mean by 
the term &ldquo;contrapuntal descent&rdquo; (see [8]), as distinct from 
a descent caused by tuning.
<p>

[5] It is the modern transcription that has traditionally 
been treated as our default, as when we refer to &ldquo;the 
notation as it stands,&rdquo; or at &ldquo;face value,&rdquo; despite 
changing standards in editorial practice. After 
considerable editorial experience, it is now my conviction 
that so to treat it is a greater disfigurement and source 
of misprision than to start from the other end, as I now 
advocate. It is obvious that <i>their</i> starting point for 
these determinations, <i>their</i> access to the music, was not 
from a modern transcription but rather through singing from 
their manuscripts and prints. Early notation provided a 
weak intervallic default organization by clef and 
signature, but because it was incompletely prescriptive of 
pitch (hence &ldquo;weak default&rdquo;), the performer expected to 
arrive at actual sounds by some means besides prescriptive 
notation. Modes and hexachords (see [18] below), while very 
important for other purposes, run on separate tracks from 
each other and are at best marginally relevant to the 
realization of counterpoint and the determination of ficta. 
The most important key to successful realization of weakly 
prescriptive notation is to complement it as they must have 
done, armed with an approximation of the elementary 
training shared by composers and singers, and which 
composers presumed in their singers when they committed 
their compositions to notation, namely, for these purposes, 
practical training in counterpoint. Taken in partnership, 
notation and counterpoint create a more strongly 
prescriptive basis for realization. Like them, we should 
develop the (for us very different) musical skills that are 
dictated by singing from the original, acquiring an 
awareness of the constraints and freedoms inherent in the 
notation, as well as a sense of the violence done by 
putting weak-default (early) notation (without the 
complement of a strengthening counterpoint training) into a 
(modern) form that demands to be read by the standards of 
modern notation as a &ldquo;strong&rdquo; default.  DF grew out of a 
recognition that the answers to many of these questions 
follow naturally from the experience of reading and singing 
from original notation instead of from conceptually 
different modern translations. If this is a counsel of 
perfection, we need at least to learn (by doing it) to 
<i>simulate</i> that experience so that in using modern scores 
we can make all allowance for their inherent distortions, 
as one glimpses the original  language through the 
shortcomings of a translation. It is those earlier habits 
that (echoing Crocker 1962) we need to recover, by reading 
their books (musical and theoretical) rather than ours, by 
observing what they don&rsquo;t say as well as what they do.
<p>

[6] Armed with the rudiments of mensural and contrapuntal 
skills (correct realization of perfect simultaneities and 
cadential approaches in discant-tenor pairs, and perfection 
of melodic 4ths and 5ths unless prevented), one <i>reads</i> 
one&rsquo;s own part in a state of readiness to re-interpret, of 
readiness to change one&rsquo;s <i>expectation</i> of how to read the 
under-prescriptive notation (not to <i>change the notation!</i>) 
in prompt reaction to what one <i>hears</i>.  The &ldquo;default&rdquo; of 
the line you <i>see</i>, together with the melodic articulations 
you expect to apply (perfecting linear fourths, making 
cadential semitones) is controlled and sometimes over-ruled 
by the counterpoint you <i>hear</i>. The &ldquo;default&rdquo; that is 
&ldquo;changed&rdquo; is not the <i>notation as transcribed</i>, but the 
<i>expectation</i> of how the original notation is to be 
realized.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Once the new (i.e. old) 
habits of listening 
and adjusting aurally have been internalized, most 
solutions follow naturally, and almost never require the 
lengthy discussions that arise when singing from 
transcribed score. I fear that I am now as skeptical of the 
authority of assertions about what is and is not possible 
in early polyphony, from those who have not acquired 
fluency in reading in this way, as I would be reluctant to 
accept literary correction from someone who read a language 
only in translation.  The weak default of under-
prescriptive notation becomes a strong default when coupled 
with contrapuntal training, but it is a different strong 
default from modern, mostly white-note, notation &ldquo;as it 
stands,&rdquo; and the inherent status accorded accidentals by 
current editorial conventions.
<p>

[7] We are still free to treat results so obtained as a 
default that can or must be departed from, but this default 
is as different as it could be from that of a modern 
transcription. We will approach their thinking and 
musicianship more closely by trying to do it their way (the 
Kon-Tiki principle of testing whether the expedition is 
possible using the original equipment), even if the results 
turn out to be very different from what we have grown used 
to by doing it from the opposite, unquestionably 
anachronistic direction, and even if we then decided (on 
grounds <i>yet to be determined</i>, since &ldquo;modal fidelity,&rdquo; 
<i>pace</i> Wibberley, will no longer do) that the new results need 
further adjustments of a different kind.  
<p>
 
[8] Our musical culture has raised the definition of 
frequency and pitch-class to a high status, for analysis, 
editing and performance. My reading of a range of early 
theorists leads me to posit a slightly fuzzier status both 
for what we would call pitch-class and for frequency, a 
status that places pitch closer to the more flexible view 
of durations and tempo that we still have. This reading 
rests partly on conspicuous circumlocutions and the late 
arrival of precise language, notation and measurement, 
partly on a pervasive Pythagorean mentality expressed in 
the tuning system, partly on my understanding of 
counterpoint and the internal evidence of some paradigmatic 
pieces, <i>not</i> the Josquin. We routinely make <i>rhythmic and 
durational</i> analyses on the basis of notated values even 
though we know that performance fluctuations, some 
necessary, some elective, expected but elusive to precise 
definition, are ignored by the analyst. We are not 
necessarily shocked if an analysis disregards the fact that 
a piece, any piece, may end slower than it began. A 
terminal ritardando needn&rsquo;t affect certain kinds of 
analysis; nor need the ritardando of pitch caused by a 
logical downward sequential spiral (Obrecht) shock us. I do 
not assume, as Wibberley seems to impute [2], that for the 
&ldquo;Obrecht piece to begin on F and end on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> was of little if 
any consequence for the singers.&rdquo; By suggesting that if 
they <i>knew</i> they were spiralling for reasons either of 
tuning or counterpoint (if I understand him correctly) they 
would have found a way not to do so, Wibberley subscribes to a 
rigid frequency stability which, however well established 
it became in the keyboard-reference era, did not, I 
believe, govern earlier music (see especially [13] below). 
Without cumbersome advance planning, I maintain that it is 
virtually impossible to sing the Obrecht <i>Libenter 
gloriabor</i> Kyrie (and about 30 other pieces) from original 
notation in any other artful way than to let the sequence, 
indeed, wind smoothly down in its <i>contrapuntal</i> operation 
(irrespective of the tuning used, even if that were equal 
temperament). This happened in one of our singing sessions 
when someone innocent of its notoriety brought a facsimile 
along. We read it, it descended, as everyone was (and 
always would have been) well aware as it was happening. The 
sequence of descending fifths and rising fourths F B E A D 
G C F is notated only with a few encouraging B and E flats, 
but its smooth counterpoint locks it into &mdash; in our terms, 
F <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> (see DF, 34&ndash;40).  Another of us, who 
had previously been sceptical of &ldquo;my&rdquo; solution on paper, 
exclaimed with surprise that it sounded fine. That is 
precisely the point. Try it!
<p>

[9] Nor need such a spiral impinge on, <i>pace</i> Wibberley, a modal 
analysis. The work by Powers and Judd on Aaron&rsquo;s modal 
assignations<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> makes it clear that 
Aaron in the <i>Trattato</i> 
was indeed making those assignations &ldquo;on paper,&rdquo; in such a 
way as to permit two startlingly different-sounding pieces 
(such as <i>Mon mari m&rsquo;a diffame</i> by De Orto and <i>E la la la</i> 
by Ninot le Petit, nos. 12 and 27 in Canti B) to receive 
the same classification. (How, for example, does Wibberley deal 
with such witness or advocacy of mode?) This is closer in 
time to Josquin than Glareanus and should restrain Wibberley&rsquo;s 
construction of the relevance of (his perception of 
Glarean&rsquo;s view of) mode to the sound (= contrapuntal 
realization) of a piece. The relatively higher status we 
now accord to sounding pitch definition is reflected in the 
facts that we (not they) have made accidentals essential, 
and that we fix frequency and pitch class much more sharply 
than we do metronomic values. Pitch, in short, has a higher 
status for us than rhythm. Skilled singers <i>of course</i> 
would be aware of changes, both at the micro-level of 
tuning, shifting commas of intonation, and at the macro-
level of occasional contrapuntal spiralling sequences such 
as I believe to be indisputable in the Willaert and 
unavoidable in the Obrecht examples.
<p>

[10] Berger (in <i>Musica ficta</i>) was unwilling to accept the 
evolution of his &ldquo;renaissance&rdquo; view of a keyboard-like 
repertory of available pitches from my free-standing, 
vocally-conceived, Pythagorean, pre-keyboard &ldquo;medieval&rdquo; 
view of pitch, tuning and vocal counterpoint. Indeed, he 
(like Wibberley) is reluctant to accept any possibility of 
fluctuation, by tuning or counterpoint, and there we 
differ. I believe that Berger&rsquo;s view is broadly valid for a 
later period and with different qualifications from those 
to which he applies it, and that it can at some point be 
reconciled with mine, though not as a background to music 
before 1500, where I judge it to be anachronistic. I wrote: 
&ldquo;Musica recta is not an arsenal of fixed pitches but 
denotes a set of relationships to a notional norm of pitch 
stability that is more like a flotilla at anchor than a 
Procrustean bed or a pre-tuned keyboard. The &lsquo;operation of 
<i>musica ficta</i>&rsquo;, that is, the substitution at any point, 
for contrapuntal reasons, of a tone for a semitone (or vice 
versa), could mean that the absolute frequency of the As, 
Bs, Cs that follow may not be the same as they were before, 
although the local interval relationships of small segments 
will remain intact. The taking of a <i>conjuncta</i> 
(substitution of a tone for a semitone or vice versa) 
anywhere in the system may change the actual pitches 
following that point, without changing the relationships 
except at that point. The value of a semibreve may be 
changed by proportional operation or mensural change; the 
contextual relationships of that semibreve will continue to 
be observed after the point of change even if the absolute 
durations represented by the same symbol in the same 
context are different from before. Both for mensuration and 
for pitch, the values are achieved through local context 
and without reference to long-term absolutes.&rdquo; (DF p. 10, and 
passim.)  Especially since the Powers-Judd illumination of 
renaissance views of mode, it has yet to be shown that 
there is any basis other than modern prejudice for claiming 
such absolutes with respect to sounding pitch, as distinct 
from notated status, for a musicianship that was not yet, 
before the 16th century, bound by keyboard-like reference. 
It is the notion of frequency volatility of both these 
kinds that has already educed the loudest howls of protest 
(e.g. from Berger, p. 45). This is a genuine point of 
disagreement, much more fundamental than the Josquin 
example. That singers were aware of these shifts does not 
prove (again, <i>pace</i> Wibberley and Berger) that they would have found 
them undesirable or striven to avoid them. Before about 
1500, and often afterwards, there is nothing to constrain a 
piece to a fixed frequency or, in certain special 
circumstances, to a fixed constancy irrespective of tuning, 
for a letter-name-plus-hexachord syllable point on the 
gamut; these fixities are what I see as coming in with the 
rise of the keyboard as instrument of practical and 
theoretical reference. They would have been as ready, I 
believe (as we are not), to redefine a frequency or, as in 
the Willaert, to adopt a changed but logically-approached 
pitch for E, as to accept (as we can without special 
pleading) a new value for a semibreve beat after a 
proportional shift, whether specified or otherwise 
necessitated.
<p>

[11] Diatonic (and hence also chromatic) status  was 
defined <i>melodically</i> in the 16th century and earlier.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
The presence of sharps and flats does not necessarily 
render music chromatic; diatonic status then, as later, is 
not confined to &ldquo;white notes.&rdquo;  F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> is a chromatic, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;G a 
diatonic semitone, <i>irrespective of the size or tuning of

semitones.  This or any melodic progression that proceeds 
by diatonic intervals (e.g. the tenor of the Willaert duo) 
is diatonic. Most ficta is diatonic, hence &ldquo;Diatonic 
ficta.&rdquo; I did not intend the apparently paradoxical title 
as a label for exotic procedures;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
rather, I used some 
unusual pieces to illustrate how far diatonicism can go, in 
order to demonstrate how some modern scholarship has 
misused the term in relation to early music, and to bring 
out the different underlying assumptions and the different 
prescriptive power of old and new notation respectively. I 
am pleased to note in the recent discussion that most 
correspondents avoid indiscriminately calling sharps and 
flats chromatic, and thus tacitly acquiesce in the view 
that, except for specifically chromatic intervals such as 
F&ndash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, ficta was largely diatonic.
<p>

[12] I have read with interest the mto-talk postings of Nicolaus
Meeus on tuning and intonation (&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO 2.5,&rdquo; <a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0005.html">mto-talk
19 August 1996</a>, <a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0011.html">mto-talk 26 
August 1996</a>).  He rightly surmises that I believe some
kind of just intonation (with pure 5ths and 8ves) applied to <i>a
cappella</i> vocal counterpoint &ldquo;with pure intonation, Pythagorean
in principle [Meeus and Lindley also use this qualification], but
probably with justly tempered thirds in practice&rdquo; (DF p.  18).
However, Meeus&rsquo;s view of tuning is so clearly anchored to a
sophisticated keyboard-equivalent that, in setting a standard of
reference for a piece or a passage, it comes at the discussion
from the opposite direction from mine.  As for adjustments <i>on</i>
dissonances, the frequent pitch redefinitions that result from a
Pythagorean approach (as I understand it; see next para.)  result
in no bumps, no audible local dislocations.
<p>

[13] It is highly significant that there was no standard
<i>starting point</i> for tuning the Pythagorean monochord.  In DF I
presented Pythagorean tuning as the antithesis of keyboard
reference:  &ldquo;even if two monochords were tuned with true
Pythagorean ratios, their resulting frequencies could be slightly
different if those ratios were applied from a unison by a
different route through the spiral of fifths.&rdquo;  (See DF,
especially 3&ndash;7.)  The monochord was unsuitable as an accompanying
instrument; apart from very elementary pedagogic use, it was a
representation of Pythagorean ratios rather than a proto-keyboard
for an individual performance; this of course allows for the kind
of disciplined frequency movement I believe to be endemic to
their thinking, hence the Pythagorean spiral, not circle, of
fifths.  The monochord <i>represented</i> the proportions that yielded
those sounds, but in practice (by pure 5/4 thirds) may have been
on a slightly different track from them (separate tracks, yet
again).  I believe that the view of a constantly redefining
Pythagorean application overcomes the rejection (by Meeus,
<a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0011.html">mto-talk 26 August</a>, and 
implicitly by many others) of
Pythagorean tuning throughout the very period where it is
prevalent, and the point of theoretical reference for proportions
of all kinds.  Indeed, the better in tune a performance sounds in
terms of its local progressions (with pure thirds and fifths),
the more likely it is to move down, as several professional
performers confirm.  It is a short step from here to believe, as
I do, that Pythagorean intonation was <i>constantly redefinable</i>
around new central notes in the course of a piece.  The arrival
on each new true fifth sonority would then be the new point of
departure for purposes of tuning calculations, thus achieving
local perfection and a smooth, gradual descent by comma
increments.  This rules out a notional keyboard standard for
performance; any performance <i>with</i> a keyboard necessitated
compromises, a fact that exercised several 16th-century
theorists.  The final sequence of a piece like <i>Absalom</i>, in
which (I believe) pure (Pythagorean) fifths would, ideally at
least, have been mediated by pure 3rds (5/4) which in turn anchor
the next pure fifths of the sequence, is almost bound to end at a
fractionally lower frequency unless it is (artificially, and
irrelevantly for this discussion) disciplined by adherence to a
pre-tuned keyboard standard or repertory of available pitches
(Berger&rsquo;s view).
<p>

[14] If you believe, with Lowinsky, that frequency must 
have been constant, a musical absolute (as if to be 
accompanied on equal-tempered or fretted instruments), then 
obviously pieces such as the Willaert duo and Greiter&rsquo;s 
<i>Fortuna</i> can be regarded, as he did, as precocious 
manifestos for equal temperament.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> He was prepared to 
accept <i>contrapuntal</i> descent under certain conditions, but 
not frequency descent. By contrapuntal descent, I mean 
pieces like the Obrecht and Willaert examples (see DF) and 
the Greiter where <i>even with constant frequency</i> the &ldquo;F&rdquo; at 
the end is, by purely contrapuntal  spiralling,  one or 
more semitones lower than the &ldquo;F&rdquo; at the beginning. If you 
believe, with me, that (1) such logical <i>contrapuntal</i> and 
melodic descent through the spiral of fifths in these 
pieces is inherently Pythagorean in concept and (2) that 
Pythagorean <i>tuning</i> of 5ths in practice, with pure 3rds 
(5/4), was predisposed to result in comma slippage, pieces 
which thus descend <i>contrapuntally</i> can be construed as (in 
these cases, late) manifestos of Pythagorean conception and 
execution, as posited above. Rejection of <i>any</i> degree of 
frequency volatility obviously makes it harder to overcome 
resistance to contrapuntal descent, despite the existence 
of pieces (Willaert, Greiter) where all are agreed that it 
<i>must</i> happen. Otherwise, the tuning consideration need not 
be an impediment to considering other premises of this 
argument (notably contrapuntal correction) independently of 
a specific tuning system.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup><p>

[15] Now for a confessional review of some miscalculations 
in DF, and a further unpacking of some ellipses. First, it 
was misleading to present my examples in modern score. I 
should never have expected readers to accept, even 
hypothetically, a paradigm shift that emphasizes the 
radical difference between old and new notation while at 
the same time transcribing the examples in such a way as to 
imply that they are equivalent, and exposing them to all 
the shock of unfamiliarity, and to conceptually foreign 
analyses of their tonality and tuning. As I put it, 
&ldquo;neglect of some primary musical facts has led us to 
tolerate the aural dissonance of intolerable intervals 
before we accept the merely graphic dissonance of an 
intolerable-looking modern score.&rdquo; (DF p. 48.) My examples 
in DF should, rather, be seen as &ldquo;phonetic&rdquo; approximations, 
into a different language, of what might be sung from the 
original, or might be at least the first default so 
derived. But it is hard to know what else to do. It is 
unrealistic to assume that readers will have the training 
or time to get together to sing examples from parts, the 
counsel of perfection spelled out above, thus simulating 
the <i>process</i> by which contrapuntal training was applied to 
notated music, but modern scores might at least be read 
with that awareness.
<p>

[16] Since DF I&rsquo;ve had the benefit of reading and 
discussing recent developments in work on mode, especially 
by Powers and Judd, and I would now reformulate some of 
what I said about mode in the light of that, though the 
basic disconnection, on which Judd and I agree, is not much 
affected. For the moment, I will confine myself to quoting 
her clear statements to the mto-talk discussion: (23 July) 
&ldquo;there is simply no need for mode or ficta to impinge one 
upon the other because they occupy different conceptual and 
theoretical realms,&rdquo; and, after quoting Wibberley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Only by this 
means [retaining some diminished fifths in performance] 
would it have been possible to remain faithful to the mode 
on account of the actual notes Josquin composed in the 
particular combination chosen by him,&rdquo; Judd continues: Wibberley&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;conclusion is based on a modern understanding of mode as 
tonal system.  Nowhere is such a view articulated by 
Glarean.  Such a view fundamentally misrepresents the very 
nature of musica ficta in seeking to fix pitches in a way 
that Renaissance musicians clearly did not.  Although 
Bent&rsquo;s solution is not one that I would adopt for this 
passage, there is nothing in the Glarean passage quoted by 
Wibberley in para. 9 to argue against it.  Wibberley is 
imputing to Glarean an &lsquo;internal&rsquo; view of the modes, but 
nothing in Bent&rsquo;s solution changes the final or range (i.e. 
the external criteria by which the mode is recognized), 
hence Bent&rsquo;s view that her solution does not disturb &lsquo;modal 
coherence.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<p>

[17] While I do not think that I am &ldquo;mixing up&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
performance and understanding, I do see that this is 
something that needs to be addressed, and one way in which 
I hope to advance the formulations of DF is to make that 
distinction a bit clearer. I hope I have done so by 
introducing the &ldquo;default&rdquo; element into paras [4&ndash;7] above.  
Having advocated even more separation of tracks than I did 
in DF, I see that here I have not gone far enough, and  
that certain rare conundrum passages like the Josquin that 
are capable of a perfect contrapuntal realization might in 
practice not receive it. Just as there might be a reading 
of a piece that was perfectly consonant with the 
traditional (Wibberley&rsquo;s) modal-scalar ideal, but a reading that 
one would not choose in practice, so there may be passages 
like the Josquin sequence where the perfection of the 
counterpoint would have been tempered in practice. This is 
where my discussion above of a &ldquo;default&rdquo; concept may be 
helpful. While I in no way withdraw from &ldquo;my&rdquo; version of 
the Josquin as an exercise in contrapuntal perfection, I am 
perfectly prepared to accept the possibility of a more 
cautious compromise (see below), if only to direct 
attention to the premises by admitting that they need not 
stand or fall by an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; example. I chose examples 
that would make vivid the radically different conceptual 
underpinnings of old and new notation, rather than to 
illustrate the much subtler consequences that this 
understanding brings in practice for most &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pieces; 
but if we can now agree to recognise the Josquin as a 
special case, the way may be open for broader acceptance of 
what I have outlined above.
<p>

[18] In an attempt to set out the main tributaries of a 
proposed radical shift in <i>understanding</i> the basis of 
notation (not necessarily or always entailing a shift in 
the sounding <i>results</i>), I inevitably overstated or 
understated some aspects, largely by insufficiently freeing 
myself of some modern prejudices. In attempting to 
formulate the complementary nature of notation and 
counterpoint, I may have overstated the weakness of the 
default, leading others to impute a less disciplined 
relativism than I actually intend. I hope that the default 
element helps here.  I seem to have <i>under</i>stated my 
position on the role of hexachords and solmization, and 
hence misled Daniel Zager and some others about how 
mastery of solmization relates to ficta.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup>  I never meant 
to claim (as Zager implies but does not state) that 
solmization can resolve counterpoint/ficta problems. I do 
not share his dependence on solmization to determine 
counterpoint. Rather the converse: contrapuntal decisions, 
once made, can be expressed in terms of solmization, the 
nearest they had to a precise language in which to 
conceptualise and name sounds.  But since they stretched 
the system to cope with all eventualities, so that anything 
could be solmized by extensions and disjunctions, the 
criterion of easy solmization is not a valid arbiter of 
which sounds are or are not possible. To argue a particular 
solution <i>from</i> solmization is to let the tail wag the dog. 
I wrote:  &ldquo;Hexachords provide a functional context for 
semitone locations which have been predetermined by musical 
considerations, but they do not in themselves determine 
what the sounds will be. The hexachordal <i>voces</i>  are the 
means by which those sounds become practically accessible 
in vocal polyphony, just as, by analogy, fingering is the 
means by which small groups of notes are physically 
negotiated on instruments.&rdquo; Hexachordal thinking permeates 
their terminology. It guides us away from the notion of 
&ldquo;inflections&rdquo; of individual  notes and into that of small 
scalar segments (sometimes projected as tangents from the 
<i>scala</i> of <i>musica recta</i>) that accommodate and articulate 
semitones, the need for which is <i>pre-determined</i> on 
contrapuntal principles. It cannot in itself solve 
individual ficta problems just as, conversely, no ficta 
solution can be rejected on grounds that it can&rsquo;t be 
solmized. Nor, as Judd agrees, can modal theory solve ficta 
questions, whether Aaron&rsquo;s or Glarean&rsquo;s. What I have 
proposed is the beginnings of a system drawing simple rules 
and priorities from counterpoint theory, principles whose 
development, exceptions and qualifications will have to 
venture beyond the point where theory helps us and be 
derived in turn from actual composed music; but they can be 
projected homeopathically in the direction indicated by 
that theory (rather than antibiotically from our alien 
perspective), and fleshed out from a practice stripped of 
some modern varnish (such as the notion of modal fidelity 
as an arbiter of tonal stability, and of modern notation 
&ldquo;as is&rdquo;).  Some of these precepts are strong and binding. 
Some are weaker and open to alternatives and competing 
priorities. All of them can be accepted without the 
obligation to choke down my Josquin example whole as a 
prescription for <i>practice</i>. That is negotiable.
<p>

[19] Having thus slightly rearranged the furniture to 
permit (I hope) constructive discussion, now to the 
Josquin. I should add to my list of miscalculations that I 
ought to have saved that example until a later time, in 
order not to distract attention from the premises, or at 
least I should have continued the argument, which I will 
now try to do. It <i>is</i> an exceptional puzzle, and has been 
so recognized by several writers, notably by Dahlhaus, with 
the rather different conclusion that &ldquo;der Tonsatz abstrakt 
konzipiert ist und dass sich Josquin ueber die 
Unentschiedenheit, wie er zu realisieren sei, hinwegsetzte, 
da sie ihm gleichgueltig war.&rdquo; (&ldquo;the composition is conceived 
in the abstract, and that Josquin disregarded 
the inconclusiveness as to how [the composition] was to be realized, 
because he was indifferent to [the inconclusiveness.&rdquo;)  Dahlhaus thus posits 
<i>the composer&rsquo;s indifference to the actual resulting 
sounds</i>, and argues that counterpoint thus abstractly 
conceived  may have lacked either prior aural imagination 
of such sounds or, indeed, any musically acceptable 
realization<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> To this view 
Berger and I join in taking 
exception, if for different reasons.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Josquin&rsquo;s sequence 
<i>is</i> a conundrum, of a fairly rare type. In the disputed 
measures, he gives us not just one text-book sequential 
&ldquo;cliche&rdquo; chain of fifths and sixths, but <i>two</i> superimposed 
contrapuntal pairs, discant and tenor, tenor and bass<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
<i>both</i> of which, (not just the upper pair, <i>pace</i> Wibberley [13]), 
have claims to perfection <i>and</i> place constraints on the 
other. Dahlhaus gave up on the passage. Lowinsky favoured B 
natural in bar 48 because it fitted his sense of the piece 
as being <i>tonal</i> as well as (<i>nearly</i> pure) Ionian.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
Urquhart accepts <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> at bar 48, but avoids my version by 
accepting the simultaneous false relation of a B <i>natural</i> 
against it in the treble.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup>  
Wibberley also accepts the 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, but his compromise has a melodic augmented fourth <i>and</i> 
a simultaneous diminished fifth at 48&ndash;50.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> The conundrum 
is that, <i>pace</i> Dahlhaus, I have shown that Josquin wrote a 
passage that <i>is</i> capable of contrapuntally perfect 
realization, whether we like it or not, and this 
intervallic perfection has been acknowledged by Wibberley (n.7) 
and by others in the list discussion. Let us call it &ldquo;a&rdquo; 
solution but not necessarily &ldquo;the&rdquo; solution. In the context 
of DF, I was frankly more interested in its Janus-like 
status as a theoretical conundrum than in making a binding 
performance prescription. I would now prefer to call that 
version a contrapuntally-defined default, a <i>starting-
point</i> for negotiation or compromise. I was exploring the 
implications of counterpoint, not primarily fixing up a 
piece for performance&mdash;perhaps I did not make this clear 
enough (in DF n.49), but it is clearer to me now.
<p>

[20] The provocation, therefore, is not mine but 
Josquin&rsquo;s. It remains interesting and inescapable that he 
set up this sequential passage of two superimposed 
contrapuntal pairs in such a way that an intervallically 
flawless reading,<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> if not a 
perfect solution, is 
possible. Josquin&rsquo;s conceit deserves better than that we 
retreat from it on anachronistic grounds based on notions 
of white-note supremacy or modal chastity. Wibberley has attempted 
to make the case for doing so on modal grounds, but for 
reasons given by Judd, and because of the irrelevance to 
Josquin&rsquo;s personal arsenal of the later testimony of 
Glarean, let alone Zarlino, it will be clear that I do not 
think he has succeeded.  We have to choose in practice 
whether to depart from that particular kind of perfection&mdash;
indeed, whether Josquin was provoking us to do just that, 
rather than whether to depart from the notational 
translation of a modern score. That is the nub of the 
&ldquo;default&rdquo; aspect of my hypothesis.  Bach chose occasionally 
to break &ldquo;rules&rdquo; about parallels or leading notes; we must 
be prepared for Josquin to do likewise, and to imply that 
we need to realise certain passages imperfectly. But we had 
better have a reason more firmly grounded in what we can 
discern of the musical practice of Josquin&rsquo;s contemporaries 
than simply disliking something that differs from what <i>we</i> 
have&mdash;perhaps mistakenly&mdash;grown used to. Addled by years 
of hearing and seeing under-inflected performances (of the 
notation &ldquo;as it stands&rdquo;) with too many flat leading-notes 
and proto-tonal diminished fifths, our mistrained ears are 
not reliable arbiters. That &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t tried it because we 
don&rsquo;t like it&rdquo; (to quote the old Guinness advertisement) is 
a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<p>

[21] I am pleased to see that there has come to be 
acceptance of the bass <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in bar 48 by Wibberley and Urquhart, despite 
other disagreements.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> This 
note was ubiquitously 
rendered as B natural in the Josquin <i>Werken</i>, in Miller&rsquo;s 
edition of Glareanus, by Lowinsky, and in most recorded 
performances. Good, for that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> seems to me the one non-
negotiable point, and reflects new acceptance of a strong 
priority that we can perhaps all agree on. The B natural 
was earlier seen as a kind of first-inversion dominant 
seventh anticipating the leading-note that takes us back to 
the bright radiance of C major or, if you prefer, Glarean&rsquo;s 
likewise anachronistic hypoionian.  The  <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in bar 48 
<i>both</i> avoids a linear tritone <i>and</i> a simultaneous 
diminished 5th in a standard sequential progression, and 
thus claims priority on two counts. But that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is the thin 
end of a wedge; that there <i>can</i> be an ideal solution but 
no perfect solution makes it very difficult to define how 
far is too far, now that we have removed anachronistic 
tonal harmony, simplistic modal restraints, and, I hope, 
the misapplication of modern notation as defaults.
<p>

[22] Except for the bar 48 <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, alternative compromise 
solutions can be entertained in performance, including the 
different ones of Wibberley and Urquhart (and see DF n.49). Since there 
is no good solution, the actual performance choice is much 
less interesting, because to some extent arbitrary. I have 
summarized the most important rules and priorities,(see 
above, n.5) but there are many caveats, and a much longer 
discussion is necessary, especially of the circumstances 
where diminished fifths may be permitted, and where there 
is some common ground between my views and those of Berger and 
Urquhart. I could, for example, more readily tolerate an&mdash;albeit 
unnecessary, and denied by a notated B flat&mdash;diminished 
5th in the different context of bar 43 (with B* natural 
below F contracting to a third on C and E between the lower 
parts) before Wibberley&rsquo;s example begins: <p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>[discantus]</td>
		<td>D</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>B</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[tenor]</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>E</td>
		<td>D</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[bassus]</td>
		<td>D B*</td>
		<td>C</td>
		<td>G</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
The fifth at bar 48 on the other hand does not contract but 
forms part of an ongoing sequence and must, as we seem to 
agree, be perfect. But how do the following limbs of the 
sequence differ in the constraints that are placed on 
consonance and contrapuntal perfection? Wibberley cites Aaron in 
support of his claim [15] that &ldquo;None of this means, 
however, that diminished fifths were to be completely 
banned from composed music; it simply means that perfect 
consonances did not admit them, and that where perfect 
consonances were <i>to be attained</i> [my emphasis] such 
intervals had to be eliminated.&rdquo; If <i>this</i> chain of fifths 
is not a prime, and literally text-book, candidate for 
&ldquo;where perfect consonances were to be attained,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t 
know what is. Having accepted the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in 48 by the rules of 
consonance [4], his version presents both a linear tritone 
and a simultaneous diminished 5th in a standard sequential 
progression, and thus merely pushes further on the crisis 
that was avoided at bar 48. He invokes a lower status for 
the relationship between the upper parts, which might be 
acceptable when the main contrapuntal relationship was 
between the lower two. Indeed, diminished fifths sometimes 
occur either, as Wibberley puts it, between upper parts that are 
supported from below, or, as I would more often prefer to 
put it, when the primary contrapuntal cadence, the 6th to 
8ve between the lower parts, has an added part above, e.g.:<p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>[discantus]</td>
		<td>F</td>
		<td>E</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[2nd discantus]</td>
		<td>B</td>
		<td>C</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[tenor]</td>
		<td>D</td>
		<td>C</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
But he fails to recognise that the Josquin passage does not 
meet those criteria, because its unique feature is that 
<i>two</i> primary and non-cadential contrapuntal progressions 
are superimposed, and that the upper part therefore cannot 
be treated as subsidiary.
<p>

[23] In light of Judd&rsquo;s postings to mto-talk it is almost
superfluous for me at this point to deny the relevance of
Glarean&rsquo;s twelve-mode system (or for that matter Zarlino&rsquo;s
counterpoint theory<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>) to 
discussion of constraints and freedoms
that might have applied in Josquin&rsquo;s mind and his expectations of
performance.  Glareanus says nothing relevant to counterpoint and
ficta.  His 12-mode system is no more germane to how <i>Josquin</i>
might have classified the <i>Ave Maria</i> than would be a roman
numeral analysis to his harmony.  Wibberley would be mistaken to
assume that my silence on Glareanus was for any other reason (see
DF 45).  Judd published a modally-based analysis of the motet,
not mentioned by Wibberley;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
in principle, her and my
statements can co-exist without disagreements affecting our
different approaches:  &ldquo;there is simply no need for mode or ficta
to impinge one upon the other because they occupy different
conceptual and theoretical realms&rdquo;(&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO 2.5,&rdquo; <a href="http://societymusictheory.org/www-talk/mto/96july.mto/0032.html">mto-talk
23 July 1996</a>).<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Judd 
further commented in the same posting:
&ldquo;Wibberley&rsquo;s straightforward mapping from composer to theorist
(and vice versa) highlights an even more problematic issue.  I
find his view of theorists as &rdquo;witnesses&ldquo; difficult to sustain.
Aron, Glarean, and Zarlino are, after all, advocates of their own
agendas as well as witnesses.&rdquo;  Then Wibberley (&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO
2.5,&rdquo;<a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0004.html"> mto-talk 19 August 1996</a>):  
&ldquo;The presumption underlying my
article was that the Josquin motet WAS [Ionian tonality],
especially since Glareanus said so.&rdquo;  and (&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO 2.5,&rdquo;
<a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0000.html">mto-talk 5 August 1996</a>):  &ldquo;What 
is clear to me is that Glareanus
is telling us something quite definitely about the way the
COMPOSER has composed the music, rather than about the way others
might have performed it.&rdquo;  Does Wibberley not distinguish between
subsequent comment and classification on the one hand, and what
could have been in the composer&rsquo;s mind, on the other?  It is
indeed a big leap to go from a subsequent theorist (especially
Glarean) with his own axe to grind to make the assumption that
because this was in his mind it must have been in Josquin&rsquo;s more
than 50 years earlier.
<p>

[24] Finally, some further comments and questions for Wibberley.
Why is it acceptable for <i>Absalom</i> to &ldquo;modulate&rdquo; (a modern 
term and concept) and, as Wibberley would have it, to &ldquo;remove the 
harmony from its base,&rdquo; but not (by his standards) for the 
Josquin or indeed the Obrecht? By what standards does he 
judge such &ldquo;removal&rdquo; not only permissible but &ldquo;very 
successful&rdquo; while other comparable pieces are not similarly 
favoured?<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>  Indeed, we cannot 
be sure exactly what 
Glareanus means by his &ldquo;without removing the harmony from 
its base,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> invoked by 
Wibberley against excessive fictive 
adjustments. Glarean&rsquo;s language and context <i>may</i> suggest 
some connection with Aaron&rsquo;s <i>distonata via</i> and 
Tinctoris&rsquo;s <i>distonatio</i>, neither of which easily lends 
itself to the construction Wibberley would wish to place on it. 
This is a difficult area, yet to be explained; Wibberley jumps too 
readily to the conclusion that it must mean removal from 
defaults of modern, not of renaissance, imposition.
<p>

[25] That Wibberley accepts <i>some</i> &ldquo;ficta additions&rdquo; (I would
prefer to call them contrapuntal adjustments) is clear in his
posting of 8 August (&ldquo;Wibberley, MTO 2.5&rdquo; <a href="http:/www-talk/mto/96aug.mto/0002.html">mto-talk 8 August 1996</a>).
Are all of these consonant with his view of mode in pieces
classified by Glareanus (or indeed Aaron), or with the way that
these theorists <i>would have</i> classified them?  Up to what point
does he accept &ldquo;inflections,&rdquo; and which ones, on what criteria
and authority, and why no further?  How does he reconcile the
constraint he draws from Glareanus with explicit and
incontrovertible text-book examples of ficta from the early 16th
century, such as offered by Ornithoparcus and Listenius?<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Are
works classified by Glareanus to be given different treatment in
order that they can conform with Wibberley&rsquo;s sense of what
Glarean means, irrespective of any musical characteristics that
may suggest otherwise?  He also accepts ([13]) that my example is
consonant.  He sometimes invokes the rules of consonance, though
he does not make it clear where he departs from the
notational-contrapuntal premises of DF&mdash;where indeed?  It is on
(albeit anachronistic) modal grounds that he determines that the
rules of consonance may here be broken.  Wibberley adopts the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>in the bass at bar 48 &ldquo;by the accepted rules of consonance,&rdquo; but
it was not widely accepted before I spelled out those rules (see
above, n.5).  Wibberley and others think that my Josquin example
takes the application of the rules too far for practical
purposes, and I might even agree with them, but they (and I) have
yet to define precisely at what point and why the &ldquo;accepted rules
of consonance&rdquo; become unacceptable.  Does Wibberley have a view
on this?
<p>

[26] Wibberley [21] and n.11 is unclear about the status of the 
fourth. When the fourth appears in composition treated 
<i>not</i> as a dissonance, it is because it is not part of the 
primary contrapuntal pair. In this case there will be a 
<p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3">fifth or a third below it:</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[discant]</td>     
		<td><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr></td>
		<td>G</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[contratenor]</td>
		<td><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr></td>
		<td>D</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[tenor]</td>
		<td>A</td>
		<td>G</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Another and more medieval way of explaining this would be 
that <i>each</i> of the upper parts formed a contrapuntal pair, 
cadencing on a 5th and 8ve respectively, with the lowest 
part, when that part is functionally the tenor at that 
moment. When the fourth occurs between the primary dyadic 
pair&mdash;that is what Tinctoris means by &ldquo;in counterpoint&rdquo;&mdash;
it must be treated as a dissonance, i.e prepared and 
resolved.   Wibberley&rsquo;s citation of Tinctoris&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hence it is 
rejected [as a consonance] by counterpoint&rdquo; (n.11) means 
just that. He misinterprets Tinctoris&rsquo;s statement as 
meaning generally in the musical texture, but counterpoint 
clearly must be understood specifically here, or it doesn&rsquo;t 
make sense, and Wibberley has to labour to do so. He confuses the 
issue by bringing in acoustics ([15] and n.15). Acoustic 
perfection is on a separate track (again!) from 
contrapuntal perfection. Later instructions for the 
behaviour of a third or fourth voice are also ancillary to 
the primary dyadic counterpoint.
<p>

[27] A substantial portion of Wibberley&rsquo;s article [paras. 14&ndash;19] 
is devoted to the examples in Aaron&rsquo;s <i>Aggiunta</i> to his 
<i>Toscanello</i>. I have discussed these examples and 
rules,<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> and invite interested 
readers to compare my 
explanations with Wibberley&rsquo;s for some of the features he 
observes. He fails to point out [14] that Aaron&rsquo;s 
discussion of partial signatures relates them to mode; see 
ACN p. 321. See ACN p. 324 for a discussion of Aaron&rsquo;s bias 
to the lowest voice. In para 18 Wibberley raises Orto&rsquo;s <i>Ave 
Maria</i>, used as an example in Aaron&rsquo;s <i>Aggiunta</i>, and says 
that the only reason for the diminished 5th in the 
preceding bar is that there is a G in the bass beneath it.  
Not so. The <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> above E contracts to a third, but this E is 
making a discant-tenor 6&ndash;8 cadence with the bass. This is 
one case for possible exemption for diminished fifths (see 
[22] above). Indeed, a fifth contracting to a third might 
sometimes be regarded as &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; when it is not part of 
the primary discant-tenor contrapuntal relationship, and it 
does not always have to have bass support.  Aaron&rsquo;s 
weighing of priorities in the Agnus of Josquin&rsquo;s Missa 
<i>L&rsquo;homme arme super voces musicales</i> is discussed in DF 26-
28 and ACN p. 312; he allows a mediated melodic augmented 
fourth (but not in a sequence) in order to avoid a 
simultaneous diminished fifth, <i>and</i> to concord with the 
cantus firmus. The melodic augmented fourth is here 
mediated, and is tolerated in the interests of perfecting a 
simultaneous fifth; Wibberley&rsquo;s solution achieves neither.
<p>

[28] No one these days can deny the importance of language, 
and the way the terms we use permeate our thought-processes 
and prejudices. Thus it is surely also important, for our 
purposes, to flag dangerous short-circuits or short cuts 
that may symptomise inappropriate matching of concepts and 
terms, so that, when we have to use modern terms, we can at 
least be aware that the <i>absence</i> of an early term may be 
eloquent.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> I pointed out at the 
beginining of DF that 
medieval theory had no single word for pitch or for rhythm, 
but rather <i>congeries</i> of differently-shaded words, a 
powerful symptom of the separate tracks on which, for 
example, mode, counterpoint, solmization and tuning 
operate. These tracks are interdependent, but not in the 
way we imagine when we prioritize not only pitch, but a 
frequency-biased notion of pitch.
<p>

[29] In conclusion:<br>
There is still a widespread and under-supported belief that 
renaissance composers must have stuck largely to &ldquo;white-
note diatonicism&rdquo; except where we are forced to believe 
otherwise. This has been supported from modern misprisions 
of mode (such as Wibberley&rsquo;s), now being unpicked, that were in 
turn introduced to counter what we now see as the 
excessively harmonic-tonal approaches to early music by 
previous generations of scholars. The unpicking of all 
related assumptions still has a long way to go. Recent 
repudiation of artificial shackles of &ldquo;modal purity&rdquo; (or 
whatever we call it) invites us to start afresh with open 
minds about the sound of early vocal polyphony. (The 
question of tuning is separable, but obviously important, 
since it is loaded with many of the same modern 
assumptions. The contrapuntal arguments are not affected by 
precisely what tuning system they are realized in, but can 
be made on their own track.) The urgent question remains: 
if Judd&rsquo;s view that &ldquo;modal fidelity&rdquo; poses no constraints on 
ficta prevails over Wibberley&rsquo;s view that it does, i.e. if it is 
true that &ldquo;paper&rdquo; modal assignations may be disconnected 
from realized sounds; and if my premises outlined  above 
find even partial acceptance, are we not further overlaying 
modern prejudices on early music by assuming that in order 
to be &ldquo;coherent&rdquo; it must conform to <i>our</i> standards of 
long-range tonality (and frequency)? Some of the same 
questions arising from our imposition of value-laden terms 
have been raised by Richard Taruskin and others for 
&ldquo;authenticity,&rdquo; a term of approbation which admits no 
alternative; I believe we must do the same for &ldquo;stability&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;coherence.&rdquo;</p>

an elimination being her prime motive).&rdquo; I invite him to 
re-read the way I set up the Josquin example. If any

separately. But the altus may yet be the best way into 
arguments as to how one might depart from a contrapuntally 
pure default.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">See DF n.48, where I comment on the source status of 
the bass B flat. Wibberley however places it in parentheses in 
&ldquo;my&rdquo; version, while stating:  &ldquo;By the accepted rules of 
consonance, the bass b must be flattened to b-flat in order 
to provide a perfect consonance with the tenor&rdquo; (Wibberley [4]).</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">Wibberley [29] &ldquo;Josquin would seem, in the example under
