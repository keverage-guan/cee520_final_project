<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] In most accounts of musical subjectivity, much depends 
upon the workings of musical syntax, the linear trajectory through which a subject 
is drawn as a piece of music unfolds. In this paper I am interested in what happens 
when this type of linear trajectory is absent. More specifically, I am wondering 
what kinds of subjectivities are possible when musical syntax is undermined by obstinate 
motivic repetition. Repetition can potentially serve a great variety of expressive 
purposes: the transcendent mysticism of John Adams&rsquo; <i>Shaker Loops</i>, the prison-house 
effect of Frederic Rzewski&rsquo;s <i>Coming Together</i>, and the cool indifferent mechanics 
of Michael Nyman&rsquo;s <i>Musique a grande vitesse</i> all rely upon the monolithic 
technique of incessant motivic repetition. How are such varied expressive effects 
achieved when musical syntax plays such a limited role?</p>
<p>[2] To begin to address these questions, I will first consider some recent accounts 
of musical subjectivity and the role that syntax plays in these models. Much of 
the work of the late Naomi Cumming deals with what she calls &ldquo;the musical subject.&rdquo; 
In her published analyses of Steve Reich&rsquo;s <i>Different Trains</i> and of J. S. 
Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Erbarme Dich&rdquo; from the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i>, Cumming focuses upon 
the ways in which these works construct musical personae that serve as figures of 
identification for the listener.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> As she describes it, this &ldquo;musical subject&rdquo; is what listeners <i>become</i> while 
they are engaged with a piece of music.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 1</b>. Parameters that construct the &ldquo;musical subject&rdquo;</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="leydon_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 1 thumbnail" src="leydon_fig1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[3] Cumming argues that the sense of this musical subject emerges from the interaction 
of three parameters, as summarized in
<b>Figure 1</b>. The first is <i>timbre</i>, 
which involves the listener in a kind of vicarious vocality: the human voice serves 
as an interpretant for the grain of the musical sound (as in the &ldquo;plaintive&rdquo; tone 
of an oboe, &ldquo;screaming&rdquo; guitars, or &ldquo;muffled&rdquo; horns). The second is <i>gesture</i>, 
through which a listener gains access to a vicarious kinesthesia: physical gestures 
of the body serve as interpretants for motivic shapes, rhythms and contours (as 
in a &ldquo;soaring&rdquo; melody, &ldquo;creeping chromaticism&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;power chord&rdquo;). Third, <i>syntax</i> 
can serve as the locus of causality and intentionality: the elements in music which 
create implicative expectancies­­voice-leading, harmonic progressions, conventionalized 
forms and generative grammars­­these elements draw us through a linear trajectory 
that can be understood as &ldquo;causal&rdquo; in some sense. </p>
<p>[4] Drawing on David Lidov&rsquo;s ideas on &ldquo;Mind and body in music,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Cumming links the &ldquo;bodily&rdquo; subject primarily with the domains of timbre and gesture, 
while the domain of syntax is more closely connected with &ldquo;the will&rdquo; or the <i>volitional 
agency</i> of the musical subject. It is the three parameters of timbre, gesture, 
and syntax, taken together, which produce the sense of the &ldquo;whole&rdquo; subject.</p>
<p>[5] So the musical subject <i>speaks</i>, <i>moves</i>, and <i>intends</i>. But 
what happens when the sense of musical cause and effect is attenuated or abandoned 
altogether? What happens to &ldquo;the musical subject&rdquo; when syntax is undermined by the 
obstinate repetition of a single motivic gesture? What domains of subjective experience 
can we map onto the &ldquo;absence of volition&rdquo; that this musical situation implies?
</p>
<p>[6] The kinds of repetition that I have in mind include ostinati and minimalist 
techniques. These techniques are frequently described in terms of their effect of 
&ldquo;stasis,&rdquo; and interpretation often links them with an outright <i>loss</i> of subjectivity. 
But in musical practice, repetition techniques clearly serve a much wider variety 
of affective purposes. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 2</b>. Middleton&rsquo;s &ldquo;repetition strategies&rdquo;</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="leydon_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 2 thumbnail" src="leydon_fig2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[7] One explanation for this variation of affect is the fact that ostinati come 
in a variety of shapes and sizes. Richard Middleton offers a useful way to distinguish 
among different kinds of ostinati and their effects.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Middleton draws a distinction between what he calls &ldquo;discursive&rdquo; and &ldquo;musematic&rdquo; 
repetition strategies. <b>Figure 2</b> 
summarizes this model. Musematic repetition is a more or less unvaried repetition 
of &ldquo;musemes&rdquo;&mdash;of motivic quanta, the smallest meaningful units within a musical 
system. Discursive repetition, on the other hand, is repetition of longer, syntactically 
more complex units, like whole phrases or strophes. The musematic strategy tends 
to project a single-leveled formal structure­­a &ldquo;groove,&rdquo; while the discursive strategy 
projects a hierarchically organized discourse&mdash;as in &ldquo;strophic form&rdquo;, for instance. 
The two strategies are differently weighted in different musical styles and they 
produce quite different experiential effects. Middleton conceives of these repetition 
strategies as two extremes on a continuum, with intermediate types lying somewhere 
in between. At the bottom of Figure 2 I show some examples of repetition categories 
and their relative positions on the continuum.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 3</b>. Three accounts of the signifying potential of musical syntax</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="leydon_examples.php?id=2&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 3 thumbnail" src="leydon_fig3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[8] Middleton argues that a purely musematic strategy will achieve a kind of 
&ldquo;psychic resonance&rdquo; for listeners, while discursive strategies will require more 
of an &ldquo;<i>investment</i></i> of energy&rdquo; <i>from</i> listeners. His account of discursive 
structures as &ldquo;requiring energy&rdquo; intersects with Cumming&rsquo;s account of syntax as 
the site of intentionality. In other words, both authors connect the feeling of 
&ldquo;willful effort&rdquo; with the aspects of music that project <i>hierarchy</i>.
<b>Figure 3</b> compares the accounts 
of syntax we find in Middleton and Cumming. These distinctions between gesture and 
syntax, between the musematic and the discursive, resonate with Leonard Meyer&rsquo;s 
distinction between music&rsquo;s statistical and syntactical aspects. For Meyer, statistical 
or &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; parameters primarily involve physio-motor response while the syntactical 
parameters involve cognition.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>[9] I draw on the work of these scholars to reinforce the notion that a palpable 
sense of volition in a musical work has something to do with our awareness of hierarchies 
in the music. This suggests that, depending upon whether an ostinato is more &ldquo;discursively&rdquo; 
or more &ldquo;musematically&rdquo; oriented, repetition can tell very different kinds of stories 
about the musical subject. The internal structure of an ostinato itself, as well 
as its interaction with other lines or other ostinati, can suggest a subject with 
particular kinds of volitional attributes. </p>
<p>[10] Examples 1, 2, and 3 illustrate the qualitative distinction between musematic 
and discursive strategies. As you listen to these excerpts, consider what sort of 
musical subject emerges in each case&mdash;what sort of character does one &ldquo;become&rdquo;? 
And to what extent does the internal structure of the ostinato suggest attributes 
of that subject&mdash;not only the way it speaks and moves, but also the way it <i>intends</i> 
to speak and move. </p>

<p>[11] <b>Example 1</b> is a selection from 
Raymond Scott&rsquo;s <i>Soothing Sounds for Baby</i>, a set of three albums of electronic 
music, released in 1964 under the auspices of the Gesell Institute for Childhood 
Development. The music is expressly intended for the listening pleasure of babies 
up to 18 months of age. Many grownups, however, enjoy these records too, perhaps 
because of their success in evoking an imagined oceanic state of contentment. The 
texture juxtaposes a purely musematic layer with a second, more discursively-conceived 
melody. The musical subject here might be understood as contained within a kind 
of safe holding environment, or in what David Schwarz has called &ldquo;the sonorous envelope.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> As our attention shifts back and forth between the strictly musematic repetitions 
(shown in the example on the lower pair of staves) and discursive ones (represented 
by the top staff in the example), a dynamic interplay is setup in which agency is 
tentatively explored and then relinquished. We can imagine a musical subject which 
gently fluctuates between states of musematic &ldquo;being&rdquo; and discursive &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>[12] Now consider <b>Example 2</b>. This 
is a bit of Drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bass music by Spring Heel Jack, an excerpt from &ldquo;Bells&rdquo; from 
the album <i>Busy, Curious, Thirsty</i> from 1996. Interlocking layers in the texture 
present a graduated series of repetition strategies, from short, musematic &ldquo;riffs&rdquo; 
(such as the bass line) to longer, more discursively-structured units (such as the 
long descending chromatic line that emerges in the highest voice towards the end 
of the excerpt). Compared with Example 1, the musical subject here is a much more 
kinesthetically competent one, and one with a greater degree of volitional confidence. 
The differentiated periodicities of the layers in the hierarchical structure forge 
a palpable connection between the underlying volitional effort of the subject and 
its intricate gestures and movements. </p>
<p>[13] When differentiated ostinati are layered up in very dense textures, repetition 
techniques can suggest musical subjectivities of greater complexity. Consider, for 
instance, <b>Example 3</b>, a passage from Arvo 
Pärt&rsquo;s <i>Arbos</i>. Example 3 configures a musical subject that contrasts with 
both the &ldquo;infant&rdquo; and the &ldquo;dancer&rdquo; in Examples 1 and 2. It might be described as 
more &ldquo;contemplative.&rdquo; For one thing, the ostinato phrase (marked with a beam in 
the example) is more expansive and more syntactically complex than what we find 
in Examples 1 and 2. In fact, the phrase marked here emerges from an additive process 
that occurs prior to the beginning of the excerpt. Moreover, these repeated phrases 
are embedded within the structure of a mensuration canon: units at the surface are 
generated from a slow-moving cantus firmus in the background. The title of the work,
<i>Arbos</i>, suggests that the work attempts to create a musical analog for the 
structure of a tree. In fact Pärt claims to be representing something even more 
specific: a <i>family</i> tree. The remote lower layers of the texture are intended 
to represent familial ancestors to the generations propagating at the foreground. 
Pärt&rsquo;s structure, then, suggests a whole constellation of musical personae: the 
more salient, faster-moving foreground figures suggest one kind of musical&mdash;a 
present, active, live subject (or perhaps several subjects)&mdash;while background structures 
suggest the ghostly presence of musical &ldquo;others&rdquo; in the work.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>[14] The creation of internal contrasts between musematic and discursive structures 
is one way that repetitive music can forge particular subjective identities. If 
the degree of &ldquo;volitional will&rdquo; of the musical subject is correlated with the sense 
of hierarchical organization, then the features of a particular hierarchy, such 
as its depth or granularity, will afford and constrain the musical subject&rsquo;s identity 
in particular ways. Music that confounds hierarchic listening altogether because 
of a preponderance of undifferentiated &ldquo;riffs&rdquo; may suggest a &ldquo;will-less&rdquo; or &ldquo;automatized&rdquo; 
subject. Hierarchies that are shallow, with few levels, may suggest a tentative 
volitional state. In more highly stratified textures with differentiated levels 
of musematic and discursive parsing, the subject may be understood as more &ldquo;willful,&rdquo; 
provided the strata are perceived as hierarchically interlocked. Particularly deep 
or complex hierarchies or situations in which metrical relationships between figure 
and ground are ambiguous may suggest a split subject or a plurality of willful subjects.

<p>[15] Because ostinati may be constructed and combined in myriad ways, a variety 
of different kinds of stories can be told about musical subjects. Some of these 
stories are represented in <b>Figure 
4</b>, a list of six &ldquo;tropes,&rdquo; along with some representative pieces, all of which 
employ the device of obstinate repetition. Naturally, the titles and other textual 
elements play an important role in determining the type of subject in each of these 
representative works, but I am speculating that the different personae associated 
with these tropes are created at least in part by structural relationships that 
obtain between surface and syntax in each musical situation. </p>
<p>[16] Musical examples 1, 2, and 3 appear on Figure 4 as representative works 
in the MATERNAL, the KINETIC, and the MANTRIC categories, respectively. The MANTRIC 
trope is designated as such because in these works the museme acts as a kind of 
mantra, whose endless repetition suggests access to mystical or spiritual transcendence. 
Several features work to make Pärt&rsquo;s <i>Arbos</i> mantra-like: certainly the overriding 
harmonic consonance and the limited  pitch resources of a single diatonic mode 
evoke a serene and contemplative state. But the mode of repetition itself and the 
measured transformation of musemes into discursive units are key aspects of the 
mantric effect. Furthermore, the tangible proportional relations that obtain among 
of the various layers represent the kind of complex hierarchical organization that 
suggests a multiplicity of mutually interdependent subjects&mdash;or a subject &ldquo;in tune 
with the universe,&rdquo; as it were.</p>

<p>[17] In the TOTALITARIAN trope, on the other hand, musematic repetition suggests 
a kind of &ldquo;prison house&rdquo; effect, an inability for the musical subject to break free 
of an obstinate musematic strategy. Here I am including works like Louis Andriessen&rsquo;s
<i>De Staat</i>, which sets Plato&rsquo;s famous prohibitions against music-making. Frederic 
Rzewski&rsquo;s <i>Coming Together</i>, inspired by the Attica prison riots, is another 
example, and since this work employs a number of techniques similar to those found 
in Pärt&rsquo;s <i>Arbos</i> it is instructive to compare the two. Like Pärt&rsquo;s <i>Arbos</i>, 
Rzewski&rsquo;s piece adheres to a consistent diatonic mode throughout (G minor pentatonic) 
and employs additive processes. Despite these similarities, however, <i>Coming Together</i> 
manages to suggest a very different kind of musical subject. Aside from the explicit 
information conveyed by the text (a recitation of Sam Melville&rsquo;s ominous letter), 
the mode of repetition itself expresses a kind of frustrated subject or suppressed 
volitional agency. As <b>Example 4</b> shows, the gradual lengthening 
of the primary melodic pattern by a single note with each repetition initially suggests 
the potential for <i>overcoming</i> the obstinate musematic strategy. A 
short way into the piece, however, a subtractive process takes over, in which the pattern loses 
its starting note with each repetition. These processes, then, produce no eventual 
linear diegesis but only additional musemes. <i>Coming Together</i> by turns anticipates 
and retreats from discursive possibilities. The persistent musematic state is accentuated 
by the undifferentiated 16th-note tactus (unlike Pärt&rsquo;s lilting iambs) which foils 
hierarchic parsing.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[18] <i>Coming Together</i> thus draws upon some aspects of a fifth trope, the 
MOTORIC, where musematic strategies evoke an &ldquo;indifferent&rdquo; mechanized process. This 
situation arises most obviously in works where repetition is actually mechanical: 
think of Reich&rsquo;s <i>Pendulum Music</i> (where suspended microphones swing rhythmically 
across upturned speakers to create repetitive feedback patterns) or Ligeti&rsquo;s <i>
Poeme Symphonique</i> (for 100 metronomes). A lack of telos is cultivated by composers 
in works that attempt to portray machines in motion&mdash;like Reich&rsquo;s train music, 
or Michael Nyman&rsquo;s <i>Musique a grande vitesse</i>. By relying exclusively on the 
kinds of tensional sets that Leonard Meyer describes as &ldquo;statistical&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;syntactical,&rdquo; 
these composers succeed in evoking a mechanized or &ldquo;automatized&rdquo; subject lacking 
the kind of subjective agency normally attributed to animate beings. Musematic repetition 
here implies a kind of single-step direct-access retrieval of previously stated 
musemes. </p>
<p>[19] What distinguishes the tropes described thus far is that each configures 
a different sort of musical subject&mdash;an infant, a dancer, a mystic, a prisoner, 
a machine&mdash;as the device of repetition takes on a unique subjective meaning in each 
case. Equally important, however, is that each trope also constructs a unique meaning 
for &ldquo;syntax&rdquo;&mdash;as <i>repetition&rsquo;s opposite</i>. In the next part of this paper I 
would like to focus on the interesting case of what I call the APHASIC trope, where 
musematic repetition suggests a cognitively impaired musical subject. In these musical 
examples I am especially interested in how syntax, by its marked <i>absence</i>, 
takes on a special meaning and plays a role in expressing the character of the musical 
subject. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
	<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Example 5</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em;"><audio preload="metadata" controls style="width:300px"><source src="leydon_ex5_56.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="leydon_ex5_56.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script></audio></p></div>

<p>[20] Consider how an imagined normative syntax plays a role in
<b>Example 5</b> (audio only), part of John Oswald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pocket,&rdquo; 
from his <i>Plunderphonics</i> collection of 1989. Because the source work here&mdash;Count 
Basie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corner Pocket&rdquo;&mdash;is (probably) known by a listener in advance, the effect 
of the obstinate repetition here is of a formerly cohesive <i>Gestalt</i> that has 
been damaged or shattered. The musematic repetition is understood to be in dialogue 
with some normative syntax, which remains present in the music like a kind of &ldquo;phantom 
limb.&rdquo; When discursive structures &ldquo;deteriorate&rdquo; into musematic ones like this, repetition 
can be linked with an image of cognitive dysfunction. </p>

<p>[21] In Michael Nyman&rsquo;s opera <i>The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat</i>&mdash;based 
on the famous case study by Oliver Sachs&mdash;a similar process is employed to portray 
the main character in the opera: Dr. P, a singer, is the victim of a peculiar neurological 
condition which causes him to perceive visual information only in terms of primitive 
spatial schematics. In the second act of the opera, P&rsquo;s aphasia is musically depicted 
in a particularly effective passage wherein the phrases of Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ich Grolle 
Nicht&rdquo; from <i>Dichterliebe</i> are broken down into component musemes. This follows 
an earlier scene in Act II, where Drs. S and P perform the original Schumann song 
in its entirety. <b>Example 6a</b> shows the beginning of the Schumann song, and <b>Example 6b</b> illustrates how the 
passage is subsequently recomposed in the opera. </p>

<p>[22] Elsewhere in the opera, Nyman makes reference to other works of Schumann: 
the passage shown in <b>Example 7b</b>, accompanies a scene, &ldquo;The 
Dressing Ritual,&rdquo; in which P puts on his clothes, which have been carefully arranged 
in an ordered sequence by his wife. He does this while humming a musematicized version 
of another Schumann song, &ldquo;Rätsel,&rdquo; shown in <b>Example 7a</b>. </p>

<p>[23] The story does not concern Dr. Sach&rsquo;s attempt at a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; per se for Dr. 
P&rsquo;s condition, but rather his effort to come to grips with the way Dr. P experiences 
the world. As the neurologist gradually gropes his way through the bizarre terrain 
that is P&rsquo;s radically schematic aphasia, the musical subject, likewise, gradually 
comes to learn what it is like to <i>be</i> Dr. P. Throughout the piece, a process 
in which discursive patterns deteriorate into musemes is applied again and again, 
not only to intertextural sources but to newly composed music as well, such as the 
main melodic theme of the Prologue. As the opera progresses, motivic elements become 
unglued from their discursive context and take on a life of their own as repeated 
musemes. </p>
<p>[24] Through this process Nyman creates a unique meaning not only for the technique 
of repetition itself, but also for <i>syntax</i>. While repetition represents the 
condition of aphasia, syntax acquires the status of something like &ldquo;normal cognitive 
acuity.&rdquo; In the other tropes listed in
Figure 4, syntax takes on other 
sorts of meanings: if repetition is &ldquo;infantile&rdquo; in the MATERNAL trope, then syntax 
comes to represent something like &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;; when repetition signifies a frustrated 
or suppressed volitional agency, as in the TOTALITARIAN trope, then syntax is associated 
with &ldquo;freedom.&rdquo; This suggests that a linear diegesis&mdash;a musical process of cause 
and effect&mdash;cannot by itself be ascribed any stable or monolithic identity outside 
of a particular musical context. The signifying potential of both &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; and &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; 
are interdependently determined within a work. </p>
<p>[25] These examples, I hope, illustrate the point that techniques of obstinate 
repetition can achieve many different expressive ends. Each of these &ldquo;tropes&rdquo; configures 
the musical subject in a distinct way, by constructing different relationships between 
surface and syntax, between &ldquo;discourse&rdquo; and &ldquo;musematicity.&rdquo; If we are to understand 
something of the affective range exhibited by repetitive music, then our analyses 
must find ways to highlight the subtle interplay of these repetition strategies 
within works. As I have suggested in this preliminary study, one such analytical 
strategy would pay attention to the relative duration and complexity of repeated 
segments, the relationships among strata, the range of differentiation among musematic 
and discursive parsing within a piece, and the expressive nature of the vacuum that 
absent syntactical processes leave behind. Future research along these lines might 
specify precise criteria for the depth and granularity of hierarchic structures 
involving ostinati and determine the correlations between particular kinds of hierarchies 
and specific subjective and affective states. </p>
