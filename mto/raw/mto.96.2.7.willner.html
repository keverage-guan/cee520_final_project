<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1]  In a famous letter to his father concerning 
the premiere of the fortepiano concertos, K. 413, 414, and 415, Wolfgang 
Amadeus Mozart wrote:<p>
<blockquote>

These concertos are a happy medium between what is
too easy and too difficult; they are very brilliant,
pleasing to the ear, and natural, without being vapid. 
There are passages here and there from which the
connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction; but these
passages are written in such a way that the less learned
cannot fail to be pleased, though without knowing
why.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>

Mozart evidently had a wide range of listeners in mind, from the
musically trained connoisseur and amateur to the music lover who could
neither conceptualize nor verbalize the attractions of a piece.
Implicit in Mozart&rsquo;s remark, &ldquo;the less learned cannot fail to be
pleased, though without knowing why,&rdquo; is Mozart&rsquo;s confidence in the
appeal to the listener of the special elements in each piece; Mozart&rsquo;s 
<i>modus operandi</i> is to interweave the remarkable with the more
explicitly mundane, and to work out the tensions between them in the
course of the piece.   A look at the listener&rsquo;s 
and the scholar&rsquo;s response to such tensions&mdash;<i>oppositions</i> between <i>marked</i> and
<i>unmarked</i> compositional resources, as Robert Hatten calls them in 
his book, <i>Musical Meaning in Beethoven</i><sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup>&mdash;is the focus of my reply to
David Schulenberg&rsquo;s response (<i>Music Theory Online</i> 2.5 [1996]) to 
my article, &ldquo;More on Handel and the Hemiola: Overlapping Hemiolas&rdquo; 
(<i>Music Theory Online</i> 2.3 [1996]).<p>

[2] Referring to my analytical remarks concerning the hemiolas in the
Sarabande from Handel&rsquo;s Suite in G minor, HWV 432, Schulenberg
expresses his unease at my &ldquo;avoiding questions about the work&rsquo;s
historical context and its relationships to other works of a similar
type&rdquo; (paragraph 1); because I did not relate topical features of the
G-minor Sarabande, such as its conspicuously accented second beats, to
those found in other early eighteenth century sarabandes in general
and to other Handelian sarabandes in particular, I approached the G-minor Sarabande as a fixed object, assigning unwarranted significance
to&mdash;and perhaps misinterpreting&mdash;several passages which I felt were
decidedly hemiolic (paragraphs 6&ndash;9).   My 
principal aim in writing about <i>overlapping hemiolas</i>&mdash;a succession of two hemiolas that is
collapsed into three measures in each voice in which it appears&mdash;was
in fact to offer a detailed theoretical account of an important
phenomenon not previously described in the scholarly literature.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
Even though I tried to place my remarks within the wider compositional
context of each piece, I made no attempt to offer a broader analytical
perspective, let alone a historical or intertextual one.  To have done
so would have entailed an extended discussion of each composition&rsquo;s
topical and generic features, features complex enough to warrant a
separate full-length study.  In the present reply I plan to offer just
such a study, of the G-minor Sarabande, and to examine the relation of
its topical features to its long-span rhetoric.  I hope to show how
the Sarabande can be approached analytically as a unique work of art
despite its similarity to other sarabandes, and to demonstrate that
the flexibility required by such an approach precludes treatment of
the piece as a &ldquo;fixed or ideal (real) object&rdquo; (Schulenberg, paragraph
3).
<p>

[3]  The distinction Hatten draws between marked 
and unmarked materials
is most helpful when we attempt to define what is special about the
Sarabande.  A stretch of the composition is marked when it stands out
from among the surrounding passages in some way, especially in its
topical, stylistic, or thematic design.  A passage remains unmarked if
it fits in with the norms the piece has had a chance to establish.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> These notions are essential to gauging the 
first-time listener&rsquo;s
participation because the listener will usually expect a good deal of
the familiar in any potential addition to his or her listening
repertoire, along with the novel and the unfamiliar.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> They can also
be applied to different types of structure at various levels, greatly
facilitating the composition&rsquo;s placement in a wider stylistic and
generic context.  Among the differences between Schulenberg&rsquo;s outlook
and mine is a divergence in approach to markedness, apparent even
though Schulenberg doesn&rsquo;t use any semiotic terminology.  The hemiolic
passages from the Sarabande and from the Musette from Handel&rsquo;s
Concerto Grosso in G minor, op. 6, no. 6, that I view as marked emerge
as both nonhemiolic and unmarked in Schulenberg&rsquo;s response (paragraphs
7&ndash;11). <p>

[4]  The appearance of hemiolas is, I believe, 
usually a marked event
because the small-scale, temporary metrical hierarchy the hemiolas
suggest conflicts with the prevailing metrical grid.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Furthermore,
the surface adjustments that create hemiolas&mdash;changes in grouping,
pace, and thematic design&mdash;are often emphatically marked as well.  But
even when hemiolic passages appear to replicate unmarked formulaic
cliches that recur in dozens of pieces they may nonetheless be
transformed by the tensions of the composition&rsquo;s unfolding narratives
into decidedly marked progressions.  The major 
attribute of marked
passages is not necessarily their novelty as such but rather the
narrative friction they generate against earlier progressions that the
compositional process has left unmarked.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> It is to the reification
of such friction that the listener intuitively responds in assaying
the challenge of a new piece.<p>

[5] Both at the surface and at deeper levels of generic structure the
opposition between marked and unmarked material reflects the narrative
schemes that (in tandem with tonal and durational structure) hold
tonal compositions together.  In retracing these schemes through the
foreground and across the generic form of the piece, it is often
helpful to specify the generic level of the issue in question. I
employ Hatten&rsquo;s <i>stylistic level</i> to refer to surface issues, and 
his 
<i>strategic level</i> to denote large-scale matters, such as the
rhetorical ordering of groups and sections.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> At the very foreground,
I find it most helpful to employ the notion of topic (made familiar
through the work of Ratner, Agawu, and others) to designate the idioms
most closely associated with the genre under discussion.  Topics in
Handel&rsquo;s G-minor Sarabande include the characteristic pairs of
repeated notes on the first and second beats of many measures, the
preponderance of durational accents on many second beats, the use of
characteristic chordal and intervallic textures in thematic areas, and
(on a somewhat larger scale) the predominantly stepwise underlying
progressions as well as the uniform division into eight-bar phrases
and four-bar subphrases.  Although the hemiola is 
not a sarabande 
<i>topic</i> as such, it appears in sarabandes rather more frequently 
than
Schulenberg intimates (paragraph 8), as a glance through the
literature quickly reveals.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> In 
their own home genre, topical
passages are (at least at the outset) essentially unmarked since they
are familiar to the listener who has heard many exemplars of the
genre.  But when the same topical passages make guest appearances in
other genres, as they often do, they acquire a decidedly marked
quality.  In Handel&rsquo;s G-minor Sarabande, topical 
passages appear only
on their own turf and remain unmarked until the Sarabande&rsquo;s narrative
scheme transforms them into marked passages, in the later stages of
the piece.  Such transformation may be regarded as <i>thematic</i>,
achieved through a process of <i>thematization</i>, when it supports the
narrative discourse at the strategic level.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> <p>

[6] Among the most important issues that need to be reexamined here is
the extent of the listener&rsquo;s intuitively intertextual response to the
presentation of early eighteenth-century genres, a central concern of
Schulenberg&rsquo;s.  I should like to defer detailed consideration of this
issue to the closing paragraphs of my reply because it is dependent on
the outcome of a tonal, durational, and narrative analysis of Handel&rsquo;s
Sarabande, and on a reappraisal of its hemiolas.</p>

<p>[7] Handel&rsquo;s Sarabande is reproduced in its entirety in <b>Example 1</b>. It divides into four phrases of eight bars, and each phrase divides
further into two subphrases of four bars.  The opening subphrase, bars
1&ndash;4, at once lays out the Sarabande&rsquo;s gallery of topical, unmarked
idioms.  The durational accents on the second beat in each measure are
underlined in bars 1 and 3 by dissonant passing tones in the bass; the
essentially stepwise movement of the outer voices at the level of the
measure, which outlines parallel fifths in bars 1&ndash;2 and parallel
tenths in bars 3&ndash;4, is broken up discreetly on the last quarter note
of bars 1&ndash;3 by ancillary falling fifths in first inversion or root
position.  The only marked features of this subphrase are the
upper-voice leaps that introduce the repeated-note figures at the turn
of bars 2 and 3, and the surprising disjunction between the groups of
parallel fifths and tenths at bar 3; these portend more strongly
marked disruption ahead.</p>


<p>[8]  The structural parameter that mediates 
between the presentation of
topical material in bars 1&ndash;4 and its thematization later on is what I
call the <i>basic pace</i>, the largely stepwise movement of the outer
voices in their unembellished, unexpanded, and normalized state.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> In the early eighteenth-century repertoire, the basic pace shines clearly through the textures of the foreground except when it is
hidden by the temporary prominence of subservient, faster paces; the
rate of its progress differs from meter to meter, and it frequently
undergoes expansion and contraction to slower and faster motion.  From
time to time it is modified by arpeggiation and by the retention or
repetition of essential tones.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
The upper level of the durational
reduction of bars 1&ndash;8 in <b>Example 2</b> shows the basic pace in bars 1&ndash;4 as
a series of dotted half notes; observe how the ancillary voice leading
at the close of bars 1, 2, and 3 is phased out at the upper level to
reveal its one-to-the-bar movement.</p>


<p>
[9] The second subphrase, bars 5&ndash;8, introduces an abundance of tonal
and durational intensifications, beginning with the contradiction of
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>4 (bar 4) by <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5 (bar 5); its contents consequently
become wholly marked.  With the entrance of the first hemiola in bar
5, the basic pace accelerates to movement in whole notes (half notes
in the upper level of Example 2), transforming the durational outline
of the progression we&rsquo;ve just heard.  The outer voices continue to
move in parallel tenths, just as they did in bars 3&ndash;4, and their
movement continues to be broken up in similar fashion by ancillary
falling fifths, which now appear exclusively in root position (compare
the two levels of tonal reduction in <b>Example 3</b>).  But the progression
as a whole moves considerably faster than it did before. At the higher level (the upper reduction in Example 2), it continues 
through bar 6 and comprises three parallel tenths, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;D3,
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;C3, and D5&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3, each tenth occupying two-thirds of a
measure.  The tenth <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;D3 proceeds to the tenth <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;C3
on the third beat of bar 5; that is why we hear these two tenths as a
first and a second hemiolic beat.  At the lower level (the lower
reduction in Example 2) the continuation of the tenth <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;C3 to
the tenth D5&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 is upstaged at the downbeat of bar 6 by the
entrance of the second hemiola, which begins right on the
voice-leading chord intervening between the two tenths and extends the
chord for two beats, rather than one.  Evidently, the second hemiola
is not supported by the basic pace and appears at a lower level of
structure than the first.<p>

[10] As John Rothgeb perceptively pointed out on mto-talk (April 5,
1996), the third tenth&mdash;the third hemiolic beat&mdash;of the first hemiola
is not entirely usurped by the entrance of the second hemiola.
Rather, it is displaced, from the second to the third beat of bar 6,
where D5&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 continues the earlier tenths and at the same time
supplies the second hemiolic beat of the second hemiola.  The second
hemiola then concludes with the arrival of a <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>&mdash;<nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> progression over
F on the second beat of bar 7.  The upper reduction in Example 2
reveals that above and beyond this hemiolic intensification an
additional, cadential acceleration in the basic pace takes place at
the downbeat of bar 7, further delaying the restoration of the
original one-bar pace to the arrival of the mediant in bar 8.  The
reduction also demonstrates how the second hemiola, unsupported by the
basic pace, all but disappears in the middleground.<p>

[11] My reasons for reading the second hemiola in the foreground are
both durational and tonal.  Durationally, bars 6 and 7 divide into
three distinct and equal stretches: A whole note occupies the first
two beats of bar 6 and another whole note (in the form of the dominant
tonicizing the key of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> with a <nobr><img border="0" alt="6 4" src="../../gifs/64.gif" width="8" height="15" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr>&ndash;<nobr><img border="0" alt="5 3" src="../../gifs/53.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> progression overhead)
takes up the last two beats of bar 7; in between, on the last beat of
bar 6 and through the downbeat of bar 7, a sustained movement in
quarter notes defines an equally long stretch.  The movement in
quarter notes passes through the downbeat of bar 7 without marking it
as such.  Tonally (see again Example 3), the chord on G at the
downbeat of bar 7 serves as an arpeggiated connective between the more
substantial chord on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> on the third beat of bar 6, the last of
the first hemiola&rsquo;s three parallel tenths, and the significant chord
on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> on the second quarter note of bar 7, the II<sup>6</sup> of an
auxiliary cadence establishing the mediant (the bass <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> appears,
registrally displaced, in the small rather than in the great octave).
The emergence of the second hemiola from the 
displacements of bar 6
into the cadential limelight of bar 7 is, like the acceleration
occasioned by the first hemiola, a dramatic event; despite the
familiarity of its upper voice in bar 7 as a cadential cliche in early
Handel, the hemiola is perceived as a marked rather than as an
unmarked progression.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> That the 
emphasis on the second beat of bar
7 coincides with the Sarabande&rsquo;s topical second-beat accent is of
course true (Schulenberg, paragraph 7), but the accent here, as such,
results from the tripartite division of bars 6 and 7 taken as a whole,
not from the recurrence of the Sarabande topic we encountered in each
of bars 1&ndash;4.  Indeed, the rapid succession and 
great density of events
in bars 5&ndash;8 represents the point at which the Sarabande breaks away
from the familiar topics and stylistic norms by which it was
identified as a Sarabande in bars 1&ndash;4&mdash;the point, in other words,
where its surface begins to assume a larger thematic identity uniquely
its own.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> As a result of this 
leap for freedom, the remarkable
contrast between bars 1&ndash;4 and bars 5&ndash;8 comes into play as a major
feature of the composition. </p>

<p>

[12] In bars 9&ndash;12, the first subphrase of the Sarabande&rsquo;s second
phrase, the topically familiar setting of bars 1&ndash;4 returns.  Although
repeated notes, as such, appear only in the bass of bar 9, chordal
accents on each second beat are once again highly conspicuous,
supported by dissonant intervallic sonorities (including prominent
augmented fourths) in bars 9 and 11, and by a surprising G-major chord
in bar 12 that seems to announce the following subphrase prematurely,
entering a mere one beat after the key of F major has been locally
tonicized.  As the bilevel durational reduction 
of bars 9&ndash;16 in
<b>Example 4</b> demonstrates, the one-bar basic pace prevails throughout the
subphrase and describes an underlying descent of a fourth from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3
to F3 in the bass (note the implicit anticipation of F5, which arrives
in bar 10, atop the upper voice of bar 9).<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> The brief tonicization of F in bar 12 represents the first leg in an
unfolding of the bass fifths, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&mdash;F and G&mdash;C, which ultimately leads
to the tonicization of C, the subdominant, in bar 16 (see the tonal
reduction of bars 9&ndash;16 in <b>Example 5</b>; I shall explain the role of the
G-major chord in bar 12 later on).  In all, the contents of bars 9&ndash;12
are essentially unmarked, just as were those of bars 1&ndash;4.  (See my
original article, paragraph 10, for more about the parallelisms between
bars 1&ndash;8 and 9&ndash;16.)
<p>

[13] The second subphrase, bars 13&ndash;16, again 
shows dramatic markedness
and offers contrasts that, despite some attenuation, parallel those in
bars 5&ndash;8.  These contrasts are underlined by the quarter-note rests in
bars 13 and 14, which derive quite explicitly from the rests in bars
1&ndash;3 but operate in a very different way.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> In bars 1&ndash;3, the rests
stand for the entrance of ancillary chords and displace each chord to
the last quarter note of the measure (see the lower level of Example
2); both the rests and the chords enter well away from the steps of
the basic pace, which treads at the downbeat.  In bars 13 and 14, the
rests stand for (and delay the appearance of) appoggiatura-like chords
that embellish a two-measure, essentially hemiolic bass arpeggiation
of an F-minor chord.  The durational reductions 
in Example 4 show both
how the rests displace the &ldquo;appoggiatura&rdquo; chords by a quarter note and
how the combined time-span of each rest-and-chord pair in turn
postpones the arrival of each arpeggio tone by a half note.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> Here
the basic pace temporarily abandons its stepwise progress in order to
outline the three hemiolic steps of the F-minor arpeggiation; as in
bars 5&ndash;6, it accelerates to movement in whole notes (half notes in the
upper level of Example 4).  The first of the three steps, in bar 13,
is delayed by the half-note &ldquo;appoggiatura&rdquo; chord at the downbeat; the
second and the third steps are delayed by the combined rest-and-chord
pairs, and consequently appear, at the surface, in bar 14.  From the
perspective of the foreground, then, the first of the two overlapping
hemiolas in bars 13&ndash;15 is expressed, implicitly, by the rests in bars
13 and 14 (see my article, paragraph 10); from the perspective of the
middleground, it is expressed by the normalized F-minor arpeggiation.
Although the progression in bars 13 and 14, as such, is hardly unusual
and the texture of the two measures remains very simple, its
underlying complexity and circumstantial rhythmic dissonance (to which
I believe our listener, like Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;less learned&rdquo; auditor, will
intuitively respond) certainly sets it off for markedness.
<p>

[14] The displaced C-minor chord on the last beat of bar 14 not only
brings the first, implicit hemiola to a close but also signals the
emergence of the second, more explicit hemiola.  Like its counterpart
in bars 6&ndash;7, the second hemiola is not structurally supported by the
basic pace; but unlike its counterpart, it is not cued at the outset
by a change in the design, so that one becomes aware of it only when
it is already in progress.  If the hemiolas in bars 5&ndash;7 are
rhetorically disruptive, those in bars 13&ndash;15 can be viewed as
reticent, but their impact is equally substantial.  (The basic pace
again accelerates cadentially in bar 15, just as it did in bar 7, and
the second hemiola again resides at a level closer to the surface than
the first.  As the reductions show, it too disappears at the higher
level, while the hidden first hemiola stays put.)</p>


<p>[15] We are now in a position to go back and examine the significance
of the G-major chord on the second beat of bar 12.  As a locally
applied dominant to the C-minor sixth chord that enters in bar 13, the
G-major chord resides within the time-span of the inherently measure-long F-major chord of bar 12 (see Example 4).  The disruption it
occasions is due both to its early contradiction of F (through the
alteration of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>) and to its unique position within
the Sarabande&mdash;no other chord links two subphrases in similar fashion
elsewhere in the piece.  The chord performs several tasks: It
accentuates the contrast between the two subphrases even as it welds
them (the movement of the lower voices in parallel tenths in bar 12
prepares for that of the outer-voices in bar 13); it helps simulate
the ascent of a not-quite-linear third progression in the bass,
F3&mdash;G3&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3, across bars 12&ndash;14, in improvisatory imitation of the
upper voice&rsquo;s D5&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;F5 in bars 9&ndash;10 and, at a deeper level,
in bars 9&ndash;12 (see the brackets in the tonal reduction in Example 5);
it prepares for the unfolding of a similarly simulated &ldquo;third,&rdquo;
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3&mdash;F3&mdash;G3, by the bass in bars 13&ndash;15; and it offers a buffer
between the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr>4 of bar 12 and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5 of bar 13.  When both voice leading and duration are reduced 
to their essentials, it
seems that the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> and <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> do in fact connect, in imitation of
the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> connection in bars 4&ndash;5, as Floyd K.  Grave
suggested (see my article, footnote 4).<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> In cushioning this progression
and offering instead a differently disruptive chromatic alteration, the
G-major chord simply displaces the chromatic &ldquo;shock&rdquo; of bar 5 by two
beats to a new location within the phrase.
<p>

[16] A casual audition of the third phrase, bars 17&ndash;24, would seem to
indicate that its two constituent subphrases, bars 17&ndash;20 and 21&ndash;24,
relate to each other in much the same way as did the subphrases in the
two earlier phrases.  Not only do bars 17&ndash;20 revert to the potentially
unmarked rhythms, figurations, and one-bar pace of the typical
Sarabande opening; their almost exclusively stepwise design recalls
that of the typical Sarabande rather more closely than does the more
disjunct contour of bars 1&ndash;4.  The effect of 
this subphrase seems to
be that of <i>reculer pour mieux sauter</i>&mdash;a lessening of tension in
preparation for more developmental events yet to evolve.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> But
appearances in this instance are highly deceptive.  The resumption of
sarabande topics dispenses with the characteristic rests of bars 1&ndash;4
and substitutes full chordal texture for the lean three-voice setting
of the opening measures, and it shows a sudden temporary acceleration
in the basic pace (bar 19) to movement in half and whole notes
(quarter notes and half notes in the durational reduction in Example
6).  Furthermore, it enters half a step higher than did the opening of
the Sarabande (a move whose significance will become apparent later
on).  These changes suggest that the subphrase is 
more developmental
than it seems to be&mdash;that its Sarabande topics are in the process of
becoming marked and thematized.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup>

<p>
[17] The second subphrase assumes a similarly deceptive appearance.
Its displaced recollection of bars 13&ndash;14 (discussed below) and of bars
1&ndash;3 (Schulenberg, paragraph 14), and its cadentially intensified bass
movement, which straddles the bar line at the turn of bar 23, allow
the subphrase to feign the marked developmental quality for which the
preceding subphrase seemed to prepare.  But its basic pace accelerates
only at the cadence, in bar 23 (see <b>Example 6</b>), allowing the upper
voices&mdash;for the first time in a second subphrase&mdash;to make full use in
each measure of the Sarabande&rsquo;s second-beat accents; it offers only
hemiolic reminiscences, not fully realized hemiolas (see my article,
paragraph 12); and, in contrast to the active arpeggiation and
extension of F minor in bars 13&ndash;15, its bass line suggests a
stationary extension of a <nobr>II<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> chord from the downbeat of bar 21 to
the downbeat of bar 23.  (The voice leading here is rather more complex than that, as the
reduction in <b>Example 7</b> discloses, but the effect of an uneventful
extension obtains nonetheless.)  The combination of a steady one-bar
pace and a static harmonic setting considerably weakens both the degree
of contrast offered by the subphrase and the degree of markedness it
assumes.</p>

<p>[18] Appearances in the third phrase are deceptive in yet another
respect. The tonal reduction in Example 7 indicates that the phrase
closes with a bass ascent to G, the upper fifth of the subdominant, C.
The tonicization of G minor in bar 24 does not really signal a return
to the tonic (which is completely regained only at the end of the
piece); it provides a contrapuntal milieu for the startling appearance
of the minor dominant at the beginning of the fourth phrase, in bar 25
(see Example 7), a chord that recalls the D-minor sonority of bar 5.<p>

<p>
[19] The two subphrases of the fourth phrase&mdash;bars 25&ndash;28 and 29&ndash;32&mdash;
bring to fruition the twist suggested in the third phrase.  Although
bars 25&ndash;28 again offer the potentially unmarked Sarabande topics of
bars 1&ndash;4, and bars 29&ndash;32 repeat bars 21&ndash;24 (an instance of a <i>petite
reprise</i>, as Schulenberg correctly observes, though one that occurs
under altered tonal circumstances), the relationship between the two
subphrases now changes entirely.  The Sarabande 
topics enter over the
harmonically unexpected minor dominant, in full chordal texture, and
in a still higher register&mdash;a step higher than the topics in bars
17ff., and two steps higher than those in bars 1&ndash;4&mdash;and the basic pace
undergoes sustained acceleration, to an alternation of half notes and
whole notes in both bars 26 and 27 (quarter notes and half notes in
the upper level of the durational reduction in <b>Example 8</b>).<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> 
Together, these changes generate the explicitly marked quality that
bars 17&ndash;20 did not yet possess; the Sarabande topics have now become
fully thematized.  Note how the acceleration in 
bars 26&ndash;27 coincides
with the contrapuntal deployment of chromatically inflected dominant
and subdominant chords, and how bars 25&ndash;27 suggest hidden, overlapping
hemiolas (as I pointed out in my article, paragraph 12 and Example
5).<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> Particularly striking is the 
recollection of bar 5&mdash;the
Sarabande&rsquo;s thematic turning point&mdash;at the downbeat of bar 25.  The
very same chord that announced the thematization of the second
subphrase now proclaims that of the first.  When we compare the
tension accumulated in bars 25&ndash;28 to the sense of peroration
occasioned by the repetition in bars 29&ndash;32, we realize how unmarked
the contents of the second subphrase have become. 
They simply
reinforce the harmonic stasis of the <nobr>II<img border="0" alt="6 5" src="../../gifs/65.gif" width="7" height="16" style="vertical-align:text-top"></nobr> extension they simulate,
and they provide an eminently suitable set of closing gestures for the
Suite&rsquo;s slow movement.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> <p>

[20] Looking back now at the relations among the subphrases throughout
the Sarabande, we can retrace in more organized fashion the narrative
implications of the gradual reversal in their relationship.  In
transferring the realization of markedness and thematization a few
steps at a time from the second subphrase to the first, and in
shifting the strategic emphasis from the thematization of hemiolic
progressions to the thematization of Sarabande rhythms and topics,
Handel recounts a narrative plot that is based on the most common
features of the Sarabande&rsquo;s generic topics.  The reversal in
markedness represents Handel&rsquo;s way of thematizing the Sarabande&rsquo;s
generic division into eight-bar phrases and four-bar subphrases.  Even
when Handel moves away from Sarabande topics through the introduction
of atopical hemiolas at the stylistic level, he does so for the sake
of thematizing the topics at the higher strategic level, through the
articulation of sharp contrasts between the subphrases.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Thus the
acceleration of the basic pace, which plays a major role in each
thematization, makes repeated use of the Sarabande&rsquo;s second-beat
emphases, whose tonal and durational activation (as in bars 5 or 13)
allows each acceleration to get underway; chromatic shifts, similarly
thematic, occur either at the beginning of subphrases, realizing their
markedness (bars 5, 25), or on the second beat (bars 12, 26).  If we
remain sensitive to both the narrative and the intertextual
significance of this ongoing give and take between topic and
markedness we shall, I think, avoid the danger of treating the
Sarabande as a fixed object. <p>

[21]  Adopting a stance rather narrower than the 
wide stylistic and
strategic vantage markedness theory requires, several scholars have
recently suggested that genre is the one element of the design
(unlike, say, style or structure) in which the listener participates
directly through his or her familiarity with other generic exemplars
and through his or her expectation that, up to a point, any new piece
will in many ways resemble a substantial body of familiar pieces.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> In a highly influential study, Jeffrey Kallberg 
has even likened genre
to a contract between the composer and the listener; adherence to the
contract is the basis for the composer&rsquo;s discourse, but the contract
is liable to be broken at any time.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> A composition&rsquo;s identity might
thus be determined by departures from generic norms at the stylistic
level occasioned by external plots or incentives at the strategic
level that do not necessarily relate to the foreground in a
particularly close way.  One problem with 
applying such a view (along
with a constricted view of the listener&rsquo;s competence or participation)
to early eighteenth-century music is that generic norms and
prescriptions at the strategic level are loosely defined in this
repertoire, while stylistic topics (such as the sarabande topics we&rsquo;ve
been dealing with) are set quite firmly in place.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> An analytical
account of high-Baroque genres should take into account the close
links that exist between topics and topic-related events at the
stylistic level and the narrative schemes that organize them, through
markedness and thematization, at the strategic level.  The topical
norms of each genre, unmarked though they may be, contain elements of
potential tension whose realization and resolution call for the
intervention of a narrative scheme.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> <p>

[22] The organization and ordering of generic 
topics by large-scale
narrative or rhetorical strategies is hardly a new idea; it forms the
basis of important recent works dealing with late eighteenth- and
early nineteenth-century repertoires by Elaine Sisman, Scott Burnham,
and others.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> The difficulty in 
reconstructing the narrative
strategies of early eighteenth-century music resides in the brevity,
small scale, and surface uniformity of its constituent pieces, which
often seem to be rhetorically cryptic.  I believe it is nonetheless
essential for both analyst and listener to attempt such
reconstructions if they are to experience the essence of this
repertoire.  This, in fact, was the unstated 
assumption of my
article&mdash;not verbalized as such, but clearly implied by my comments on
the larger course of events in the Sarabande (paragraphs 10&ndash;12) and in
my remarks on the introduction and dissipation of hemiolic tension in
the Musette from the G-minor Concerto Grosso, op. 6, no. 6 (paragraphs
17&ndash;18).<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> <p>

[23] It is of course by no means certain that the 
listener&rsquo;s plot will
coincide with the composer&rsquo;s or the analyst&rsquo;s, or with the
performer&rsquo;s, for that matter.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> 
The analyst might attempt to
reconstruct what he or she believes is the composer&rsquo;s own strategy or
plot, with the hope that the results, backed up by a sound scholarly
apparatus, will gain some sort of validity and acceptance.  The
listener, possessing few of the analyst&rsquo;s sophisticated tools, might
by contrast try to construct an ad hoc, homemade scheme.  But the
process involved will be fundamentally the same.  Thus even if in bars
5&ndash;7 of Handel&rsquo;s G-minor Sarabande &ldquo;virtually every detail of its
rhythm, melody, and harmony is a formula that can be found in other
examples of this same genre,&rdquo; and even if (unlikely as it seems to me)
&ldquo;many such listeners may not even be able to recall, during a
performance, whether a &lsquo;reference&rsquo; at, say, measure 25, is to a previous
point in the same piece or to a similar passage in another one&rdquo;
(Schulenberg, paragraph 12), I would maintain that both analyst and
listener will approach such passages first and foremost as unique
moments in a unique work of art that tells a unique story.  Their
interpretations will depend less on their capacity to recognize the
intertextual roots of such passages as they will depend on their
capacity to interpret the unique use to which these roots are put in
relation to what they have just heard and in relation to what they are
about to hear.  For the listener as well as the analyst, making the
acquaintance of Handel&rsquo;s G-minor Sarabande is therefore apt to be an
active, creative experience; neither is likely to take the composer&rsquo;s
word on faith.</p>

996&ndash;1996&rdquo; (see fn. 2), entitled &ldquo;Austrian Collections at the New York
Public Library: Heinrich Schenker&rsquo;s Manuscripts in the Oster
Collection,&rdquo; I took Schenker to task for some of the same reasons
Schulenberg chides me.  I maintained that Schenker, eager to find
structural similarities between the Sarabande from Bach&rsquo;s E-minor
English Suite and other tonal pieces, overlooked the significance of
its distinctly high-Baroque rhythmic and registral characteristics,
including its generic topics.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> Hatten, <i>Musical Meaning</i>, Chapter 5, 
especially pages 117&ndash;18.<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> I introduced the notion of basic pace in a paper 
entitled &ldquo;Sequential Expansion and Handelian Phrase Rhythm,&rdquo; first presented at
the Fifth Biennial Conference on Baroque Music in Edinburgh (July,
1994); the paper will appear in Carl Schachter and Hedi Siegel, eds., 
<i>Schenker Studies 2</i>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, in
preparation).  I assume that the reader is familiar with the procedure
of normalization, which restores a chord&rsquo;s original, usually longer
time-span at levels deeper than the foreground (provided the chord has
survived the initial stages of reduction).  For an authoritative
discussion see William Rothstein, &ldquo;Rhythmic Displacement and Rhythmic
Normalization,&rdquo; in Allen Cadwallader, ed., <i>Trends in Schenkerian
Research</i> (New York: Schirmer Books, 1990), pages 87&ndash;114, with further
references.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> Fluctuations in the basic pace, which play a 
central role in the articulation of high-Baroque phrase rhythm, most often involve the
expansion or double expansion of the pace, but contractions occur as
well.  In the present Sarabande, only contractions take place.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> The frequent appearance of this melodic outline 
throughout Handel&rsquo;s very early oeuvre, and its infrequent recurrence in his later
works, have been meticulously documented by Terence Best; see, for
instance, Best&rsquo;s &ldquo;Die Chronologie von Handels Klaviermusik,&rdquo; 
<i>Handel-Jahrbuch</i>, vol. 27 (1981), pages 82&ndash;84.  As I noted in my
article, the G-minor Sarabande was composed around 1703&ndash;1706.<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> I shall later address the extent to which the 
Sarabande&rsquo;s departures from its topics are nonetheless grounded in the topics&rsquo;
tonal and durational properties.  For a discussion of beginnings in a
similar context see Agawu, <i>Playing with Signs</i>, pages 56&ndash;58.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> The implication of F5 in bar 9 is based on a very 
common early bass descent from I to a tonicized V (in the key of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, in this instance) that involves a preliminary two-bar retention of <span style='font-size:0.8em'><math><mover><mn>5</mn><mo>&#710;</mo></mover></math></span> in the upper voice.  See, for instance, Handel&rsquo;s Chaconne with 62 variations from the Suite in G, HWV 442, Variation 8.  Like Schenker&rsquo;s leading linear progression, which governs a set of simultaneous linear progressions, one of the basic pace&rsquo;s two essential voices usually predominates.  In bars 1&ndash;8, for instance, it is (arguably) the upper voice; in bars 9&ndash;16 it is (clearly) the bass.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> There is a sense, too, in which the progression in 
bar 13 (through the downbeat of bar 14) offers a telescoped and inverted allusion to
the outline of bars 1&ndash;4, an intensification that contributes to the
markedness of the second subphrase.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> As the bass rises through the three tones of the 
F-minor triad, the upper voice accommodates its motion; hence the C-minor chord at
the end of bar 14.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> John Rothgeb&rsquo;s observation (mto-talk, April 5,

foreground.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> On <i>reculer pour mieux sauter</i> see Edward T. 
Cone, <i>Musical Form and Musical Performance</i> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1968),
page 24.<br><a href="#FN19REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN20">20.</a> For a theoretical account of this type of 
thematicization see Hatten, <i>Musical Meaning</i>, pages 117&ndash;19.<br><a href="#FN20REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN21">21.</a> By association, the openings of the three 
sarabande-topic subphrases (bars 1&ndash;4, 17&ndash;20, and 25&ndash;28) outline the rising &ldquo;third,&rdquo;
D5&mdash;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>5&mdash;F5.  Though possibly fortuitous, the parallelism with
the rising thirds (not a linear progression as such) bracketed in
Example 5 is striking.  That this long-span, simulated ascent occurs
just at the points where the Sarabande topics return suggests that
each reference to these topics represents a forward step, an
intensification in the Sarabande&rsquo;s narrative schemes.<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> Evidently, I now assign considerably greater 
developmental significance to bars 25&ndash;28 (and to the last two phrases of the
Sarabande in general) than I did when I prepared my original article.<br><a href="#FN22REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN23">23.</a> Though this is common and sensible strategy, it is 
by no means mandatory for Sarabandes to close with a <i>denouement</i>; a good 
number end climactically (Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barry Lyndon&rdquo; Sarabande, from the D-minor
Suite, HWV 437, for instance, or the Sarabande from Bach&rsquo;s A-major English Suite, BWV 806).<br><a href="#FN23REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN24">24.</a> It is interesting to note how the contrasting 
temporalities of the subphrases in bars 1&ndash;8 and 9&ndash;16 merge into a relatively streamlined
temporality in bars 17&ndash;32 with the abandonment, at the surface, of the
overlapping hemiolas.<br><a href="#FN24REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN25">25.</a> See, for instance, Jim Samson, <i>Chopin, The Four 
Ballades</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), Chapter 4, with
further references.<br><a href="#FN25REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN26">26.</a> Kallberg, &ldquo;The Rhetoric of Genre: Chopin&rsquo;s Nocturne

the application of external ideas to the analysis of this repertoire is Schulenberg&rsquo;s

characteristic local fluctuations in the basic pace create durational oppositions at the
stylistic level whose extended resolution at the strategic level often
shapes the course of the entire movement.  In the concerto, these
fluctuations pit the three sections of the ritornello (<i>Vordersatz</i>, <i>Fortspinnung</i>, 
and <i>Epilog</i>) against each other at the outset; both
the ordering of solo and tutti passages later on and the internal
articulation of each solo and ritornello group typically offer
long-term narrative responses to such initial confrontations.  I
discussed this issue in some detail in &ldquo;Adjacency and Counterstress:
Applying Durational Reduction to Baroque Music,&rdquo; paper delivered at
the 1995 annual meeting of SMT in New York.<br><a href="#FN28REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN29">29.</a> Elaine R. Sisman, <i>Haydn and the Classical

<i>Beethoven Hero</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995).<br><a href="#FN29REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN30">30.</a> As a generic piece, Handel&rsquo;s Musette resembles a 
pastorale rather
more closely than a French chaconne, <i>pace</i> Burney (see Schulenberg,
paragraph 8).  Rather than being &ldquo;predisposed against hearing
hemiolas&rdquo; here, the historically informed listener may in fact expect
them, for the Musette&rsquo;s essential materials are borrowed from the
hemiolic aria, &ldquo;Wandelt in der Liebe,&rdquo; from Telemann&rsquo;s Cantata of the
same name, no. 16 in his <i>Der Harmonische Gottesdienst</i>; see 
Ellwood
Derr, &ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Procedures for Composing with Materials from
Telemann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst&rsquo; [sic] in &lsquo;Solomon,&rsquo;&rdquo; 
<i>G&ouml;ttinger Handel-Beitr&auml;ge</i>, vol. 1 (Kassel: Barenreiter, 1984), page 144.  It is possible, too, that these materials are borrowed from the
hemiolic aria, &ldquo;Son confusa pastorella,&rdquo; from Handel&rsquo;s own <i>Poro</i>,
which is based on the same Telemann aria; see John H. Roberts,
&ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Borrowings from Telemann: An Inventory,&rdquo; in the same issue
of the <i>Beitr&auml;ge</i>, page 157.  The hemiolic idiom Handel employs in 
bars 11&ndash;13 (a rather more elaborate idiom than Telemann&rsquo;s) was in fact part
of the French dance-suite style around the time the Concerti Grossi,
op. 6, were composed (1739).  Rameau used it, for instance, in bars
5&ndash;7 of the first Menuet from the Suite in G (from the <i>Nouvelles
Suites de Pieces de Clavecin</i>, 1728), and again in the Menuet&rsquo;s 
vastly
expanded solo, orchestral, and choral transcription (at &ldquo;Naissez, dons
de Flore&rdquo;) in Scene 2 of the Prologue to <i>Castor et Pollux</i> 
(1737).<br><a href="#FN30REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN31">31.</a> As William Rothstein recently pointed out, the construction of
such narratives is an essential part of the interpretative process a
performer goes through.  See Rothstein, &ldquo;Analysis and the Act of
Performance,&rdquo; in John Rink, ed., <i>The Practice of Performance</i>

entitled &ldquo;Sequential Expansion and Handelian Phrase Rhythm,&rdquo; first presented at
the Fifth Biennial Conference on Baroque Music in Edinburgh (July,
1994); the paper will appear in Carl Schachter and Hedi Siegel, eds., 
<i>Schenker Studies 2</i>(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, in
preparation).  I assume that the reader is familiar with the procedure
of normalization, which restores a chord&rsquo;s original, usually longer
time-span at levels deeper than the foreground (provided the chord has
survived the initial stages of reduction).  For an authoritative
discussion see William Rothstein, &ldquo;Rhythmic Displacement and Rhythmic
Normalization,&rdquo; in Allen Cadwallader, ed., <i>Trends in Schenkerian
Research</i> (New York: Schirmer Books, 1990), pages 87&ndash;114, with further
references.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">Fluctuations in the basic pace, which play a 
central role in the articulation of high-Baroque phrase rhythm, most often involve the
expansion or double expansion of the pace, but contractions occur as
well.  In the present Sarabande, only contractions take place.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">The frequent appearance of this melodic outline 
throughout Handel&rsquo;s very early oeuvre, and its infrequent recurrence in his later
works, have been meticulously documented by Terence Best; see, for
instance, Best&rsquo;s &ldquo;Die Chronologie von Handels Klaviermusik,&rdquo; 
<i>Handel-Jahrbuch</i>, vol. 27 (1981), pages 82&ndash;84.  As I noted in my
article, the G-minor Sarabande was composed around 1703&ndash;1706.</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">I shall later address the extent to which the 
Sarabande&rsquo;s departures from its topics are nonetheless grounded in the topics&rsquo;
tonal and durational properties.  For a discussion of beginnings in a
similar context see Agawu, <i>Playing with Signs</i>, pages 56&ndash;58.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">The implication of F5 in bar 9 is based on a very 
common early bass descent from I to a tonicized V (in the key of B&#x266d;, in this instance) that involves a preliminary two-bar retention of 5&#710; in the upper voice.  See, for instance, Handel&rsquo;s Chaconne with 62 variations from the Suite in G, HWV 442, Variation 8.  Like Schenker&rsquo;s leading linear progression, which governs a set of simultaneous linear progressions, one of the basic pace&rsquo;s two essential voices usually predominates.  In bars 1&ndash;8, for instance, it is (arguably) the upper voice; in bars 9&ndash;16 it is (clearly) the bass.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">There is a sense, too, in which the progression in 
bar 13 (through the downbeat of bar 14) offers a telescoped and inverted allusion to
the outline of bars 1&ndash;4, an intensification that contributes to the
markedness of the second subphrase.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">As the bass rises through the three tones of the 
F-minor triad, the upper voice accommodates its motion; hence the C-minor chord at
the end of bar 14.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">John Rothgeb&rsquo;s observation (mto-talk, April 5, 
1996) that the A&#x266e; and A&#x266d; do not connect nonetheless still holds in the
foreground.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">On <i>reculer pour mieux sauter</i> see Edward T. 
Cone, <i>Musical Form and Musical Performance</i> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1968),
page 24.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">For a theoretical account of this type of 
thematicization see Hatten, <i>Musical Meaning</i>, pages 117&ndash;19.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">By association, the openings of the three 
sarabande-topic subphrases (bars 1&ndash;4, 17&ndash;20, and 25&ndash;28) outline the rising &ldquo;third,&rdquo;
D5&mdash;E&#x266d;5&mdash;F5.  Though possibly fortuitous, the parallelism with
the rising thirds (not a linear progression as such) bracketed in
Example 5 is striking.  That this long-span, simulated ascent occurs
just at the points where the Sarabande topics return suggests that
each reference to these topics represents a forward step, an
intensification in the Sarabande&rsquo;s narrative schemes.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">Evidently, I now assign considerably greater 
developmental significance to bars 25&ndash;28 (and to the last two phrases of the
Sarabande in general) than I did when I prepared my original article.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">Though this is common and sensible strategy, it is 
by no means mandatory for Sarabandes to close with a <i>denouement</i>; a good 
number end climactically (Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barry Lyndon&rdquo; Sarabande, from the D-minor
Suite, HWV 437, for instance, or the Sarabande from Bach&rsquo;s A-major English Suite, BWV 806).</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">It is interesting to note how the contrasting 
temporalities of the subphrases in bars 1&ndash;8 and 9&ndash;16 merge into a relatively streamlined
temporality in bars 17&ndash;32 with the abandonment, at the surface, of the
overlapping hemiolas.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">See, for instance, Jim Samson, <i>Chopin, The Four 
Ballades</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), Chapter 4, with
further references.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">Kallberg, &ldquo;The Rhetoric of Genre: Chopin&rsquo;s Nocturne 
in G Minor,&rdquo; <i>19th Century Music</i>, vol. 11, no. 3 (Spring, 1988), pages 238&ndash;61,
reprinted in Kallberg, <i>Chopin at the Boundaries: Sex, History, and
Musical Genre</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1996),
pages 3&ndash;29.</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">A valuable critique of the problems resulting from 
the application of external ideas to the analysis of this repertoire is Schulenberg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;&lsquo;Musical Allegory&rsquo; Reconsidered: Representation and Imagination in
the Baroque,&rdquo; <i>The Journal of Musicology</i>, vol. 13, no. 2 (Spring,
1995), pages 203&ndash;39.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">In several leading genres, for example, 
characteristic local fluctuations in the basic pace create durational oppositions at the
stylistic level whose extended resolution at the strategic level often
shapes the course of the entire movement.  In the concerto, these
fluctuations pit the three sections of the ritornello (<i>Vordersatz</i>, <i>Fortspinnung</i>, 
and <i>Epilog</i>) against each other at the outset; both
the ordering of solo and tutti passages later on and the internal
articulation of each solo and ritornello group typically offer
long-term narrative responses to such initial confrontations.  I
discussed this issue in some detail in &ldquo;Adjacency and Counterstress:
Applying Durational Reduction to Baroque Music,&rdquo; paper delivered at
the 1995 annual meeting of SMT in New York.</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">Elaine R. Sisman, <i>Haydn and the Classical 
Variation</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1993); Scott Burnham, 
<i>Beethoven Hero</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995).</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">As a generic piece, Handel&rsquo;s Musette resembles a 
pastorale rather
more closely than a French chaconne, <i>pace</i> Burney (see Schulenberg,
paragraph 8).  Rather than being &ldquo;predisposed against hearing
hemiolas&rdquo; here, the historically informed listener may in fact expect
them, for the Musette&rsquo;s essential materials are borrowed from the
hemiolic aria, &ldquo;Wandelt in der Liebe,&rdquo; from Telemann&rsquo;s Cantata of the
same name, no. 16 in his <i>Der Harmonische Gottesdienst</i>; see 
Ellwood
Derr, &ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Procedures for Composing with Materials from
Telemann&rsquo;s &lsquo;Harmonischer Gottes-Dienst&rsquo; [sic] in &lsquo;Solomon,&rsquo;&rdquo; 
<i>G&ouml;ttinger Handel-Beitr&auml;ge</i>, vol. 1 (Kassel: Barenreiter, 1984), page 144.  It is possible, too, that these materials are borrowed from the
hemiolic aria, &ldquo;Son confusa pastorella,&rdquo; from Handel&rsquo;s own <i>Poro</i>,
which is based on the same Telemann aria; see John H. Roberts,
&ldquo;Handel&rsquo;s Borrowings from Telemann: An Inventory,&rdquo; in the same issue
of the <i>Beitr&auml;ge</i>, page 157.  The hemiolic idiom Handel employs in 
bars 11&ndash;13 (a rather more elaborate idiom than Telemann&rsquo;s) was in fact part
of the French dance-suite style around the time the Concerti Grossi,
op. 6, were composed (1739).  Rameau used it, for instance, in bars
5&ndash;7 of the first Menuet from the Suite in G (from the <i>Nouvelles
Suites de Pieces de Clavecin</i>, 1728), and again in the Menuet&rsquo;s 
vastly
expanded solo, orchestral, and choral transcription (at &ldquo;Naissez, dons
de Flore&rdquo;) in Scene 2 of the Prologue to <i>Castor et Pollux</i> 
(1737).</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">As William Rothstein recently pointed out, the construction of
such narratives is an essential part of the interpretative process a
performer goes through.  See Rothstein, &ldquo;Analysis and the Act of
Performance,&rdquo; in John Rink, ed., <i>The Practice of Performance</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), pages 237&ndash;38.  An
influential appraisal of these issues appears in Kendall L. Walton,
&ldquo;Listening with Imagination: Is Music Representational?&rdquo; <i>The Journal
of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i>, vol. 52, no. 1 (Winter, 1994),
pages 47&ndash;61; see especially the abstracts of the papers presented at the
session devoted to &ldquo;Listening with Imagination&rdquo; during the 1995 AMS
meeting in New York.</div>
