<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[1] Introduction</b></p>
<p>[1.1] Olivier Messiaen (1908&ndash;92) distinguished himself from many of his musical 
contemporaries by his passion for sound-color relationships, which are an integral 
part of his compositional approach and unite the disparate elements of his harmonic 
language. Despite the unconventional and mimetic nature of Messiaen&rsquo;s coloristic 
musings, there are consistent subtexts that characterize his approach to sound-color 
relationships in his music. First, chords evoke color associations in Messiaen&rsquo;s 
colored-hearing synesthesia.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Second, 
Messiaen&rsquo;s color associations are very consistent. Third, the<i> simultaneous contrast</i> 
of colors, derived from the painting world, is an important compositional analogy 
that influences Messiaen&rsquo;s harmonic approach. While discussing with Claude Samuel 
how he structured a musical work, Messiaen stated that he associated specific sonorities 
with specific colors and employed them like a painter, juxtaposing colors and highlighting 
them through their complements as the composition unfolded.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Figure 1</b>. Robert Delaunay, <i>Hommage &agrave; Bl&eacute;riot (1914)</i></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="benitez_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Figure 1 thumbnail" src="benitez_fig1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[1.2] In his interviews, Messiaen consistently mentioned the work of Charles 
Blanc-Gatti (1890&ndash;1965) and Robert Delaunay (1885&ndash;1941) as significant influences 
on his compositional thinking. Messiaen admired the physiological aspects of Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s 
synesthesia and noted how the colors in five of the Swiss artist&rsquo;s paintings that 
he owned moved and interacted like sounds.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
As for Delaunay, Messiaen was impressed not only with the French painter&rsquo;s emphasis 
on color in his work but also with his use of simultaneous contrast. In fact, Messiaen 
preferred Delaunay over all other painters and declared the artist&rsquo;s work as &ldquo;very 
close to what I see when I hear music.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> 
As an example of Delaunay&rsquo;s work, let us consider <i>Hommage &agrave; </i><i>Bl&eacute;riot,</i> 
painted in 1914 (<b>Figure 1</b>). Louis Bl&eacute;riot (1872&ndash;1936) was an airplane builder 
and the first French pilot to fly across the English channel, a feat, accomplished 
on July 25, 1909, that made him a national hero in France. When viewing Delaunay&rsquo;s 
painting, we can discern airplanes, even the Eiffel Tower, but everything else is 
obscured by colored circles. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[1.3] One way Messiaen approximates simultaneous contrast in his music is to 
combine different musical layers in various ways. These compositional designs involve 
musical devices that take their cues from the use of color in abstract painting: 
by itself, a single color has no life of its own; only when it opposes other colors 
does it attain movement and expression. In an analogous fashion, when one musical 
layer opposes, for instance, another layer in a musical passage, it achieves a heightened 
sense of vibrancy through the opposition of its pitch materials, instrumental colors, 
or both with those of the other layer&rsquo;s. Similarly, the other layer is also enhanced 
by the same opposition of musical elements.</p>
<p>[1.4] In this article, a musical layer refers to either a textural layer that is 
part of a vertical density-space or a harmonic layer that suggests a hierarchy of 
structural levels. The term textural layer describes the quality of sound produced 
by its pitch content, timbre, or both.  In Messiaen&rsquo;s music, especially in his later 
works, textural layers typically feature either pitch or timbral elements due to 
his tendency to treat various musical parameters as separately composable 
elements.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> But pitch and timbre are 
also treated as closely allied in Messiaen&rsquo;s music, indeed to the extent that the 
frequency and character of a chord&rsquo;s sound become practically inseparable. In such 
cases, textural layers feature both pitch and timbral elements.</p>
<p>[1.5] The close association between pitch and timbre finds precedent in Messiaen&rsquo;s 
concept of <i>natural resonance,</i> which involves the use of notes, representing 
artificial harmonics, to enhance a given chord, resulting in the modification of 
the chord&rsquo;s timbre. As a consequence, harmony and timbre are united in natural resonance 
as chords are reconfigured sonically by timbral components. This union of harmony 
and timbre can be extended to include the relationship between a chord and its instrumental 
color (the quality of which is determined by the instrument&rsquo;s harmonic spectrum). 
The quality of a chord&rsquo;s sound may be linked equally to both the harmonic color 
arising from the chord&rsquo;s resonance elements as well as the chord&rsquo;s instrumental 
color. What emerges through this close connection between pitch and timbre is a 
single coloristic quality that is linked to the chord&rsquo;s sound. </p>
<p>[1.6] Since a textural layer embraces the elements of pitch and timbre, it can 
be interpreted from coloristic perspectives as opposing other layers in a musical 
texture. I interpret such multi-layered textures in Messiaen&rsquo;s music as arising 
from compositional schemes or, more specifically, <i>additive designs</i><sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
that are based on musical equivalents of simultaneous contrast. In an additive design, 
each layer of a musical texture is enhanced by means of its opposition to other 
layers, which intensifies the complete texture. This way of viewing 
a multi-layered musical texture differs, moreover, from a perspective involving 
stratification. In an additive design, emphasis is placed on how different layers 
of sound are combined to produce a musical texture and not on how a musical texture 
is divided into different layers of sound (as with stratification). Furthermore, 
considerable importance is placed on how different textural layers interact with 
one another, especially on how they enhance one another through pitch, timbral, 
or pitch and timbral contrast. When used in analysis, stratification leads one to 
focus more on a layer&rsquo;s content and less on its interaction with other layers in 
the musical texture. As posited in this article, I view the mutual enhancement of 
colors through simultaneous contrast in painting as influencing Messiaen&rsquo;s structuring 
of multi-layered textures in his music. Such a connection between color and music 
suggests fresh ways of approaching Messiaen&rsquo;s works that are in keeping with his 
statements about how his melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and timbres behave like colors.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[1.7] Additive designs also comprise compositional schemes that are characterized 
by the simultaneous sounding of two structurally separate harmonic layers in a musical 
passage. While these harmonic layers are hierarchical in the sense that the layer 
closest to the musical surface (hereafter foreground) contains the pitch content 
of the layer operating at a deeper level of structure (hereafter background), the 
former is not derived from the latter through techniques of prolongation. Rather, 
the layers represent two concurrent strands of harmonic activity that are woven 
together to form the passage&rsquo;s musical fabric. The pitch content of the background 
defines the structure of the passage through strategically-placed chords that function 
as referential points of arrival or departure. The pitch content of the foreground 
colors the background with its more numerous chords, even to the extent of suggesting 
motion from one referential point to another. But more strongly, the opposition 
generated by the structurally distinct harmonic layers intensifies both the chords found in each layer as well as the color associations suggested 
by them. In fact, as I shall discuss later in this article, this type of additive 
design comes closest to resembling color schemes employed in painting. </p>
<p>[1.8] In this article, I examine the additive designs employed by Messiaen in 
his opera <i>Saint </i><i>Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise</i> (1975&ndash;83) to explore how simultaneous 
contrast functions as a structural principle in his music. <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</i> 
is an ideal piece for this study, for it contains, according to Messiaen, all of 
his harmonic procedures and the colors that he envisioned for his chords.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
I begin by considering the role simultaneous contrast plays in Delaunay&rsquo;s and Messiaen&rsquo;s 
artistic outlooks. Next, I categorize Messiaen&rsquo;s additive designs to lay the groundwork 
for a discussion of their use in the Angel&rsquo;s discourse of scene 3 (<i>Le baiser 
au l&eacute;preux</i>) and music of scene 5 (<i>L&rsquo;Ange musicien</i>), two of the opera&rsquo;s 
most pivotal musical-dramatic moments. In my discussion, I focus on how Messiaen 
organizes pitch materials through the use of separate structural levels, contrasting 
harmonic types and timbres, and the structural connections and separations generated 
by simultaneous <i>pitch-timbre</i> relationships. Moreover, I consider the symbolic 
connotations suggested by each passage&#39;s sound-color harmonies and how they support 
the drama of their respective scenes.<br>

<p>[2.1] Let us now consider some basic concepts in color theory. Colors are 
usually grouped into analogous and complementary categories 
(<b>Figure 2</b>). 
Analogous colors are three or four colors that are adjacent on a color wheel, such 
as blue-green, blue, and blue-violet. Complementary colors are those hues that lie 
directly across from one another on the color wheel, such as red and green. Simultaneous 
contrast refers to the phenomenon of two colors differing in both <i>tone</i> (a 
color&rsquo;s relative degree of lightness or darkness) and hue when placed side-by-side 
. The amount of mutual enhancement depends on whether the colors are light or dark 
and analogous or complementary, with complementary colors producing the best effects. 
When the colors are complementary, they tend to brighten each other with no change 
in hue.</p>
<p>[2.2] The reciprocal enhancement of colors was first described by the nineteenth-century 
French color theorist Michel-Eug&egrave;ne Chevreul (1786&ndash;1889), who influenced many painters, 
particularly Delaunay.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Delaunay studied 
Chevreul&rsquo;s theories and those of the American color theorist Ogden N. Rood (1831&ndash;1902) 
and subsequently incorporated color contrast as a significant part of his painting 
approach.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> His goal was to produce 
a pure painting style based on the interaction of contrasting areas of color. Instead 
of rendering perceived motifs into painted form, Delaunay rebuilt them through color 
contrast. Delaunay produced a series of paintings entitled <i>Discs</i> (1912&ndash;13) 
that were based on the color wheel, works that he regarded as major experimental 
efforts later in his life.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> But 
Delaunay&rsquo;s approach to color harmony was different from Chevreul&rsquo;s in that Delaunay 
included <i>color dissonance,</i> that is, two colors that were neither analogous 
nor complementary, such as red and blue, as an expressive value within his work.</p>
<p>[2.3] For Delaunay, colors engage in a perpetual synchronous movement originating 
from simultaneous contrasts.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Termed
<i>rhythmic simultaneity</i> by the painter, this movement is brought about by the 
slow vibrations of complementary colors and the faster vibrations of dissonant colors. 
In essence, a painting perceived simultaneously features multiple dimensions due 
to its different groups of colors. These colors oppose or neutralize one another, 
and the intensity of a single color&rsquo;s vibrations is dependent on both adjacent and 
distant colors in the painting. In sum, colors for Delaunay, as Max Imhdahl puts 
it, &ldquo;play to and away from each other, now clashing and now harmonizing, catch and 
synchronize various actions in a kind of steady and unceasing simultaneity of systole 
and diastole.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> These optical oscillations, 
moreover, are not mechanical sequences but continuous motions and therefore reflective 
of real movement. Delaunay viewed such synchronous movements as representative of 
a philosophical universality in which the eye experiences the vital movement of 
the universe as a simultaneous action of separation and reunion. </p>

<p>[2.4] <b>Figure 3</b>, 
a reproduction of Delaunay&rsquo;s <i>Formes circulaires. Soleil n<sup>o</sup> 1</i> (1912&ndash;13), 
can be used to illustrate how rhythmic simultaneity functions in his approach to 
painting. Blue and orange are complementary colors that face each other across the 
circle. The complementary colors of red and green balance the opposition of blue 
and orange by their placement at opposite sides within the circle. The central yellow 
combines with the purple below it to form a near-complementary relationship. The 
dissonant colors of red and blue and orange and green separate themselves from the 
aforementioned complementary colors by their faster vibrations. In short, there 
are multiple color relationships occurring simultaneously.</p>
<p>[2.5] As evident from different sources, Messiaen demonstrated some knowledge of 
color theory.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> He described the 
phenomenon of simultaneous contrast and pointed to its basis in scientific research, 
stating that the &ldquo;eye manufactured complements before painters discovered them.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
But more significantly, Messiaen asserted that simultaneous contrast and its musical 
counterpart, natural resonance, form two key elements of his approach to composition. 
Both stem from natural phenomena, one by means of the interaction of two colors 
placed side-by-side and the other from the resonance of a sounding body. Furthermore, 
Messiaen&rsquo;s use of natural resonance, which involves adding artificial harmonics 
to a given chord to modify its timbre, suggests an analogy with the complementary 
fringe effects produced by staring at a colored circle mounted on a white background. 
When one stares at such a colored circle, one will see the color&rsquo;s complement forming 
a halo around the circle&rsquo;s perimeter. In Messiaen&rsquo;s music, resonance elements can 
be considered as musical counterparts to these fringe effects in that they at times 
will generate (according to Messiaen) coloristic glows or halos above or below the 
chords to which they are added.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.6] For Messiaen, because simultaneous contrast<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
affects the sense of vision and natural resonance the sense of hearing, they are 
interconnected phenomena. In other words, they integrate vision and hearing in 
his 
musical world. Indeed, this integration of vision and hearing is a significant element 
of Messiaen&rsquo;s discussions about the role of color in his music, more important, 
in fact, than the identification of a chord&rsquo;s color association. In Messiaen&rsquo;s 
view, when someone listens to his music, it is more important that the superior 
senses of vision and hearing be connected in a manner analogous to the inferior 
senses of smell and taste; it is less important to see the same colors as he 
does. For him, when a person&rsquo;s vision and hearing are united, that person 
perceives a colored music that is dazzling in its effect and scope, a musical 
analogue, if you will, to the coloristic effects produced by medieval 
stained-glass windows.</p>

<p>[3.1] Before discussing the additive designs of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois,</i> I shall explain 
the construction of the pitch collections developed by Messiaen that will be mentioned 
in my article (Examples 1&ndash;6). Messiaen&rsquo;s harmonic vocabulary can be divided into 
modal and non-modal categories. The <i>modes of limited transposition</i> form the 
modal category and are shown in <b>Example 1</b>. The modes are seven 
symmetrical pitch collections that reproduce their original contents after being 
transposed a given number of times. This reduces the number of distinct 
transpositional levels from twelve to some smaller value. Mode 1 is the whole-tone collection (set 
class 6-35 [0,2,4,6,8,10],<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> mode 
2 is the octatonic collection (set class 8-28 [0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10]), and mode 3 
is a nine-note collection, set class 9-12 [0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10].<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.2] The <i>chords of transposed inversions on the same bass note, chords of 
contracted resonance,</i> and <i>turning chords</i> belong to the non-modal category. 
As shown in Examples 2&ndash;5, the 
chords of transposed inversions and the chords of contracted resonance arise from 
the modification of a dominant-ninth chord (V<sup>9</sup>) by appoggiaturas.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> The chords of 
transposed inversions consist of four different seven-note chords that are generated 
by replacing the third of a V<sup>9</sup> chord with its chromatic upper neighbor and by 
adding two appoggiaturas above the modified V<sup>9</sup> chord (<b>Example 2</b>). The altered V<sup>9</sup> chord is then 
cycled through three of its four inversions, with the appoggiaturas kept registrally 
above the V<sup>9</sup> in two of the three inversions. Each inverted form is then transposed 
to begin on the same bass note as the chord&rsquo;s root-position form (<b>Example 3</b>). The chords of transposed inversions 
on the same bass note are all members of set class 7-20 [0,1,2,5,6,7,9]. </p>
<p>[3.3] The chords of contracted resonance consist of two seven-note chords that 
are produced by replacing the third of a V<sup>9</sup> chord with its chromatic upper neighbor 
(<b>Example 4</b>). 
The V<sup>9</sup> chord is then arranged in second inversion. Two notes representing <i>inferior 
resonance</i><sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> are placed one octave 
and a tritone and two octaves and a minor sixth below the bass note of the altered 
V<sup>9</sup> chord. This chord is preceded by a sonority consisting of five appoggiaturas 
and the same two notes of inferior resonance (not shown in Example 4). In resolving 
to the altered V<sup>9</sup> chord, four appoggiaturas move by step whereas one ascends a 
major third. These two chords, members of set classes 7-Z36 [0,1,2,3,5,6,8] and 
7-Z12 [0,1,2,3,4,7,9], respectively, are then rearranged registrally in the most 
compact way possible to reflect the &ldquo;contracted&rdquo; nature of their label (<b>Example 
5</b>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>[3.4] Turning chords involve a group of three eight-note harmonies that produces 
a single complex of sound-colors. The complex is generated through the changing 
pitch and color contents brought about by the succession of the chords (<b>Example 
6</b>). 
Messiaen compared the coloristic effects of turning chords to a translucent, opaline 
octahedron, or, more simply, rainbow-colored glass.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> 
Each face of the octahedron has three possible variations of colored light that 
correspond collectively to three combinations of eight notes, which equal the twenty-four 
notes of the three turning chords. Through their succession, turning chords 
suggest a single column of sound-colors that &ldquo;turns&rdquo; while changing. According to Messiaen, a person who experiences a group of turning chords recalls only the cumulative 
effects of their succession (&ldquo;le fruit des 3 accords&rdquo;): a single complex of sound-colors 
dominated by one hue. Finally, the three harmonies constituting a turning-chord 
group are members of set classes 8-5 [0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8], 8-4 [0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8], and 
8-14 [0,1,2,4,5,6,7,9].</p>
<p>[3.5] Non-modal chords suggest a wider variety of color associations than the 
modes of limited transposition because of Messiaen&rsquo;s assignment of a unique set 
of colors to each of their twelve possible transpositions.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
The more numerous color associations brought about by twelve available transpositions 
allow Messiaen more freedom to color his musical passages with a greater variety 
of sound-color harmonies. As for the modes, they suggest fewer color associations 
because of their inherent transpositional restrictions. Messiaen assigns one dominant 
color or set of colors to each transposition of a mode. Since chords representing 
a specific modal transposition will suggest the same transposition again after being 
transposed either upward or downward by three, four, or six semitones, the modes 
do not evoke the same level of coloristic variety as that evoked by non-modal sonorities. 
The number of potential modal color associations is reduced, furthermore, by Messiaen&rsquo;s 
favoring of modes 2, 3, 4 , and 6, which are the only modes for which he provides 
color associations,<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> over modes 
1, 5, and 7 in his music. Indeed, this number is reduced additionally by Messiaen&rsquo;s 
favoring of modes 2 and 3 over modes 4 and 6.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> 
In sum, the reduction in both the number of modes and transpositional levels used 
indicates an even greater difference between the variety of color associations suggested 
by the modes and that suggested by non-modal sonorities.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[4] The Additive Designs of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise</i> and Two Introductory 
Examples</b></p>
<p>[4.1] I group the additive designs of <i>Saint Francois</i> into three categories: 
(1) <i>contrasting </i><i>additive designs,</i> (2) <i>analogous additive designs,</i> 
and (3) <i>compound additive designs</i>. Contrasting additive designs include two 
simultaneous textural layers that emphasize an opposition of either pitch materials 
or pitch and timbre. I borrow the term &ldquo;contrasting&rdquo; from color theory to characterize 
the resemblance of this type of design to the combination of complementary colors 
(color opposites) in painting.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> 
Like the simultaneous contrast of complementary colors, the musical contents of 
the two layers derive a more heightened intensity and expression when they oppose 
one another in musical passages. Analogous additive designs arise from the combination 
of two structurally separate harmonic layers that are governed by actual analogous-color 
relationships. More specifically, a background harmonic structure, normally a tonality, 
is enhanced by foreground pitch collections in conformity with the analogous-color 
scheme created by their respective color associations. Accordingly, I borrow the 
term &ldquo;analogous&rdquo; from color theory to describe the design&rsquo;s resemblance to the combination 
of hues in an analogous-color scheme in which a dominant color (represented by the 
tonality) is enhanced by its immediate neighbors (represented by foreground pitch 
collections) on the color wheel through simultaneous contrast.</p>
<p>[4.2] Compound additive designs are composed of several simultaneous textural 
layers that produce chromatically saturated pitch spaces. Because of this saturation, 
it is extremely difficult to perceive each layer&rsquo;s pitch content.<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> 
But if we consider the pitch materials of each layer as merging with their associated 
timbres<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> to form pitch-timbres 
and how these pitch-timbres are connected or separated simultaneously, then a sense 
of shape emerges in a compound additive design. These simultaneous relationships 
suggest, moreover, parallels with Delaunay&rsquo;s concept of rhythmic simultaneity, which 
describes the pervasive synchronous movement of optical vibrations generated by 
the juxtaposition of complementary and dissonant colors in painting. Pitch-timbres 
dwell in a self-contained sound space and mimic the rhythmic simultaneity of colors 
through musical relationships based on similarities or dissimilarities in pitch, 
timbre, or both. For example, two layers may be connected to each other by being 
linked with members of the same instrumental family, such as the violins and violas, 
and with similar pitch collections, such as modes 1 and 3.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> 
They may diverge simultaneously from a third layer that is linked with a different 
instrumental family, such as the woodwinds, and different pitch collections, such 
as a series of chords of transposed inversions. Thus, through various connections 
and separations, pitch-timbres exhibit varying degrees of integration and disassociation 
in compound additive designs, displaying, more often than not, high levels of disassociation.

<p>[4.3] Before turning to the Angel&rsquo;s discourse in <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux</i> 
and music in <i>L&rsquo;Ange </i><i>musicien</i> in which analogous and compound additive 
designs will be discussed, respectively, let us consider two examples of contrasting 
additive designs in <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</i>. <b>Example 7</b> illustrates a contrasting additive 
design composed of two textural layers that are pitch-class complements of one another. 
The example is taken from the third strophe of Brother Masseo&rsquo;s ornithology lesson 
in scene 6, <i>Le Pr&#xEA;che aux oiseaux.</i><sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> 
Messiaen acknowledged this use of pitch-class complementation as a type of simultaneously 
contrast derived from Delaunay in an interview with Almut R&ouml;ssler: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed during the replaying [of] some of my works, that I&rsquo;d unintentionally 
  employed the well[-]known phenomenon of complementary colours, called &lsquo;simultaneous 
  contrasts&rsquo; in the painting world, and used most of all by Delaunay. An example: 
  if I have a chord made up of seven notes, one also hears the other five which 
  are missing–played by other instruments or in another register.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup>  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[4.4] In Example 7, 
Brother Masseo&rsquo;s melodic line is supported initially by chords drawn from mode 2:1 
&lt;0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10&gt;<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> and a chord 
of transposed inversions on A (first inversion, represented by CTI<sub>1</sub>/A {0,1,2,5,6,7,9}). 
The harmonic support moves to a series of turning chords followed by three statements 
of an eight-note chord, set class 8-16 [0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9]. Beginning with the last 
turning chord, 8-14 {8,10,11,0,1,3,4,5}, and proceeding through the three transpositions 
of 8-16, Messiaen employs a contrasting textural layer composed of the literal pitch-class 
complements of these chords.</p>


<p>[4.5] The aggregates formed by the combination of these two layers can be analyzed 
as <i>chords of total chromaticism</i>. This non-modal chord type is often realized 
as either eight- and four-note or seven- and five-note harmonies that are literal 
pitch-class complements of one another. <b>Example 8</b> shows an analytical reduction 
of a chord of total chromaticism taken from Saint Francis&rsquo;s dream of New Caledonia 
in <i>Le Pr&#xEA;che aux oiseaux</i>.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> 
The chord consists of three superimposed triadic harmonies with added notes. The 
two bottom harmonies form set class 8-16 {3,4,5,6,8,10,11,0}, while the top harmony 
forms 4-16 {7,9,1,2}, the literal pitch-class complement of the eight-note sonority 
below. This chord of total chromaticism not only matches the registral distribution 
of the last three aggregates of Example 7 but also is similar in timbral 
make-up–all of these chords are sounded primarily by strings, horns, bassoons, flutes, 
and piccolos. But identifying the chord type that the aggregates of Example 7 might 
arise from is not pertinent here; rather, the focus should be on how these aggregates 
are generated. In other words, why does Messiaen combine two distinct textural layers 
that are not only literal pitch-class complements of one another but also sounded 
by different instrumental families (strings, horns, and bassoons vs. flutes and 
piccolos)? As evinced in the R&ouml;ssler interview, I believe that these aggregates 
result from Messiaen&rsquo;s use of simultaneous contrast. On a canvas, a painter enhances 
a given color (e.g., red) by juxtaposing it with its complement (e.g., green), resulting 
in complementary afterglows around each color. In Example 7&rsquo;s contrasting additive 
design, the four-note chords in the top layer can be viewed as musical analogues 
to such complementary afterglows. Each of these chords intensifies the &ldquo;chroma&rdquo; 
of its respective eight-note chord in the bottom layer through pitch-class complementation 
and contrasting timbres.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[4.6] <b>Example 9</b> 
shows a contrasting additive design composed of two active parts that is taken from 
the avian commentary on &ldquo;perfect joy&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> 
in scene 1, <i>La Croix</i> (R66:1&ndash;R73:11). The skylark II&rsquo;s harmonic support is 
distinguished by non-modal and modal pitch collections. The chords of transposed 
inversions govern the bird&rsquo;s flourishes with chords drawn from mode 3:3 &lt;2,4,5,6,8, 
9,10,0,1&gt; serving as harmonic foil. A chord of transposed inversions on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
(first inversion, CTI<sub>1</sub>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> {4,5,6,9,10,11,1}), the 
passage&rsquo;s concluding chord, gives harmonic focus to the bird&rsquo;s chordal support, 
which includes other chords of transposed inversions (CTI<sub>1</sub>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> 
{6,7,8,11,0,1,3}, CTI<sub>1</sub>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> {1,2,3,6,7,8,10}, CTI<sub>1</sub>/D 
{5,6,7,10,11,0,2}) that alternate with subsets from mode 3:3 (6-14 {1,4,5,6,8,9}, 
6-15 {6,9,10,0,1,2}).<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> The harmonic 
content of the passage is indicative, furthermore, of the skylark II&rsquo;s music throughout 
the commentary. Chords of transposed inversions (especially the CTI<sub>1</sub>/<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>) 
and, to a lesser extent, chords of contracted resonance (7-Z36 [0,1,2,3,5,6,8], 
7-Z12 [0,1,2,3,4,7,9]) play important roles in defining the bird&rsquo;s flourishes. Mode 
3:3 along with mode 3:2 &lt;1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,0&gt; continues to serve as harmonic contrast 
to these chords. These modes are consistently represented by their subsets 6-14 
[0,1,3,4,5,8], 6-15 [0,1,2,4,5,8], and 6-21 [0,2,3,4,6,8].</p>
<p>[4.7] The skylark I&rsquo;s harmonic support consists of trichords drawn primarily 
from set classes 3-1 [0,1,2], 3-4 [0,1,5], and 3-5 [0,1,6]. These trichords, moreover, 
are realized with wide interval spacings in pitch space. These chords distinguish 
themselves from the larger and more tertian-sounding chords found in the skylark 
II&rsquo;s music. In addition, the skylark I&rsquo;s musical modules are shorter than their 
counterpart&rsquo;s, which intensifies the harmonic differences between the two pitch 
schemes. For example, 3-4 initiates three of the bird&rsquo;s gestures in the same amount 
of time taken up by one gesture in the skylark II&rsquo;s music. But in a certain sense, 
this is a logical consequence of the skylark I&rsquo;s more static harmonic content, for 
its modules must proceed at a faster rate to balance the slower but more harmonically 
varied modules of the skylark II. Finally, like the skylark II&rsquo;s music, the harmonic 
content of the passage is fairly indicative of the skylark I&rsquo;s music throughout 
the commentary. </p>

<p>[4.8] The two simultaneous textural layers of Example 9 exhibit not only more internal 
harmonic contrast than Example 7 but more timbral contrast as well: 
the skylark I&rsquo;s music is played by the xylos<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> 
and the skylark II&rsquo;s music by the woodwinds. As shown in <b>Figure 4</b>, this timbral contrast was accentuated 
spatially by Messiaen in the 1983 performances of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</i> in Paris.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> 
Messiaen had twenty-two woodwinds placed on a platform to the left of the stage 
and five mallet percussion instruments, which included the xylo ensemble, on a platform 
to the right of the stage. According to Messiaen, such an arrangement favored these 
two ensembles but minimized the strings.<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[5] Analogous Additive Design: The Angel&rsquo;s Discourse, <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux</i></b></p>
<p>[5.1] Let us now study the analogous additive design used in the Angel&rsquo;s discourse 
from <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux</i> (scene 3). The Angel&rsquo;s discourse is one of the 
most dramatic passages of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</i>. Indeed, Messiaen considered the 
words spoken by the Angel in scene 3 to be one of the opera&rsquo;s most important texts.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> 
Reflecting God&rsquo;s intervention in the situation involving Saint Francis and the Leper,<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> 
the Angel appears behind a window and addresses the Leper with words adapted from 
1 John 3:20: &ldquo;Leper, your heart accuses you. But God is greater than your heart. 
He is Love, He is greater than your heart, He knows all. But God is all Love, and 
he who abides in Love abides in God, and God in him&rdquo; (&ldquo;L&eacute;preux, ton coeur t&rsquo;accuse. 
Mais Dieu est plus grand que ton coeur. Il est Amour, Il est plus grand que ton 
coeur, Il conna&#xEE;t tout. Mais Dieu est tout Amour, et qui demeure dans l&rsquo;Amour demeure 
en Dieu, et Dieu en lui.&rdquo;).</p>


<p>[5.2] The tonality of A major constitutes the music&rsquo;s background design 
(<b>Figure 5</b>). 
It is the musical analogue to the dominant color of an analogous-color scheme. In 
strophes 1, 2, and 4, A major is asserted by a first-inversion A-major triad that 
begins and ends each strophe. In strophe 3, Messiaen varies this background design 
by cadencing on an EMm<img border="0" alt="4 3" src="../../gifs/43.gif" width="7" height="17" style="vertical-align:text-top"> chord, A major&rsquo;s dominant, producing 
an open harmonic movement that achieves closure in strophe 4.</p>
<p>[5.3] The music&rsquo;s foreground pitch collections are drawn chiefly from the second 
and third modes of limited transposition. These modes are the musical analogues 
to the subordinate colors that enhance the dominant color of an analogous-color 
scheme through simultaneous contrast. They are suggested by characteristic subsets 
and are positioned within the larger harmonic area of A major. In each strophe, 
modal subsets often combine to form a larger subset that is one note short of its 
parent scale. In strophes 1 and 2, which are virtually alike, subsets from modes 
3:2 &lt;1,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,0&gt; and 3:3 &lt;2,4,5,6,8,9,10,0,1&gt; are juxtaposed to represent 
their respective parent collections (<b>Example 10</b>). After the opening A-major chord, 
Messiaen suggests mode 3:2 by inserting a characteristic subset, 6-15 {9,0,1,3,4,5}, 
into the passage. These two chords alternate before giving way to another modal 
subset, 6-21 {11,1,3,4,5,7}. At this point, Messiaen transforms 6-15 and 6-21 by 
a T<sub>5</sub> operation, engendering a move to mode 3:3 and a different harmonic area.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup> 
In both cases, these modal subsets result in 8-24 [0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10], a larger subset 
that is one note short of its mode 3 scale [0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10]. </p>
<p>[5.4] Strophe 3 differs from previous strophes as mode 2:1 &lt;0,1,3,4,6,7,9,10&gt; 
is suggested by subsets 3-11 [0,3,7], 4-26 [0,3,5,8], and 4-Z29 [0,1,3,7] (<b>Example 
11</b>). 
A four-chord succession consisting of three members of set class 4-Z29 followed 
by 3-11, the discourse&rsquo;s A-major chord, begins the strophe. The drive to each A-major 
chord in the succession, moreover, serves to polarize A major within the mode as 
well as to reinforce A major as the strophe&rsquo;s tonality. At the end of the strophe, 
4-26 and two members of 4-Z29 combine to form 7-31 [0,1,3,4,6,7,9], the octatonic 
heptachord, which reestablishes mode 2:1&rsquo;s harmonic priority before the strophe&rsquo;s 
conclusion on the dominant of A major.</p>
<p>[5.5] The mode 2:1 harmonic area, labeled A in Example 11, is followed by a contrasting 
harmonic area labeled B. Consisting primarily of the chords of contracted resonance 
and chords of transposed inversions, area B heightens the harmonic differences between 
strophe 3 and strophes 1 and 2. As mentioned above, the mode 2:1 harmonic area (A) 
returns before the strophe concludes on the dominant of A major. By enclosing these 
two non-modal chord types, mode 2:1 asserts itself as the more consequential foreground 
pitch collection of strophe 3. </p>
<p>[5.6] (Strophe 4 [R72:1&ndash;24] is an expanded version of strophes 1 and 2. The only 
tangible difference between it and the music&rsquo;s previous strophes is the inclusion 
[beginning at R72:12] of a succession of chords of transposed inversions that is 
followed by two chords suggesting mode 3:3 {1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10}.) </p>
<p>[5.7] Despite the presence of other pitch structures, modes 2 and 3 are the featured 
foreground pitch collections in the Angel&rsquo;s music depicted in Examples 10 and 11. Among the transpositional levels 
of these modes, only 2:1, 3:2, and 3:3 contain A-major triads, thus their inclusion 
in the Angel&rsquo;s music is conditioned at first glance by the common tones they share 
with the tonality of A major. But more strongly, an analogous-color scheme connects 
these modes to A major when all of their colors are combined. For Messiaen, the 
key of A major is blue because its tonic triad, an A-major chord, suggests the same 
color in his synesthesia.<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> In the 
Angel&rsquo;s discourse, Messiaen chooses those modes whose color associations harmonize 
with the blue of A major. With the exception of gray, a color associated with mode 
3:2, the blue-violet of mode 2:1, the mauve of 3:2, and the blue and green of 3:3 
neighbor the blue of A major when considered on a color wheel. For its part, gray 
merges easily with this color scheme through its characteristic absorption of the 
strengths of its neighboring colors. Thus, through the simultaneous contrast of 
analogous colors, these modes enhance the tonality of A major from a sound-color 
perspective.</p>
<p>[5.8] The colors in the Angel&rsquo;s discourse suggest psychological connotations 
based on color perception and symbolism. Blue, blue-violet, green, and mauve reflect 
the cool side of the color spectrum and allude to the uniform, perhaps calm, nature 
of the Angel&rsquo;s message to the Leper. Because of the symbolic connotations of blue, 
A major, in its role as the discourse&rsquo;s tonality, reinforces the Angel&rsquo;s theological 
message about the truth of heavenly love. In Christian color symbolism, blue represents 
heaven and heavenly love because it is the color of the sky. It is also associated 
with truth because, as George Ferguson states, &ldquo;blue always appears in the sky after 
the clouds are dispelled, suggesting the unveiling of truth.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup>While discussing color symbolism with Claude Samuel in 1967, Messiaen alluded to 
hyacinth, a bluish violet, as representing the truth of love in medieval color symbolism.<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> 
Thus, I interpret A major&rsquo;s association with the Angel&rsquo;s music in scene 3 as representing 
the truth of heavenly love in the opera&rsquo;s dramatic design. <br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[6] Compound Additive Design: The Angel&rsquo;s Music, <i>L&rsquo;Ange musicien</i></b></p>
<p>[6.1] Let us now consider the compound additive design associated with the Angel&rsquo;s 
music in scene 5. In <i>L&rsquo;Ange musicien,</i> Saint Francis is visited by the Angel, 
who paraphrases a passage from Saint Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s <i>Summa Theologiae</i> regarding 
God and the nature of truth: &ldquo;God dazzles us by an excess of Truth. Music carries 
us to God by an absence of Truth&rdquo; (&ldquo;Dieu nous &eacute;blouit par exc&egrave;s de V&eacute;rit&eacute;. La musique 
nous porte &agrave; Dieu par d&eacute;faut de V&eacute;rit&eacute;.&rdquo;).<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> 
The Angel plays celestial music for Saint Francis, which allows the friar to experience 
the foretaste of heavenly joy that he had prayed for earlier in the scene.</p>
<p>[6.2] The design&rsquo;s pitch-timbres suggest simultaneous connections and separations 
based on their relationships to C major, which is the tonality of the Angel&rsquo;s music 
and the design&rsquo;s center of gravity. C major is established immediately prior to 
the sounding of this compound additive design by a prolonged second-inversion C-major 
triad when the Angel first plays its melody (R86:1&ndash;R87:4). As with A major, the 
key of C major connotes white in Messiaen&rsquo;s synesthesia because its tonic triad 
also suggests white. Since white connotes holiness and purity in Christian color 
symbolism,<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup> I interpret the key 
of C major as representing the goal of Saint Francis&rsquo;s progression of faith, which 
is defined by the fullness of grace, that is, complete holiness and purity, in his 
soul. Through its use in the Angel&rsquo;s music, C major not only suggests the celestial 
joy that Saint Francis had asked for earlier in the scene but also connects <i>L&rsquo;Ange
</i><i>musicien</i> theologically to <i>La mort et la nouvelle vie,</i> the opera&rsquo;s 
last scene, which ends in C major. In this last scene, Saint Francis has reached 
the end of his spiritual journey. He prepares for his death and resurrection, anticipating 
the abundant grace and joy that he will experience in heaven. </p>

<p>[6.3] In <b>Example 12</b>, 
I have identified eight pitch schemes and numbered them 1 through 8.<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> 
The strings feature three designs that involve  modes 2 and 3 and connections 
to C major. As the Angel&rsquo;s melody is sounded by three Ondes Martenot playing glissandos 
back and forth from C3 to C7, the first violins in design 1 play an ostinato of 
twelve chords in mode 3:1, while the violas in design 2 play eleven chords in mode 
2:1. Each ostinato begins with a C-major chord and thus makes a connection to the 
Angel&rsquo;s tonality. A melodic ostinato in mode 2:1 played by part of the cellos in 
design 3 starts later and runs its own course. Like its counterparts that display 
connections to C major, the ostinato begins and ends on pitch-class C.</p>
<p>[6.4] The flutes, clarinets, and xylos play pitch schemes (4-6) that are associated 
with the songs of the blackbird, robin, and nightingale, respectively. As shown 
in <b>Example 13</b>, 
the blackbird&rsquo;s song in scheme 4 is supported chiefly by pitch collections that 
are connected to C major through the placement of artificial harmonics above and 
below a C-major chord. But these pitch collections also suggest mode 3:1, which 
links the bird&rsquo;s song to the music of the violins I. Unlike the blackbird&rsquo;s song, 
the songs of the robin and nightingale in schemes 5 and 6 are not connected to C 
major or the modes of limited transposition–the robin&rsquo;s music is supported primarily 
by tetrachords that are subsets of the diatonic collection [0,1,3,5,6,8,10], and 
the nightingale&rsquo;s music is supported by trichords that suggest a chromatic harmonic 
field {8,10,11,0,1,2,3,4,5}. </p>
<p>[6.5] Both transpositions of mode 1 are also included in this compound additive 
design. In scheme 7, horns 1 and 3, doubled later by the English horn, bassoon 1, 
and tubular bells, sound dyads that establish mode 1:1, the whole-tone collection 
on C &lt;0,2,4,6,8,10&gt;. Later in the passage, scheme 7 includes C as a prominent note 
in its part, hence connecting its pitch materials to C major (see R89:5, 12&ndash;16). 
In scheme 8, the cellos and double basses play a scalar form of set class 7-33 {11,0,1,3,5,7,9}, 
a whole-tone superset, which is really mode 1:2 &lt;1,3,5,7,9,11&gt;, the whole-tone collection 
on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, with pitch-class C placed initially at both ends. 
This strand complements the mode 1:1 strand and likewise exhibits connections to 
C major through pitch-class C. </p>
<p>[6.6] The eight pitch schemes produce a predominantly whole-tone pitch space 
spanning C1 to G3 and a chromatically saturated pitch space from <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>3 
to B7. Connecting both spaces is another&mdash;from C3 to C7&mdash;outlined by the Angel&rsquo;s melody 
on the Ondes Martenot. Thus, there are three overlapping pitch spaces that feature 
different pitch-timbres. As I alluded to previously, the Angel&rsquo;s melody and tonality 
of C major are the design&rsquo;s center of gravity. Pitch-timbres give shape to the congested 
upper pitch space through a series of oppositions that are based on their relationships 
to C major, their similar or dissimilar timbres, and whether or not they are related 
to the modes of limited transposition. These pitch-timbres also interact with those 
of the lower pitch space based on the same considerations. </p>
<p>[6.7] The upper pitch space exhibits more activity than the lower due to its concentrated 
mixing of woodwind, percussion, horn, and string pitch-timbres. Within this space, 
the woodwind and xylo pitch-timbres, aside from their obvious differences in instrumental 
color, contrast collectively with the more homogeneous string pitch-timbres. While 
the blackbird&rsquo;s C-major-based chords bear abstract connections with the diatonic 
collections of the robin&rsquo;s song, these relationships are not as close as those exhibited 
by, for example, the violas and cellos that share mode 2:1 and connections to C 
major. The songs of both birds, moreover, contrast with the chromatic pitch field 
and timbre of the nightingale. Since the birds&rsquo; pitch-timbres not only exhibit differences 
as a group but also tenuous connections to C major and the modes, they separate 
themselves from the more closely-related pitch-timbres of the strings.</p>
<p>[6.8] The timbres that merge with mode 1:1 (English horn, bassoon 1, horns 1 
and 3, and tubular bells) display diverse relationships with the foregoing pitch-timbres. 
They are connected to string pitch-timbres through their pitch associations (mode 
1:1 and C major) but distance themselves through timbral associations. On the other 
hand, they are closer to the woodwind and xylo pitch-timbres from timbral perspectives 
but more distant from pitch perspectives (clarinets and xylos).</p>
<p>[6.9] All of the previous pitch-timbres exhibit relationships with pitch-timbres 
active in the whole-tone pitch space. Since they include cellos, double basses, 
and bassoons 2 and 3, the lower space&rsquo;s pitch-timbres intersect coloristically with 
the upper space&rsquo;s instrumental families. Their mode 1:2 coupling and connection 
to C major, furthermore, distance them from the pitch contents of the robin and 
nightingale, connect them with that of the blackbird and the strings, and link them 
closely with the mode 1:1 strand of the horns and lower woodwinds. Since they are 
mode 1:1&rsquo;s complement and, when combined together, form the aggregate, the mode 
1:2 pitch-timbres both oppose as well as complete their modal counterpart.<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">

<p>[6.10] The passage&rsquo;s large-scale context lies rooted in a harmonic duality involving 
C major. Through their connections to C major, pitch-timbres in the upper and lower 
pitch spaces reinforce the central pitch space&rsquo;s tonality and symbolic importance. 
On the other hand, pitch-timbres not connected to C major balance the emphasis on 
the design&rsquo;s center of gravity. In sum, this compound additive design, unlike many 
others in <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois,</i> exhibits more integration than disassociation among 
its pitch-timbres. Different pitch-timbres link up with one another to form various 
strands of musical continuity that lend shape to the Angel&rsquo;s music.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup></p>
<p>[6.11] <b>Figure 6</b> summarizes the foregoing discussion.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[7] Conclusion</b></p>
<p>[7.1] In this article, I have considered how simultaneous contrast functions as 
a structural principle in Messiaen&rsquo;s music by exploring the additive designs of
<i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise.</i> I have argued for analogies between a painter&rsquo;s 
use of color and Messiaen&rsquo;s use of musical layers involving pitch and timbre. By 
studying Messiaen&rsquo;s musical materials from coloristic perspectives, especially those 
involving contrast, I believe that we can increase our understanding about their 
combination, interaction, and movement. Focusing on a single chord and color association 
is to focus on an amorphous entity. Messiaen&rsquo;s chords and colors, as well as other 
musical elements, achieve movement and expression through oppositions rooted in 
simultaneous contrast.</p>
<p>[7.2] My approach to sound-color relationships differs from the work of other 
scholars who have written on the subject of Messiaen and color. While my approach 
emphasizes simultaneous contrast and includes musical applications that encompass 
pitch, timbre, or both with general connections to color, other scholars have either 
(1) attempted to access Messiaen&rsquo;s synesthetic responses to understand how he structures 
his music or (2) explored general correspondences between color complements and 
his harmonic practice.<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> While Messiaen&rsquo;s 
synesthesia drives his compositional approach, we should not assume that analytical 
approaches to the role of color in his music have to be driven by perspectives derived 
from neuropsychology, or, for that matter, comparisons with Scriabin. Rather, sound-color 
relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s music should be viewed from the perspective of simultaneous 
contrast. As I stated at the outset of this article, Messiaen compared the way he 
structures his music to the way a painter structures colors on a canvas (see paragraph 
1.1). Both of their approaches to color involve the mutual enhancement of their 
materials through simultaneous contrast; the distinctive characteristics associated 
with a particular musical entity or color are secondary considerations. In other 
words, a painter juxtaposes two complementary colors on a canvas because they intensify 
one another to an appreciable degree, not because they lie directly opposite one 
another on a color wheel. Similarly, Messiaen combines, for example, two chords 
in his music because they enhance one another from sound-color perspectives, not 
because both chords define larger harmonic areas or happen to be literal pitch-class 
complements that form an aggregate. Aggregates and larger harmonic areas should 
be viewed as by-products of Messiaen&rsquo;s more fundamental use of simultaneous contrast 
and not as fundamental constructs that determine harmonic activity on the musical 
surface.</p>
<p>[7.3] Since simultaneous contrast plays an important role in Messiaen&rsquo;s musical 
thinking,<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> I believe when analyzing 
his music that we should focus on the ways in which it is manifested in his works. 
The examples offered in this article are but a few of many possible applications 
to the composer&rsquo;s music. For example, many of Messiaen&rsquo;s harmonic structures, particularly 
his non-modal ones, consist of either a tertian structure that is enhanced by artificial 
harmonics or two superimposed tertian structures.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup> 
In either case there is an interaction between two opposing elements, with each 
element assigned one color or a set of colors. One element will either be absorbed 
by the other element, resulting in its dominance by the other element in terms of 
both sound and color, or there will be a balanced interplay between the two elements, 
producing a harmonic structure that derives its sonic intensity from the interference 
of two equally competing but different harmonic spectra.</p>
<p>[7.4] Examining the ways in which the connection between vision and hearing 
is expressed in Messiaen&rsquo;s music is essential when trying to grasp his 
compositional designs. It is through this connection that Messiaen creates his 
music, which gives him an indication of what it would be like to experience his 
conception of eternity where a person&rsquo;s senses of vision and hearing will be 
united, not separated. While I regard the composer&rsquo;s colored-hearing synesthesia 
to be real and not the product of a bizarre temperament, I view Messiaen&rsquo;s 
descriptions of his sound-color harmonies from more distant vantage points when 
considering his compositional designs. Assigning precise musical correlations to 
Messiaen&rsquo;s statements about the colors of his chords may prove to be an 
impossible task because of the personal nature of his synesthesia. Although we 
will certainly find correlations between the composer&rsquo;s harmonies and color 
associations, these correlations will ultimately be inexact and hence reflect 
sound-color relationships in broad terms.<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> 
Sound-color relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s music are based on the connection 
between vision and hearing, represented in his compositional aesthetic by 
simultaneous contrast and its counterpart in music, the natural resonance of 
vibrating bodies. Whether by the interaction of one sound-color harmony with 
another, or by interactions involving different musical parameters, simultaneous 
contrast is connected to the process of transformation, enjoyed most by Messiaen 
as a composer.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup> Thus, to 
increase our understanding of how Messiaen structures his music, we should focus 
on the various ways he transforms his musical materials, particularly on the 
ways dynamic relationships are generated by his use of simultaneous contrast.</p>

that his peculiar brand of colored-hearing synesthesia responded to chords, not 
isolated pitches (see Olivier Messiaen, <i>Conf&eacute;rence</i> <i>de Notre-Dame: Prononc&eacute;e 
&agrave; Notre-Dame de Paris le 4 d&eacute;cembre 1977</i> [Paris: Alphonse Leduc, 1978], 10). 
This does not mean, however, that a single pitch cannot affect the color association 
of the chord in which it functions as either a member or an added note. Indeed, 
a single pitch frequently adds another color to its parent chord by its doubling 
in a higher octave register or by its placement as an added note at the top of the 
chord. See Messiaen&rsquo;s analysis of a musical passage associated with the blackcap 
in <i>Le Pr&ecirc;che aux oiseaux,</i> scene 6 of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise,</i> in the
<i>Trait&eacute; de rythme, de couleur, et d&rsquo;ornithologie (1949-1992),</i> vols. 1&ndash;5 of

Samuel</i> (Portland, OR: Amadeus Press, 1994), 41.<br><a href="#FN2REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN3">3.</a> Ibid., 40. When comparing Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s synesthesia with 
that of his own in a conversation with Claude Samuel in 1967, Messiaen employed 
the term &ldquo;synopsia&rdquo; (&ldquo;synopsie&rdquo;) to describe their respective synesthetic conditions. 
He probably derived the term, moreover, from Blanc-Gatti himself (&ldquo;that strange 
disease which Blanc-Gatti<nobr> . . . </nobr>called &lsquo;synopsia&rsquo;&rdquo;). In its general definition, 
synesthesia is a blending of the senses in which one experiences a sense-perception 
other than the sense actually being stimulated. For example, one might perceive 
a scent when a particular pitch is sounded. With colored-hearing synesthesia, one 
sees colored effects or phenomena when listening to sound. Messiaen characterized 
Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s colored-hearing synesthesia as physiological and his own as more inward. 
In Messiaen&rsquo;s view, Blanc-Gatti possessed &ldquo;a synaesthesia in its most commonly occurring 
form: a spontaneous association of the senses of seeing and hearing.&rdquo; In other words, 
the painter actually saw colors and shapes when he heard music. (In the later conversations 
with Claude Samuel in 1986, &ldquo;physiological synesthesia&rdquo; [&ldquo;synesth&eacute;sie physiologique&rdquo;], 
not synopsia, is used to describe Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s colored hearing.) Conversely, Messiaen 
described his hearing of color as not involving what he saw in the physical world 
but what he saw inwardly: when reading or hearing a score, he visualized corresponding 
phenomena of color. See Claude Samuel, <i>Entretiens avec Olivier Messiaen</i> (Paris: 
Pierre Belfond, 1967); trans. Felix Aprahamian as <i>Conversations with Olivier 
Messiaen</i> (London: Stainer &amp; Bell, 1967), 15&ndash;17; and idem, <i>Music and Color,</i>

Messiaens</i> (Duisburg: Gilles und Francke, 1984); trans. Barbara Dagg, Nancy Poland,

relationships in the formation and use of his harmonies, Messiaen became increasingly 
attracted to timbre. As a matter of fact, he referred to later works such as <i>
Des canyons aux &eacute;toiles</i> (1971&ndash;74) as including more instrumental effects than 
those contained in his earlier works (R&ouml;ssler, <i>Contributions to the Spiritual 
World of Olivier Messiaen,</i> 108). Messiaen&rsquo;s increasing attraction to timbre 
may be attributed to a desire to renew his compositional thinking in order to revitalize 
his music. This desire for renewal can be seen throughout Messiaen&rsquo;s career in the 
form of experiments in rhythm, forays into serialism, and the absorption of birdsong 
into his musical language. Thus, in his preoccupation with timbre in works from 
the 1970s&ndash;80s, we see a continuation of Messiaen&rsquo;s desire for renewal, which strongly 
suggests, in the final analysis, a youthful spirit at play in a composer writing 
music in his old age.<br><a href="#FN5REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN6">6.</a> The term additive design is derived from the idea of additivity 
in Messiaen&rsquo;s music in which musical elements, through their constant accumulation, 
project a larger musical picture in the same way that a mosaic of the diverse fragments 
combined in stained-glass windows projects a visual image.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> Messiaen refers to his approach to composition in both specific 
and general terms with respect to color. Because of his colored-hearing synesthesia, 
the analogy is closest concerning his use of harmonic structures, and increasingly 
more distant with timbre and rhythm.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> See Jean-Christophe Marti, &ldquo;Entretien avec Olivier Messiaen,&rdquo;

extension of the &lsquo;hexatonic&rsquo; collection which has been shown to underpin some of 
the expansions of tonality undertaken by composers such as Liszt, Wagner and Brahms, 
though there is no evidence that Messiaen was explicitly aware of the connection&rdquo; 
(Anthony Pople, <i>Messiaen:</i> Quatuor pour la fin du Temps, Cambridge Music Handbooks,

the sounding of notes that represent artificial harmonics below a given chord to 
modify its timbre. These artificial harmonics should be absorbed as much as possible 
into the sound of the given chord. Robert Sherlaw Johnson characterizes inferior 
resonance as taking the form of a chord played loudly in the low register of the 
piano against a note or chord sounded above (<i>Messiaen</i> [Berkeley: University 
of California Press, 1989], 17).<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 3:86. Messiaen&rsquo;s explanations 
regarding the construction of turning chords are more metaphorical than precise. 
For instance, in the <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme</i> (3:238), he refers to an earlier version 
of turning chords used in pieces such as <i>Visions de l&rsquo;Amen</i> (1943) and <i>
Harawi</i> (1945) as &ldquo;&lsquo;columns of air in mobile resonances&rsquo; (like the wind in the 
trees)&rdquo; (&ldquo;&lsquo;colonnes d&rsquo;air en r&eacute;sonances mobiles&rsquo; [comme le vent dans les arbres]&rdquo;). 
Yet, turning chords feature some of the most complex color associations of any chord 
type in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. In fact, Messiaen&rsquo;s analysis of the turning chords used 
in Strophe I of <i>Chronochromie</i> (1960) provides a detailed picture of their 
coloristic complexity (see <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 3: 85&ndash;86). In the example provided for note 22 (in the text), the turning 
chords of this particular transpositional level elicit the dominant color of &ldquo;pale 
    yellow striped with white, black, and gray, with green specks&rdquo; (&ldquo;jaune p&acirc;le, ray&eacute; 
de blanc, de noir, et de gris, avec des taches vertes&rdquo;). Moreover, each chord contains 
a varied assortment of colors: first turning chord: &ldquo;pale yellow, mauve,&mdash;copper-colored 
rose, pearl gray&rdquo;; second turning chord: &ldquo;chrysoprase [apple-green], dull bluish 
green&mdash;dark sardonyx, white, and reddish brown&mdash;with some pale yellow&rdquo;; third turning 
chord: &ldquo;rock crystal&mdash;glistening deep green &rdquo;cat&rsquo;s eye&ldquo; [a gem displaying opalescent 
reflections from within].&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN22REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN23">23.</a> <i>Conf&eacute;rence de Notre-Dame,</i> 10.<br><a href="#FN23REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN24">24.</a> In his study on Messiaen, Harry Halbreich, a student of 
Messiaen&rsquo;s at the Paris Conservatoire, was the first scholar to list the color associations 
suggested by specific modal transpositions in the composer&rsquo;s colored-hearing synesthesia. 
Specifically, Halbreich lists the color associations for every transposition of 
modes 2, 3, 4, and 6 (modes 1, 5, and 7 are not listed). While he does not list 
the source or sources for these attributions, we can only surmise that Halbreich 
must have obtained the information from either Messiaen himself or from both published 
and unpublished descriptions of the composer&rsquo;s works, for the colors listed by Halbreich 
for modes 2 and 3 and most of the colors listed for modes 4 and 6 match many of 
Messiaen&rsquo;s published statements regarding the colors he associates with these modes. 
In both his 1986 article and later book chapter, Jonathan W. Bernard supplements 
Halbreich&rsquo;s work by tracking down Messiaen&rsquo;s coloristic descriptions of specific 
modal passages in his music and tabulating them (see the tables entitled &ldquo;Modally-Based 
Coloration in Messiaen&rsquo;s Compositions&rdquo; in both sources). While listing every transposition 
of modes 2 and 3 and the colors they suggest in specific compositions, Bernard provides 
a partial list of the colors associated with modes 4 and 6 (due to the omission, 
no doubt, of certain transpositions of modes 4 and 6 and their color associations 
in Messiaen&rsquo;s descriptions), implying further preferences on Messiaen&rsquo;s part as 
to both the specific modes and transpositional levels he uses. See Harry Halbreich,

chromaticism suggesting ruby red in its bottom layer, crimson red in its middle 
layer, and blue-gray in its top layer. See Samuel, <i>Music and Color,</i> 148.<br><a href="#FN33REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN34">34.</a> [1] Paul Griffiths has noted the use of paired color chords 
in <i>Sept ha&iuml;ka&iuml;</i> (1962) and <i>Couleurs de la cit&eacute; c&eacute;leste</i> (1963) that 
are pitch-class complements of one another but whose associated colors according 
to Messiaen are not complements according to color theory. For instance, in the 
third measure of <i>Miyajima et le torii dans la mer</i> from <i>Sept ha&iuml;ka&iuml;,</i> 
Messiaen combines a turning chord (8-14 {3,5,6,7,8,10,11,0}) played by the strings 
with its literal complement (4-14 {9,1,2,4}) played by the piano. The turning chord 
is labeled in the score as evoking red, while its complement is labeled as evoking 
blue. For Griffiths, if one applies the rules of color complementation to these 
aggregates, then the chord in the piano should suggest green rather than blue. He 
concludes that instead of seeking a direct correlation between color and harmony 
in these paired color chords, one should focus on the musical interaction between 
them when considering Messiaen&rsquo;s coloristic effects. To reinforce this viewpoint, 
Griffiths explores harmonic relationships in the modes of limited transposition, 
especially what he refers to as the complementary relationship between A major and 
<?php flat(E)?> major in mode 2:1. See Paul Griffiths, <i>Olivier 
Messiaen and the Music of Time</i> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 
203&ndash;6.</p>
<p>[2] Griffiths&rsquo;s conclusion warrants further discussion. If one employs the rules 
of color complementation to predict the colors associated with Messiaen&rsquo;s aggregates, 
then one will be disappointed, for that particular correlation between color and 
harmony is distant in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. However, if one interprets these aggregates 
as comprised of two contrasting textural layers with the upper layer&rsquo;s pitch materials 
and timbre providing the musical equivalent of a coloristic glow above that of the 
lower layer&rsquo;s, then the correlation between color and harmony is closer. In other 
words, our attention focuses on the interaction between the two opposing layers&mdash;the 
essence of simultaneous contrast&mdash;rather than on each layer individually. Indeed, 
this point underlies Messiaen&rsquo;s remarks to Almut R&ouml;ssler mentioned above. When Messiaen 
refers to his use of pitch-class complementation in terms of the &ldquo;well[-]known phenomenon 
of complementary colours,&rdquo; he is underscoring the analogy between the musical interaction 
of two sonorities that are pitch-class complements of one another and the coloristic 
interaction of two hues in simultaneous contrast, best exemplified by complementary 
colors. The rules of color complementation have little, if any, relevance to analyzing 
the sound-color relationships involved in Messiaen&rsquo;s aggregates.<br><a href="#FN34REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN35">35.</a> In the context of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise,</i> &ldquo;perfect

Messiaen&rsquo;s approach to birdsong in which he attempts to reflect the timbre of a 
bird&rsquo;s music through harmonic means. The tubular bells and suspended cymbal augment 
the xylos&rsquo; sound through a sustained sonic wash of both pitched and non-pitched 
resonance elements: throughout the entire &ldquo;perfect joy&rdquo; commentary, the tubular

whom he could show compassion, which will be symbolized by kissing the leper he 
meets. In <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux,</i> Saint Francis&rsquo;s prayer is answered as he 
meets the Leper in a leper-hospital near Assisi. The Leper is filled with rage, 
complaining about his condition and cursing God. With the Angel&rsquo;s help, Saint Francis 
encourages the Leper to have a change of heart. The scene culminates in the two 
men embracing, which initiates the double miracle of the Leper&rsquo;s cure and Saint Francis&rsquo;s 
elevation to sainthood. In Messiaen&rsquo;s view, <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux</i> is the opera&rsquo;s

a high degree of disassociation among its pitch-timbres, let us consider a passage 
from the orchestral introduction of <i>Le baiser </i><i>au l&eacute;preux</i> (R4: 1&ndash;R5: 4). 
This compound additive design is composed of three simultaneous pitch schemes that 
are played by the strings, brass, and woodwinds, respectively. Each scheme yields 
different pitch collections (modes 3:3 and 3:1, chords of contracted resonance, 
and two quasi-chromatic hexachords [6-Z37 and 6-Z38]) that are fixed in register 
and dynamics. The pitch collections, moreover, overlap vertically and produce a 
thick chordal texture. </p>
<p>[2] There is a three-way contrast of pitch and timbre in the passage. Through 
their merging with different timbres, the pitch collections are more successful 
in maintaining their identities. Thus, we hear a string-colored mode 3, brass-tinged 
chords of contracted resonance, and woodwind-shaded chromatic collections within 
a congested pitch space. These pitch-timbres, moreover, exhibit no connections with 
each other, only separations, which engender a musical shape that has not reconciled 
itself with its inner conflicts. Indeed, perhaps the inclusion of this passage in 
the introduction to scene 3 depicts the state of the uncured Leper, who has not 
reconciled himself to God.<br><a href="#FN49REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN50">50.</a> In his two articles on sound-color relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s 
music (the latter article an amplification of the former), Jonathan W. Bernard delves 
into Messiaen&rsquo;s synesthetic responses to gain a deeper understanding of Messiaen&rsquo;s 
harmonic structures and how they are used in his music. See Bernard, &ldquo;Messiaen&rsquo;s 
Synaesthesia,&rdquo; 41&ndash;68; and idem, &ldquo;Colour,&rdquo; 203&ndash;19. Paul Griffiths has also written 
on the subject of sound-color relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. In an article celebrating 
Messiaen&rsquo;s seventieth birthday for <i>The Musical Times,</i> Griffiths investigates 
how sound and color correspond in order to shed light on Messiaen&rsquo;s harmonic practice. 
He incorporates much of this examination of sound-color relationships in his book
<i>Olivier Messiaen and the Music of Time</i> (see note 34 above). See Paul Griffiths, 
&ldquo;<i>Catalogue de couleurs:</i> Notes on Messiaen&rsquo;s Tone Colours on His 70th Birthday,&rdquo;

there is additional evidence suggesting that simultaneous contrast strongly influences 
the way Messiaen structures his music. In addition to referring to Delaunay and 
Blanc-Gatti in his interviews and lectures, Messiaen mentioned the work of other 
painters in his discussions about the analogies between music and painting and, 
more specifically, through his linking of various composers with various painters 
(for example, Schoenberg and Kandinsky). Messiaen noted the use of simultaneous 
contrast in the works of the more modern painters he mentions. When discussing Wassily 
Kandinsky&rsquo;s (1866&ndash;1944) influence on his poetry in an interview with his student 
Larry W. Peterson in New York City on November 9, 1970, Messiaen remarked how &ldquo;he 
loved the interaction of red and green in Wassily Kandinsky&rsquo;s painting.&rdquo; Finally, 
when interviewed  for a British television program in 1985 on the life and work 
of Messiaen, the composer George Benjamin, who also studied with Messiaen, remarked 
how Messiaen could give someone listening to his music a harmonic shock by following 
one sonority associated with red by another one associated with green. Benjamin 
maintains that while we may not see the actual colors involved, we will notice a 
difference in sound or timbre between the two sonorities. See the <i>Conf&eacute;rence

the stage lighting, scenery, and costumes at the 1983 performances of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois 
d&rsquo;Assise</i> conformed in only general ways to the sound-colors evoked by the score 
in his colored hearing, because there were &ldquo;a thousand colors [on a single page 
of the score], and that&rsquo;s impossible to reproduce.&rdquo; While we should not take Messiaen 
literally about the thousand colors per page, numerous color associations are evoked 
for him by each page of the opera&rsquo;s score, as evinced by a perusal of his analysis 
of the blackcap&rsquo;s music from <i>Le Pr&ecirc;che aux oiseaux</i> in the <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 
5: 346&ndash;58.<br><a href="#FN53REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN54">54.</a> <i>Olivier Messiaen: The Music of Faith.</i><br><a href="#FN54REF">Return to text</a></p><div id="fndiv1" class="flyoverdiv">In the <i>Conf&eacute;rence de Notre-Dame,</i> Messiaen stated

&agrave; Notre-Dame de Paris le 4 d&eacute;cembre 1977</i> [Paris: Alphonse Leduc, 1978], 10). 
This does not mean, however, that a single pitch cannot affect the color association 
of the chord in which it functions as either a member or an added note. Indeed, 
a single pitch frequently adds another color to its parent chord by its doubling 
in a higher octave register or by its placement as an added note at the top of the 
chord. See Messiaen&rsquo;s analysis of a musical passage associated with the blackcap 
in <i>Le Pr&ecirc;che aux oiseaux,</i> scene 6 of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise,</i> in the
<i>Trait&eacute; de rythme, de couleur, et d&rsquo;ornithologie (1949-1992),</i> vols. 1&ndash;5 of

Samuel</i> (Portland, OR: Amadeus Press, 1994), 41.</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">Ibid., 40. When comparing Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s synesthesia with 
that of his own in a conversation with Claude Samuel in 1967, Messiaen employed 
the term &ldquo;synopsia&rdquo; (&ldquo;synopsie&rdquo;) to describe their respective synesthetic conditions. 
He probably derived the term, moreover, from Blanc-Gatti himself (&ldquo;that strange 
disease which Blanc-Gatti . . . called &lsquo;synopsia&rsquo;&rdquo;). In its general definition, 
synesthesia is a blending of the senses in which one experiences a sense-perception 
other than the sense actually being stimulated. For example, one might perceive 
a scent when a particular pitch is sounded. With colored-hearing synesthesia, one 
sees colored effects or phenomena when listening to sound. Messiaen characterized 
Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s colored-hearing synesthesia as physiological and his own as more inward. 
In Messiaen&rsquo;s view, Blanc-Gatti possessed &ldquo;a synaesthesia in its most commonly occurring 
form: a spontaneous association of the senses of seeing and hearing.&rdquo; In other words, 
the painter actually saw colors and shapes when he heard music. (In the later conversations 
with Claude Samuel in 1986, &ldquo;physiological synesthesia&rdquo; [&ldquo;synesth&eacute;sie physiologique&rdquo;], 
not synopsia, is used to describe Blanc-Gatti&rsquo;s colored hearing.) Conversely, Messiaen 
described his hearing of color as not involving what he saw in the physical world 
but what he saw inwardly: when reading or hearing a score, he visualized corresponding 
phenomena of color. See Claude Samuel, <i>Entretiens avec Olivier Messiaen</i> (Paris: 
Pierre Belfond, 1967); trans. Felix Aprahamian as <i>Conversations with Olivier 
Messiaen</i> (London: Stainer &amp; Bell, 1967), 15&ndash;17; and idem, <i>Music and Color,</i>

relationships in the formation and use of his harmonies, Messiaen became increasingly 
attracted to timbre. As a matter of fact, he referred to later works such as <i>
Des canyons aux &eacute;toiles</i> (1971&ndash;74) as including more instrumental effects than 
those contained in his earlier works (R&ouml;ssler, <i>Contributions to the Spiritual 
World of Olivier Messiaen,</i> 108). Messiaen&rsquo;s increasing attraction to timbre 
may be attributed to a desire to renew his compositional thinking in order to revitalize 
his music. This desire for renewal can be seen throughout Messiaen&rsquo;s career in the 
form of experiments in rhythm, forays into serialism, and the absorption of birdsong 
into his musical language. Thus, in his preoccupation with timbre in works from 
the 1970s&ndash;80s, we see a continuation of Messiaen&rsquo;s desire for renewal, which strongly 
suggests, in the final analysis, a youthful spirit at play in a composer writing 
music in his old age.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">The term additive design is derived from the idea of additivity 
in Messiaen&rsquo;s music in which musical elements, through their constant accumulation, 
project a larger musical picture in the same way that a mosaic of the diverse fragments 
combined in stained-glass windows projects a visual image.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Messiaen refers to his approach to composition in both specific 
and general terms with respect to color. Because of his colored-hearing synesthesia, 
the analogy is closest concerning his use of harmonic structures, and increasingly 
more distant with timbre and rhythm.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">See Jean-Christophe Marti, &ldquo;Entretien avec Olivier Messiaen,&rdquo;

extension of the &lsquo;hexatonic&rsquo; collection which has been shown to underpin some of 
the expansions of tonality undertaken by composers such as Liszt, Wagner and Brahms, 
though there is no evidence that Messiaen was explicitly aware of the connection&rdquo; 
(Anthony Pople, <i>Messiaen:</i> Quatuor pour la fin du Temps, Cambridge Music Handbooks,

interpretation; from American analytical perspectives, it is an altered V7add2.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">I define inferior resonance in Messiaen&rsquo;s music as involving 
the sounding of notes that represent artificial harmonics below a given chord to 
modify its timbre. These artificial harmonics should be absorbed as much as possible 
into the sound of the given chord. Robert Sherlaw Johnson characterizes inferior 
resonance as taking the form of a chord played loudly in the low register of the 
piano against a note or chord sounded above (<i>Messiaen</i> [Berkeley: University 
of California Press, 1989], 17).</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 3:86. Messiaen&rsquo;s explanations 
regarding the construction of turning chords are more metaphorical than precise. 
For instance, in the <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme</i> (3:238), he refers to an earlier version 
of turning chords used in pieces such as <i>Visions de l&rsquo;Amen</i> (1943) and <i>
Harawi</i> (1945) as &ldquo;&lsquo;columns of air in mobile resonances&rsquo; (like the wind in the 
trees)&rdquo; (&ldquo;&lsquo;colonnes d&rsquo;air en r&eacute;sonances mobiles&rsquo; [comme le vent dans les arbres]&rdquo;). 
Yet, turning chords feature some of the most complex color associations of any chord 
type in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. In fact, Messiaen&rsquo;s analysis of the turning chords used 
in Strophe I of <i>Chronochromie</i> (1960) provides a detailed picture of their 
coloristic complexity (see <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 3: 85&ndash;86). In the example provided for note 22 (in the text), the turning 
chords of this particular transpositional level elicit the dominant color of &ldquo;pale 
    yellow striped with white, black, and gray, with green specks&rdquo; (&ldquo;jaune p&acirc;le, ray&eacute; 
de blanc, de noir, et de gris, avec des taches vertes&rdquo;). Moreover, each chord contains 
a varied assortment of colors: first turning chord: &ldquo;pale yellow, mauve,&mdash;copper-colored 
rose, pearl gray&rdquo;; second turning chord: &ldquo;chrysoprase [apple-green], dull bluish 
green&mdash;dark sardonyx, white, and reddish brown&mdash;with some pale yellow&rdquo;; third turning 
chord: &ldquo;rock crystal&mdash;glistening deep green &rdquo;cat&rsquo;s eye&ldquo; [a gem displaying opalescent 
reflections from within].&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Conf&eacute;rence de Notre-Dame,</i> 10.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">In his study on Messiaen, Harry Halbreich, a student of 
Messiaen&rsquo;s at the Paris Conservatoire, was the first scholar to list the color associations 
suggested by specific modal transpositions in the composer&rsquo;s colored-hearing synesthesia. 
Specifically, Halbreich lists the color associations for every transposition of 
modes 2, 3, 4, and 6 (modes 1, 5, and 7 are not listed). While he does not list 
the source or sources for these attributions, we can only surmise that Halbreich 
must have obtained the information from either Messiaen himself or from both published 
and unpublished descriptions of the composer&rsquo;s works, for the colors listed by Halbreich 
for modes 2 and 3 and most of the colors listed for modes 4 and 6 match many of 
Messiaen&rsquo;s published statements regarding the colors he associates with these modes. 
In both his 1986 article and later book chapter, Jonathan W. Bernard supplements 
Halbreich&rsquo;s work by tracking down Messiaen&rsquo;s coloristic descriptions of specific 
modal passages in his music and tabulating them (see the tables entitled &ldquo;Modally-Based 
Coloration in Messiaen&rsquo;s Compositions&rdquo; in both sources). While listing every transposition 
of modes 2 and 3 and the colors they suggest in specific compositions, Bernard provides 
a partial list of the colors associated with modes 4 and 6 (due to the omission, 
no doubt, of certain transpositions of modes 4 and 6 and their color associations 
in Messiaen&rsquo;s descriptions), implying further preferences on Messiaen&rsquo;s part as 
to both the specific modes and transpositional levels he uses. See Harry Halbreich,

textural layers intersect frequently, thereby avoiding gaps between the layers that 
would not only insulate their registral boundaries but also facilitate their perception 
in the total musical texture.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">Orchestral timbres are defined in <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois</i> 
by standard instrumental families and sub-families (woodwinds, brass, strings, and 
percussion) and by more specialized combinations (e.g., xylos [a percussion ensemble 
composed of a xylophone, xylorimba, and marimba], Ondes Martenot).</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">Mode 1 [0,2,4,6,8,10] is contained in mode 3 [0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10].</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">The friar&rsquo;s ornithology lesson encompasses the span of

Messiaen,</i> 79.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">I identify different modes and their transpositions by 
two numbers separated by a colon: the number to the left of the colon identifies 
the specific mode and the number to the right its transposition. All transpositions 
begin on C, which are designated by the number 1. Thus, mode 2:1 refers to Messiaen&rsquo;s 
second mode of limited transposition beginning on C.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">Messiaen identified this sonority as a chord of total 
chromaticism suggesting ruby red in its bottom layer, crimson red in its middle 
layer, and blue-gray in its top layer. See Samuel, <i>Music and Color,</i> 148.</div><div id="fndiv34" class="flyoverdiv">[1] Paul Griffiths has noted the use of paired color chords 
in <i>Sept ha&iuml;ka&iuml;</i> (1962) and <i>Couleurs de la cit&eacute; c&eacute;leste</i> (1963) that 
are pitch-class complements of one another but whose associated colors according 
to Messiaen are not complements according to color theory. For instance, in the 
third measure of <i>Miyajima et le torii dans la mer</i> from <i>Sept ha&iuml;ka&iuml;,</i> 
Messiaen combines a turning chord (8-14 {3,5,6,7,8,10,11,0}) played by the strings 
with its literal complement (4-14 {9,1,2,4}) played by the piano. The turning chord 
is labeled in the score as evoking red, while its complement is labeled as evoking 
blue. For Griffiths, if one applies the rules of color complementation to these 
aggregates, then the chord in the piano should suggest green rather than blue. He 
concludes that instead of seeking a direct correlation between color and harmony 
in these paired color chords, one should focus on the musical interaction between 
them when considering Messiaen&rsquo;s coloristic effects. To reinforce this viewpoint, 
Griffiths explores harmonic relationships in the modes of limited transposition, 
especially what he refers to as the complementary relationship between A major and 
 major in mode 2:1. See Paul Griffiths, <i>Olivier 
Messiaen and the Music of Time</i> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1985), 
203&ndash;6.
[2] Griffiths&rsquo;s conclusion warrants further discussion. If one employs the rules 
of color complementation to predict the colors associated with Messiaen&rsquo;s aggregates, 
then one will be disappointed, for that particular correlation between color and 
harmony is distant in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. However, if one interprets these aggregates 
as comprised of two contrasting textural layers with the upper layer&rsquo;s pitch materials 
and timbre providing the musical equivalent of a coloristic glow above that of the 
lower layer&rsquo;s, then the correlation between color and harmony is closer. In other 
words, our attention focuses on the interaction between the two opposing layers&mdash;the 
essence of simultaneous contrast&mdash;rather than on each layer individually. Indeed, 
this point underlies Messiaen&rsquo;s remarks to Almut R&ouml;ssler mentioned above. When Messiaen 
refers to his use of pitch-class complementation in terms of the &ldquo;well[-]known phenomenon 
of complementary colours,&rdquo; he is underscoring the analogy between the musical interaction 
of two sonorities that are pitch-class complements of one another and the coloristic 
interaction of two hues in simultaneous contrast, best exemplified by complementary 
colors. The rules of color complementation have little, if any, relevance to analyzing 
the sound-color relationships involved in Messiaen&rsquo;s aggregates.</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">In the context of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise,</i> &ldquo;perfect 
joy&rdquo; occurs when a person, in the spirit of Christ, accepts suffering as repentance 
for sins, those of himself and others.</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv">Within the passage, Messiaen uses set class 6-Z17 {6,7,8,10,1,2} to suggest a chord of transposed inversions on  (first inversion {1,2,3,6,7,8,10}).</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">The xylos are joined by the tubular bells and suspended 
cymbal in the skylark I&rsquo;s music (not shown in Example 9). Since the sounds produced 
by these two instruments are only tangentially related to the musical contrast generated 
by the xylos and woodwinds, they should not be considered from a textural standpoint 
to be on a par with the music played by those two ensembles. Every note of the skylark 
I&rsquo;s song is provided with a chord played by the xylos, which is in keeping with 
Messiaen&rsquo;s approach to birdsong in which he attempts to reflect the timbre of a 
bird&rsquo;s music through harmonic means. The tubular bells and suspended cymbal augment 
the xylos&rsquo; sound through a sustained sonic wash of both pitched and non-pitched 
resonance elements: throughout the entire &ldquo;perfect joy&rdquo; commentary, the tubular 
bells play a more sustained melodic line when compared to the xylos, and the suspended 
cymbal plays a sustained trill.</div><div id="fndiv38" class="flyoverdiv">Samuel, <i>Music and Color,</i> 219&ndash;20, 247&ndash;48. Figure

overcome his fear of lepers. He asks God that he be allowed to meet a leper for 
whom he could show compassion, which will be symbolized by kissing the leper he 
meets. In <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux,</i> Saint Francis&rsquo;s prayer is answered as he 
meets the Leper in a leper-hospital near Assisi. The Leper is filled with rage, 
complaining about his condition and cursing God. With the Angel&rsquo;s help, Saint Francis 
encourages the Leper to have a change of heart. The scene culminates in the two 
men embracing, which initiates the double miracle of the Leper&rsquo;s cure and Saint Francis&rsquo;s 
elevation to sainthood. In Messiaen&rsquo;s view, <i>Le baiser au l&eacute;preux</i> is the opera&rsquo;s 
key scene because of this embrace and double miracle (Samuel, <i>Music and Color,</i> 
214).</div><div id="fndiv41" class="flyoverdiv">Mode 3:3 yields quickly to a diatonic collection (5-35 
{2,4,6,9,11}) that accentuates the return of the A-major chord. The sonority, which

a plagal cadence at the foreground.</div><div id="fndiv42" class="flyoverdiv">All color associations mentioned in this and the

  </div><div id="fndiv45" class="flyoverdiv">The actual passage by Saint Thomas Aquinas reads as follows: 
&ldquo;Just as human reason fails to grasp the import of poetical utterance on account 
of its deficiency in truth, neither can it grasp divine things perfectly on account 
of their superabundance of truth; and therefore in both cases there is need of representation 
by sensible figures&rdquo; (Saint Thomas Aquinas, <i>Summa </i><i>Theologiae</i> I&ndash;II, 
q 101, a 2, ad 2; <i>Summa Theologiae,</i> Latin text, English translation, introduction, 
and notes by David Bourke and Arthur Littledale, 60 volumes [New York: Blackfriars 
in conjunction with McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1969], 29: 118&ndash;21).</div><div id="fndiv46" class="flyoverdiv">Ferguson, <i>Signs and Symbols in Christian Art,</i> 91&ndash;92.</div><div id="fndiv47" class="flyoverdiv">While Example 12 displays only the first four measures 
of the Angel&rsquo;s music (R89: 1&ndash;4), the pitch schemes described in these measures apply 
to the rest of the music (R89: 5&ndash;16).</div><div id="fndiv48" class="flyoverdiv">In like manner, the simultaneous contrast of two complementary 
colors suggests all primary colors. For instance, red coupled with green implies 
the presence of red, yellow, and blue.</div><div id="fndiv49" class="flyoverdiv">[1] To illustrate a compound additive design that exhibits 
a high degree of disassociation among its pitch-timbres, let us consider a passage 
from the orchestral introduction of <i>Le baiser </i><i>au l&eacute;preux</i> (R4: 1&ndash;R5: 4). 
This compound additive design is composed of three simultaneous pitch schemes that 
are played by the strings, brass, and woodwinds, respectively. Each scheme yields 
different pitch collections (modes 3:3 and 3:1, chords of contracted resonance, 
and two quasi-chromatic hexachords [6-Z37 and 6-Z38]) that are fixed in register 
and dynamics. The pitch collections, moreover, overlap vertically and produce a 
thick chordal texture. 
[2] There is a three-way contrast of pitch and timbre in the passage. Through 
their merging with different timbres, the pitch collections are more successful 
in maintaining their identities. Thus, we hear a string-colored mode 3, brass-tinged 
chords of contracted resonance, and woodwind-shaded chromatic collections within 
a congested pitch space. These pitch-timbres, moreover, exhibit no connections with 
each other, only separations, which engender a musical shape that has not reconciled 
itself with its inner conflicts. Indeed, perhaps the inclusion of this passage in 
the introduction to scene 3 depicts the state of the uncured Leper, who has not 
reconciled himself to God.</div><div id="fndiv50" class="flyoverdiv">In his two articles on sound-color relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s 
music (the latter article an amplification of the former), Jonathan W. Bernard delves 
into Messiaen&rsquo;s synesthetic responses to gain a deeper understanding of Messiaen&rsquo;s 
harmonic structures and how they are used in his music. See Bernard, &ldquo;Messiaen&rsquo;s 
Synaesthesia,&rdquo; 41&ndash;68; and idem, &ldquo;Colour,&rdquo; 203&ndash;19. Paul Griffiths has also written 
on the subject of sound-color relationships in Messiaen&rsquo;s music. In an article celebrating 
Messiaen&rsquo;s seventieth birthday for <i>The Musical Times,</i> Griffiths investigates 
how sound and color correspond in order to shed light on Messiaen&rsquo;s harmonic practice. 
He incorporates much of this examination of sound-color relationships in his book
<i>Olivier Messiaen and the Music of Time</i> (see note 34 above). See Paul Griffiths, 
&ldquo;<i>Catalogue de couleurs:</i> Notes on Messiaen&rsquo;s Tone Colours on His 70th Birthday,&rdquo;
<i>The Musical Times</i> 119 (December 1978): 1035&ndash;37; and idem, <i>Olivier Messiaen 
and the Music of Time,</i> 203&ndash;6.</div><div id="fndiv51" class="flyoverdiv">Besides what has already been mentioned in this article, 
there is additional evidence suggesting that simultaneous contrast strongly influences 
the way Messiaen structures his music. In addition to referring to Delaunay and 
Blanc-Gatti in his interviews and lectures, Messiaen mentioned the work of other 
painters in his discussions about the analogies between music and painting and, 
more specifically, through his linking of various composers with various painters 
(for example, Schoenberg and Kandinsky). Messiaen noted the use of simultaneous 
contrast in the works of the more modern painters he mentions. When discussing Wassily 
Kandinsky&rsquo;s (1866&ndash;1944) influence on his poetry in an interview with his student 
Larry W. Peterson in New York City on November 9, 1970, Messiaen remarked how &ldquo;he 
loved the interaction of red and green in Wassily Kandinsky&rsquo;s painting.&rdquo; Finally, 
when interviewed  for a British television program in 1985 on the life and work 
of Messiaen, the composer George Benjamin, who also studied with Messiaen, remarked 
how Messiaen could give someone listening to his music a harmonic shock by following 
one sonority associated with red by another one associated with green. Benjamin 
maintains that while we may not see the actual colors involved, we will notice a 
difference in sound or timbre between the two sonorities. See the <i>Conf&eacute;rence 
de Notre-Dame,</i> 7&ndash;8, 11&ndash;12; R&ouml;ssler, <i>Contributions to the Spiritual World 
of Olivier Messiaen,</i> 45&ndash;46, 76, and 87; Samuel, <i>Music and Color,</i> 43&ndash;46;

its connections to color, especially with respect to the music of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois 
d&rsquo;Assise,</i> see chapter three (pages 108&ndash;76) of my dissertation, <i>Pitch Organization 
and Dramatic Design in</i> Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&rsquo;Assise<i> of Olivier Messiaen</i> (Ph.D. 
diss., Indiana University, 2001).</div><div id="fndiv53" class="flyoverdiv">In an interview with R&ouml;ssler (<i>Contributions to the 
Spiritual World of Olivier Messiaen,</i> 118), Messiaen stated that the colors of 
the stage lighting, scenery, and costumes at the 1983 performances of <i>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois 
d&rsquo;Assise</i> conformed in only general ways to the sound-colors evoked by the score 
in his colored hearing, because there were &ldquo;a thousand colors [on a single page 
of the score], and that&rsquo;s impossible to reproduce.&rdquo; While we should not take Messiaen 
literally about the thousand colors per page, numerous color associations are evoked 
for him by each page of the opera&rsquo;s score, as evinced by a perusal of his analysis 
of the blackcap&rsquo;s music from <i>Le Pr&ecirc;che aux oiseaux</i> in the <i>Trait&eacute; de rythme,</i> 
5: 346&ndash;58.</div><div id="fndiv54" class="flyoverdiv"><i>Olivier Messiaen: The Music of Faith.</i></div>
