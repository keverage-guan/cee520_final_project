<i>Ave Maria</i>,<sup><a name='FN1REF' href='#FN1' id='footnote1'>(1)</a></sup>  Margaret Bent&rsquo;s subsequent Commentary<sup><a name='FN2REF' href='#FN2' id='footnote2'>(2)</a></sup> reiterated a criticism originally made by Cristle Collins Judd<sup><a name='FN3REF' href='#FN3' id='footnote3'>(3)</a></sup> that my linking of the two 
concepts &ldquo;ficta&rdquo; and &ldquo;mode&rdquo; was inapplicable to music of the Josquin period. She provided further invaluable thoughts on &ldquo;ficta&rdquo; which are closely allied to her original thesis.<sup><a name='FN4REF' href='#FN4' id='footnote4'>(4)</a></sup> While I still consider that her conclusions are (for the most part) unassailable, this essay further explores a few areas where I think they inadequately explain musical thought and practice (as in the Josquin extract previously offered). In particular, the application of exclusively two-voice contrapuntal rules fails, in my view, to
take into consideration other important conceptual aspects: first, the linear and vertical aspects of euphony which arise from modal thinking; and second, the important conceptual distinction (affecting music composed for more than two voices) between &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmony.&rdquo; This essay does not, in my view, run counter to Bent&rsquo;s views on &ldquo;recta and ficta&rdquo; or &ldquo;counterpoint and consonance,&rdquo; but it does inevitably question (as in my previous article) some of the ways in which these are applied in performance.</font></p>

<p>[1]&ldquo;Hinc falso sunt arbitrati qui consonantiam et 
harmoniam idem esse
posuerunt. Nam quanquam harmonia consonantia est: omnis tamen 
consonantia
non facit harmoniam.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p><p>

[2] My initial misgiving about Margaret Bent&rsquo;s 
realization of a passage from
Josquin&rsquo;s <i>Ave Maria</i><sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> created a 
wide-ranging discussion in MTO-Talk
lasting for several weeks. Since the publication of Bent&rsquo;s Commentary 
upon
that article in MTO 2.6, however, this discussion seems to have become
moribund. Interest has shifted away from the original focus towards
intonation. This is in one sense welcome, but in another sense a
disappointment. While it is interesting to see arguments concerning the
possibilities of tuning one note against another (and these have 
produced
informative and provocative results), the disappointment is that we have
inadvertently moved away from the much more crucial arguments about 
which
actual notes need to be selected prior to deciding upon the question of
their relative intonations. This essay will therefore attempt to push 
the
discussion back to the original focus.
</p><p>



[3] Readers will recall that, following Bent&rsquo;s final words, the position
arrived at by the time of publication of MTO 2.6 was roughly as 
follows:</p><p>

1. I had, it seemed, made a serious mistake in attempting to link 
<i>ficta</i>
considerations with mode, since in  theoretical works &ldquo;mode&rdquo; and &ldquo;ficta&rdquo;
follow separate theoretical tracks (Judd);</p><p>

2. An attempt to review early theorists&rsquo; written <i>views</i> on the 
music of
their time can be regarded as simplistic and futile, (at least when 
their
view is retrospective). This is especially so in the case of Glarean who
(in relation to Josquin) must be disqualified on the grounds of 
chronology
(Bent). Also theorists like Glarean are unreliable as &ldquo;witnesses&rdquo; since
they had their own agendas to pursue (Judd);</p><p>

3. Some theorists are, however, more credible because these agendas
propagated&mdash;in the case of Hothby, Tinctoris and others&mdash;counterpoint
rules which it can be seen that composers of the time generally followed
(Bent);</p><p>

4. &ldquo;Mode&rdquo; was nothing more than a means of classifying melodies arrived 
at
externally by later writers, and was not demonstrably part of the actual
polyphonic composer&rsquo;s <i>modus operandi</i> (since his concerns were 
with
two-voice counterpoint and its correct vertical combinations) (Judd, 
Bent).
Further, since &ldquo;mode&rdquo; was not part of the composer&rsquo;s mind (which was 
more
occupied with the principles of counterpoint and consonance treatment),
modern editions can remain consistent with it, no matter how their
horizontal and vertical euphonies are &ldquo;logically&rdquo; realized, (i.e. by
two-voice counterpoint rules) provided they do not violate the pragmatic
melodic prescriptions of later writers (vocal range, last note of tenor
etc.) (Judd, Bent);</p><p>

5. In evaluating textures of three or more voices, the rules of 
consonance
that must be applied are those that theorists prescribed for two-voice
counterpoint. This is explained by the assumption that larger textures 
are
reduceable to (sometimes overlapping) pairs of &ldquo;primary voices.&rdquo; (Bent)
There is, apparently, no set of principles that enables us to 
differentiate
between two-voice contrapuntal considerations and (more than two-voice)
harmonic concepts, other than those that arise from dyadic harmonic
thinking.
</p><p>

[4] Although these are the main areas of concern 
to this essay, there are
other minor ones including pitch conceptualization. While this too will
emerge from some of the material considered, many other details will 
have
to be omitted as focal points.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> I 
hope to avert some of the &ldquo;surface&rdquo;
problems I ran into previously: I will avoid using 
words like &ldquo;tonality&rdquo;
(which opens up the charge of anachronistic 
thinking); I will not push
further with Glarean (for similar reasons<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup>); I shall also extract with
greater care from the writings of others.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> </p><p>

[5] The first pressing line of enquiry&mdash;and one 
which only seeks to explore
a possible theoretical relationship between &ldquo;mode&rdquo; and &ldquo;ficta&rdquo;&mdash;must be
the theoretical and practical status of mode within the context of the
later fifteenth century. It has been rightly urged by Powers<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> that a
careful attempt must be made to delineate between later categorizations 
and
the compositional process itself. Only by establishing <i>prima 
facie</i>
evidence to show that composers worked consciously within a modal 
framework
can &ldquo;mode&rdquo; as such bear upon the argument. It does not need necessarily to
be established that music was generally composed &ldquo;in&rdquo; modes as such, but
merely that the horizontal and vertical euphonies through which their 
music
was shaped and articulated had a modal basis.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> That some 
music <i>was</i> at
this time composed &ldquo;in&rdquo; particular modes is undeniable, especially where
the titles indicate this.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> But do 
these compositions stand apart from
the rest, and are those without a designated modal title &ldquo;freely&rdquo; 
composed?
If so, ought we to expect that the harmonic idiom of the &ldquo;modal&rdquo; pieces
would be essentially different, more &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; less 
&ldquo;experimental&rdquo;?
The answer can come only partly from the music itself (as we have 
already
seen from the differing views on the Josquin <i>Ave Maria</i> example). 
If music
of this age is in its concept essentially &ldquo;modal,&rdquo; then <i>how</i> is 
it? Does
this affect only the vocal range, or the final cadence, or does it even
percolate through into the ongoing melodic and harmonic infrastructure? 
If
it does, how will this affect (if at all) the choice of recta and ficta
(both of which can have long-term as well as short-term effects upon 
that
euphony)? So this question has to be addressed before further progress 
is
possible.
</p><p>

[6] Tinctoris, through his counterpoint rules, must stand as one of the 
most
prominent and credible authorities furthering our understanding of
fifteenth century musical composition. No account of music of this time 
can
be contemplated without regard to his comprehensive writings. He may 
well
provide not only an important insight into modal thought of the time, 
but
also bring these concepts and practices into close juxtaposition with 
the
very issues of recta and ficta that lie at the heart of the present 
debate.
<i>Did</i> composed music have a modal basis? If so then <i>how</i> 
were views on
recta and ficta use affected?</p><p>


[7] In his <i>Liber de natura et proprietate 
tonorum</i><sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> (dated 1476) Tinctoris described and named, in Chapter 1, the eight modes.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> He concluded the chapter by explaining how these were grouped into the four
categories Protus, Deuterus, Tritus and Tetrardus. In order to allay any
fear that this book would be interpreted as yet another account of
ecclesiastical chant and its perceived modal categories, his final 
sentence in Chapter 1 reads as follow:</p><p>

&ldquo;Hii autem sunt octo toni, quibus non tantum in cantu gregoriano qui
simplex est et planus, verum et in omni alio cantu figurato et composito
utimur, circa hoc in libello nostra fert intentio.&rdquo;</p><p>

[These however are the eight modes, which we use not merely in Gregorian
Chant which is simple and plain, but also in all other figured and 
composed
songs, about which is our purpose in this booklet.]</p><p>

[8] I will not attempt to do more than give a 
brief overview of this work,
highlighting significant details. (And I am fully aware of the dangers 
of
viewing only the &ldquo;surface,&rdquo; having already been censured by Judd and 
Bent
for this very shortcoming). But it must be understood that Tinctoris,
throughout, is primarily concerned with modal usage in <i>composed</i>
music.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> His writing is both 
prescriptive and  descriptive, and his
profuse examples (as in other works) are expressly focussed upon the
specific technical points in question.</p><p>


</p><p>
[9] His definition of mode (&ldquo;tonus&rdquo;) at the beginning of chapter 1 
(which is
reiterated at other points, and ultimately shapes the structural
presentation of chapters 19 to 49) is short and sweet:</p><p>

&ldquo;Tonus itaque nihil aliud est quam modus per quem principium, medium et
finis cuiuslibet cantus ordinatur.&rdquo;</p><p>

[&ldquo;Mode accordingly is nothing other than the manner by which the 
beginning, 
middle and end of any song whatsoever is arranged.&rdquo;</p><p>

In other words, whatever the mode, its 
articulation (and hence the music&rsquo;s)
arises through its definition at the beginning of a piece, its 
continuity
throughout that piece (determined by its vocal range and order of tones 
and
semitones), and ultimately its final close at the end.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> </p><p>

[10] In describing each mode, Tinctoris adopts a 
clinical method of
classifying diapente and diatesseron usage. Not only does this avoid 
tying
too closely each class with a &ldquo;white note scalar&rdquo; form (hence assuming 
that
the system is fully transposable), but it also provides a simple 
platform
for discussing &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; modes.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p><p>


[11] Of particular interest is his comparatively lengthy discussion of 
the
structure of modes 5 and 6 (chapters 7 and 8) where the tritone which
arises from the third-species diapente (e.g. F&ndash;B) poses an issue. But
having touched upon this, he goes on to state:</p><p>

&ldquo;Notandum autem quod non solum in hiis duobus tonis tritonus est 
evitandus,
sed etiam in omnibus aliis.&rdquo;</p><p>

[Note, however, that the tritone is avoided not only in these two modes 
but
also in all the others.]</p><p>

Following written examples in all eight modes, Tinctoris extends his
observation to all the irregular modes:</p><p>

&ldquo;Denique sciendum quod non solum in tonis regularibus et vera musica
secundum exempla praemissa tritonum praedictis modis fugere ac eo uti
debemus, verum etiam in irregularibus tonis et musica ficta.&rdquo;</p><p>

[Finally, the understanding is that we remove 
the tritone and its use not
only from the regular modes and <i>musica vera</i> according to the 
previous
examples in the aforesaid manner, (but) truly also from the irregular 
modes
and <i>musica ficta</i>.]<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p><p>

[12] Modes 5 and 6, as noted above, involve some discussion of the 
tritone
and diminished fifth. In none of the examples he gives is <i>ficta</i> 
as such
an issue because changes occur through <i>recta</i> means (the lowest 
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is not
involved). He does, however, state (Chapter 8):</p><p>

&ldquo;Praeterea uterque istorum duorum tonorum formari potest ex quarta 
specie
diapente quod, nisi exigente necessitate, fieri minime debet.&rdquo;</p><p>

[Further, it is possible to form either of these two modes from the 
fourth
species of diapente, something which should be done as little as 
possible
and only through pressing necessity.]</p><p>

This means that when the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is necessarily 
introduced (to eliminate the
tritone), it should only be done for this express purpose.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p><p>

[13] Ficta and Mode are sometimes regarded as very closely interlocked, 
the
one explaining the appearance of the other. Thus, in Chapter 18, 
Tinctoris
does not explaina <i>ficta</i> use of low <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in a protus context as 
having been
arrived primarily by the addition of <i>ficta</i>, but rather by the 
mixing of
modes. His two-voice example, where two notes in the lower voice are
flattened in order to avoid &ldquo;fa contra mi&rdquo; combinations with the upper
voice, is preceded by this caution:</p><p>

&ldquo;Ultra scire debemus quod toni commixtio interdum fit necessitate et
interdum voluntate, necessitate quidem ne fa contra mi in concordantia
perfecte fiat.&rdquo;</p><p>

[Additionally, we should note that a mixing of modes is made, sometimes
through necessity and sometimes through choice; by necessity so that fa
will not occur against mi in a perfect concordance.]</p><p>

However, the explanation which follows the example states that this 
change
of mode is the result of <i>ficta</i> application:</p><p>

&ldquo;Namque contrapunctus iste est secundi toni quarto commixti, eo quod per
illud fa in <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> mi fictum et contra fa F fa ut gravis positum concreatur
secunda species diatesseron quarto tono, ut praevidimus, 
specificata.&rdquo;</p><p>

[&ldquo;Now this counterpoint is of mode 1 mixed with 
mode 4 because, by having
changed <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> mi to ficta fa against fa of low F fa ut, the second type of
diatesseron, specified for mode 4, is created as we have seen above.&rdquo;]<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> </p><p>

[14] Tinctoris has therefore deemed there to have 
been a change (or at least
a mixing) of mode which, because of the need to avoid the tritone, has
created a modal transformation via the application of ficta.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup></p><p>

[15] But perhaps his next sentences are the most telling(?):</p><p>

&ldquo;Voluntate vero fit toni commixtio sive in simplici sive in composito
cantu, quando, praefata necessitate cessanti, compositor ea uti 
voluerit,
debetattamen accuratissime cavere quomodo eam ordinet. Nihil enim est 
quod
cantus distonitos efficiat quam commixtio ipsa si fuerit inordinata.&rdquo;
</p><p>
[The mixing of modes can certainly be made by 
choice, whether in simple or
composed song, when&mdash;the aforesaid necessity having ceased&mdash;the composer
might have wished to use it; he should nevertheless take extreme care 
over
the manner in which he arranges it. For there is nothing to make songs 
go
more out of the mode than this mixing were it to have been 
ill-arranged.]
<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p><p>

[16] I hope that the above very brief surface view of Tinctoris at least
conveys the following important points: a) modal thinking and evaluation
<i>may</i> have become part of the later fifteenth-century counterpoint
theorist&rsquo;s concern, b) <i>recta</i> and <i>ficta</i> usage may not only 
have been
conceived with regard to the hand (which device enabled them to be
effectively applied in practice) but also with regard to modal thought 
and
expression, and c) by this time &ldquo;ficta&rdquo; and &ldquo;mode&rdquo; may have been brought
closer together as theoretical companions.</p><p>

[17] Leaving aside the question of mode for the 
present, another issue to
examine (before we look at actual musical examples) is the question of
counterpoint. Margaret Bent<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> 
stated unambiguously what she meant by the
term &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo;: &ldquo;Counterpoint, as defined in DF from Tinctoris and
earlier theorists, is concerned not with lines or vague general 
attributes
but with <i>two-voice</i> progressions&mdash;what we might call two-part or 
<i>dyadic
harmony</i>.&rdquo; It was this view, pursued with 
perfect logic, that shaped her
proposal for the Josquin <i>Ave Maria</i> passage, this view being 
articulated
again in her recent Commentary:<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup>   In the disputed measures, he gives us
not just one text-book sequential &ldquo;cliche&rdquo; chain of fifths and sixths, 
but
<i>two</i> superimposed contrapuntal pairs, discant and tenor, tenor 
and bass
<i>both</i> of which (not just the upper pair,<i> pace</i> Wibberley) 
have claims to
perfection <i>and</i> place constraints on the other.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>  My problem with this
explanation is the assumption that an essentially three-voice structure
should be comprised of &ldquo;two superimposed contrapuntal pairs.&rdquo; The
describing of counterpoint as &ldquo;dyadic harmony&rdquo; is certainly appropriate 
for
the earlier fifteenth century (and before), but I question its 
<i>exclusive</i>
application to music of the Josquin period.
</p><p>

[18] The quotation at the head of this essay, from Gaffurius, draws a 
rather
clearer distinction between two-voice and three-voice textures, and may 
be
reiterated:</p><p>

&ldquo;Hinc falso sunt arbitrati qui consonantiam et harmoniam idem esse
posuerunt. Nam quanquam harmonia consonantia est: omnis tamen 
consonantia
non facit harmoniam. Consonantia namque ex acuto et gravi generatur 
sono:
Harmoniam vero ex acuto et graui conficiunt atque medio&rdquo;</p><p>

[Hence falsly judged are those who lay down that consonance and harmony 
are
the same. For although harmony is consonance, all consonance does not
however produce harmony. The reason is that consonance produces high and
low sound: but Harmony brings about high and low as well as middle.]</p><p>


[19] This different perspective on &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; ultimately marks the 
dividing
line between Bent&rsquo;s view (and its musical realization) and mine, and we 
may
simply have to differ. Her discussion in [22] further emphasized this
difference. She prefers (for perfectly clear reasons) to explain:</p><p>

F	E<br>
B	C<br>
D	C</p><p>

as &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>the primary contrapuntal cadence, the sixth to octave between the 
lower
parts, has an added part above.&rdquo; My explanation (as she notes) would be
that the diminished fifth between the upper parts is supported from 
below.
Her view is primarily &ldquo;contrapuntal&rdquo; wherein the harmony is dyadic (the
lower two voices bearing the &ldquo;primary pair&rdquo;); my view is that the harmony 
is
<i>triadic</i>, within which three-voice counterpoint (with appropriate
voice-leading) occurs. Further, in her [26] she took issue with my (in
retrospect rather uninformative) discussion of acoustics which she
dismissed as being &ldquo;on a separate track (again!).&rdquo; Her assumption that 
my
introduction of an acoustic element &ldquo;confuses the issue,&rdquo; and that my
suggestion that it provides a reason for admitting the fourth as a
consonance within the contrapuntal texture indicates that I have &ldquo;to 
labour
to do so,&rdquo; is entirely consistent with her dyadic view of counterpoint. 
It
is (and she is perfectly correct) a routinely simple matter to view:</p><p>

<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>f<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>	g<br>
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>c<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>	d<br>
a	G</p><p>

as a two-voice progression with an added voice in the middle (which 
forms
its own fifth). Indeed, that is how <i>I</i> would describe her example 
(above),
which could have been taken from virtually any polyphonic composition 
from
the 13th to the early 15th century. But it does not seem to me to be a 
very
characteristic kind of cadential formula for music of the 
<i>Josquin</i> period!</p><p>

[20] Gaffurius seems to me to provide a much more clinical 
<i>harmonic</i> reason
for admitting the fourth as a consonance&mdash;and one that is not in any way
dependent upon the rules of two-voice counterpoint:</p><p>

&ldquo;Sit itaque grauissima chorda Proslambanomenos 
ac maior numerus .9216.
Acutissima Mese et minor numerus .4608. Hae inuicem dupla dimensione
diapason consonantiam sonat. His hypaten meson mediam interpono .6144.
numero signatam. Hi enim ita dispositi sunt termini: ut quam extremi
inuivem proportionem faciunt scilicet .9216. ad .4608. eam ipsam probet
differentia maioris et medii: ad differentiam medii et parvissimi.
Numerorum autem .9216. et .6144. differentia est numerus .3072. sed
numerorum 6144 et 4608 differentiam facit numerus .1536. Quod quum
huiusmodi differentias inuivem comparaueris uidelicet .3072. ad 1536.
proportionem duplam ita conspicies: quemadmodum extremi termini scilicet
.9216. ad .4608. efficere compraehenduntur.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> </p><p>

A simple paraphrase-translation (substituting for classical names the 
notes
of the gamut) is:</p><p>

&ldquo;A re has a value of 9216; a re la mi has a value of 4608. They sound a
consonance because the higher number is double the lower, and they have 
a
ratio of 2:1 (and are therefore an octave apart). If the note E la mi 
(with
a value of 6144) is placed in between, the difference between the lower 
two
notes is twice that between the upper two notes: 9216-6144=3072;
6144-4608=1536. The ratio between 3072 and 1536 is thus also 2:1 (the 
same
as the octave).&rdquo;
</p><p>

[21] This is only one of a whole plethora of 
carefully analysed &ldquo;harmonic
combinations&rdquo; yielding consonance offered by Gaffurius, with similar
explanations. In other words, fundamental to the harmonic evaluation is 
the
mathematical relationships of the upper parts of the texture to the 
lower
(of which the lowest-sounding note is paramount).<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup></p><p>

[22] None of the evaluations here offered by Gaffurius even hints at, 
let
alone <i>depends upon</i>, contrapuntal processes (not even dyadic 
ones). (This
is hardly surprising in view of the title of the work.) Counterpoint
certainly does explain how sound-combinations are arrived at the way 
they
are, but it does not (in my view) explain why, at the point of arrival, 
the
effect is what it is. On the other hand, &ldquo;the effect being what it is&rdquo;
<i>does</i> explain why counterpoint theory ended up being what it was.
</p><p>

[23] When counterpoint theory alone (particularly two-voice) is viewed 
as
the primary controlling agent of euphony and consonance, analyses such 
as
the above may well seem to be &ldquo;on a different track.&rdquo; But even if some
earlier theorists had not systematically analysed the physical 
properties
of their sounds quite in this way (presumably because their own system 
did
not yet require it), it is evident that musicians of the later fifteenth
century had begun to do so. It is the only 
explanation to account for a)
the increasing tendency for composers like Josquin apparently to 
&ldquo;break&rdquo; so
many of the previously-accepted counterpoint rules (see below), and b) a
growing number of apparently insoluble difficulties in counterpoint
treatment (of the kind addressed in <i>Ave Maria</i>) which Bent&rsquo;s 
<i>ficta</i>
thesis has done so much to unravel and illuminate.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> </p><p>

[24] Tying arguments together, and moving 
towards a musical example, I would
like to consider how modal constraints upon <i>ficta</i>, and also 
<i>ficta</i>
constraints upon mode might interact.<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup></p><p>

MODAL CONSTRAINTS UPON FICTA</p><p>

[25] Proposition (Tinctoris): &ldquo;The mixing of 
modes can certainly be made by
choice, whether in simple or composed song, when&mdash;the aforesaid 
necessity
having ceased&mdash;the composer might have wished to use it; he should
nevertheless take extreme care over the manner in which he arranges it. 
For
there is nothing to make songs go more out of the mode than this mixing
were it to have been ill-arranged.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Example 1</b>. Josquin, <i>Nymphes des bois</i> (excerpt)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em;"><audio preload="metadata" controls style="width:300px"><source src="wibberley_audioex1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="wibberley_audioex1.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script></audio></p></div>
<p>[26] Josquin&rsquo;s motet written upon the death of 
Ockeghem (<i>Nymphes des bois</i>,
which could for obvious reasons not have been composed prior to 
Gaffurius&rsquo;
<i>Practica Musicae</i>) provides a number of points of interest 
relating to
mode.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> The opening of section 2 (see <b>Example 1</b>)
is the only point where the cantus
firmus is absent, leaving the remaining four voices to sing alone.
Interestingly, here again we find what Bent calls a &ldquo;text book&rdquo; version 
of
the standard progression leading through a sequence of sixths and fifths, 
again
involving three voices. Bent will obviously view this passage as another
case where an upper primary pair is superimposed upon a lower. As if to
confirm her view, this source strategically places a flat in front of 
the
&ldquo;offending&rdquo; E in voice 3. An insuperable problem is, thereby, brought 
into
being which&mdash;for reasons to be offered&mdash;could have easily been averted
had the more obvious solution been chosen.</p><p>

[27] This short passage has to be repeated, and it is difficult to 
think of
cadencing upon any other degree than that indicated by the (relative)
notation. The insertion of the flat certainly perfects the interval with
the highest voice, but it simply cannot be followed (unlike the passage 
in
<i>Ave Maria</i>) by a flat in the lowest voice: the required cadence 
position
would otherwise be unattainable, and the phrase is simply not long 
enough
to establish another &ldquo;more suitable&rdquo; cadence degree. Additionally, the
cadence has to form a link back to the starting point. The only solution
would seem to be for the singer of voice 2 to descend on the next beat 
to
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> (a major semitone higher than the flattened note), and for the
lowest voice simultaneously to ascend to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> (forming a perfect
consonance&mdash;yes&mdash;with voice 2, but&mdash;more crucially&mdash;also a diminished-fifth relationship with the previous flattened E). A more obvious, and 
less
cumbersome way through this would surely have been for the singer of 
voice
1 to descend to <i>recta</i> B, thereby allowing a consonance to be 
formed below
on <i>recta</i> E.</p><p>

[28] This may <i>perhaps</i> be an example of what Tinctoris 
<i>might</i> call &ldquo;cantus
distonitos&rdquo; [out-of-mode song], by virtue of the overuse of 
<i>coniuncte</i>
effecting the euphony. The immediate crisis faces two other innocent 
voices
who would seem to be compelled to maintain their own linear euphony 
(within
their own modal contraints) despite compelling solicitations from the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> to the contrary. The crucial point, however, is that the 
requirements
of euphony must override the perceived requirements of counterpoint 
(just
as they must for the perceived notation of the Tenor voice). Such euphony
has little to do with a conceptual view of <i>recta</i> or <i>ficta</i> 
(which are
concerned with interval-perfection), but everything to do with a 
practical
conceptualization of mode (and its purely melodic integrity). Here, the
&ldquo;mixing of modes&rdquo; (Tinctoris) leading to <i>ficta</i> adjustment, might 
seem to
yield a poorer result than such &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; leading to <i>recta </i> 
use.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p><p>

[29] It is also possible&mdash;although obviously not within a dyadic view of
the harmony&mdash;to accept the sound of the upper diminished fifth! This is
because when harmony is partially liberated from the constraints of
two-voice counterpoint, textural considerations can (and often do&mdash;see
below) invite composers to voice-lead with more freedom. Migration of 
the
contrapuntal &ldquo;line&rdquo; between differing voices of the texture (&ldquo;vocal
interchange&rdquo;) frequently accounts for what would initially seem to be a
casual attitude to counterpoint: even though the parts may not 
<i>look</i> as
they should, they still may <i>sound</i> acceptable within their 
context. In the
present example, the E in voice 3 (measure 7) is taken over by voice 2,
ultimately to move up to the F. The <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in voice 1 (measure 7) eventually
falls to the A, although its initial rise to C could be explained 
(outside
the principles of two-voice counterpoint of course) as a result of the
movement upwards by the bass whose A also takes over the line. (As in 
<i>Ave
Maria</i>, the thematic and sequential movement of the melodies can 
possibly
be said to have taken priority here in both cases.)</p><p>

FICTA IMPOSITION UPON MODE</p><p>

[30] &ldquo;Ficta imposition upon mode&rdquo; was the substance of my view of the Josquin
passage previously examined.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> 
<i>Ave Maria</i>, however, is not perhaps the
best example through which to articulate my misgivings over such
realizations.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup>  I will examine 
what I consider to be a much better
instance.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Example 2</b>. Josquin, Absalon fili mi, measures 16&ndash;29</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em;"><audio preload="metadata" controls style="width:300px"><source src="wibberley_audioex2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"><source src="wibberley_audioex2.ogg" type="audio/ogg"><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"></script></audio></p></div>

<p>[31] Josquin&rsquo;s motet <i> Absalom fili mi</i> was 
introduced (by me) into the
mto-talk discussion, and some of my comments on that piece were taken 
up by
Bent.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> I would like to consider a 
passage beginning at measure 16, which
again presents the by-now familiar chain of 6-5 progressions (see <b>Example 2</b>).</p><p>

[32] In the tenor voice, the last note of measure 18 produces a &ldquo;mi 
contra
fa&rdquo; with voice 1. The vertical layout can be represented as follows:</p><p>

<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr><br>
D<br>
F</p><p>

which, according to Bent&rsquo;s views on two-voice counterpoint and dyadic
harmony is acceptable provided that the lower two voices are the 
&ldquo;primary
pair,&rdquo; and the contrapuntal movement (sixth to octave) which follows would 
lead
to the following scenario:</p><p>

<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>	G<br>
D	<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr><br>
F	<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr></p><p>

This, however, does not occur, and the following reality exists:</p><p>

<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>	G<br>
D	D<br>
F	G</p><p>

[33] Even if it were conceded that the tenor eventually <i>does</i> 
rise to the
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, voice 4 does <i>not</i> fall. It seems that there are two 
alternative
positions: a) that the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; two-voice principles must nonetheless be
adhered to, and b) that here is evidence of a harmonic concept that is 
not
dyadic at all, but rather triadic. Both can lead to quite different
results.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em; margin-bottom:0.5em"><b>Example 3</b>.

<p>[34] Taking first the dyadic viewpoint, this would seem to present a
situation comparable with the extract from <i>Ave Maria</i>. The 5-6
progressions with the highest voice (these two therefore constituting 
the
upper &ldquo;primary pair&rdquo;) are superimposed over another similar 5-6 chain
between the lower two voices (which are the lower &ldquo;primary pair&rdquo;). Since
(as Bent points out [22]) these &ldquo;two primary and non-cadential 
progressions
are superimposed, and the upper part therefore cannot be treated as
subsidiary,&rdquo; this must require the use of fictive adjustment in order to
produce the required consonances (see <b>Example 3</b>). There would be no alternative 
therefore
but to flatten the D. This would, however, bring into being a chain
reaction, calling for <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, then <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, then <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, and finally <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>.</p><p>

[35] This version has, I believe, some very 
crucial shortcomings, despite
its firm adherence to two-voice principles: i) in only 6 measures, the
pitch will have dropped a complete semitone (original euphonies will be
restored as early as measure 24, but a semitone lower in pitch);<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> ii)
the entries of the upper two voices at measure 21 will have undergone a
complete change of mode (within the terms of reference of Tinctoris)
whereby&mdash;despite the fact that structurally they are a restatement of 
the
opening motif&mdash;the order of tones and semitones has been changed; and 
iii)
there will be an unavoidable melodic tritone in voice 3 in measures 
22&ndash;3.
These three pieces of silver mark the price that would have to be paid
in order to avoid a single vertical diminished fifth (measure 19) for 
which
there seems to be no &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; explanation! The rules of two-voice
counterpoint are clear and unambiguous: under no conditions can this
vertical diminished fifth be left without adjustment in the counterpoint 
thus
presented! Let us look, therefore, for other rules and explanations.</p><p>


[36] An alternative view is that the diminished 
fifth and its bass support
<i>are</i> acceptable as they stand.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup>  If so, it will not be because of 
the
rules of two-voice counterpoint, but despite them. In <i>triadic</i> 
terms, the
movement of the three voices together with their vertical combinations 
is
perfectly logical: the outer voices converge on to G while the Tenor
continues its syncopated ascent becoming (at the end of measure 20) the
upper of two primary voices (the only two sounding).
</p><p>

[37] Another manifestation of triadic thinking 
can, I believe, be found at
the end of Example 2, in measures 28&ndash;9. Here the 
Tenor voice indulges in
what is&mdash;by dyadic principles&mdash;a dubious piece of voice-leading: the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>,
which forms the lower note of a tritone, <i>rises</i> to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> on the next 
chord.
The explanation is not that a <i>ficta</i> <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266e;</span><span></nobr> should have been
applied,<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> but rather that for 
textural reasons the move upwards instead
of downwards is more satisfactory.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> </p><p>

[38] I am not proposing in this essay that two-voice counterpoint 
theories
and practices have become outdated; they clearly apply in many 
instances,
especially where textures are thin. But I am suggesting that there is 
both
theoretical and practical evidence to show that musicians were becoming
conscious of other methods of contrapuntal and harmonic thought which 
may
have had a bearing upon this repertory. In this regard, to continue a
rigourous and unyielding application of concepts designed originally for
two voices, in which a second added voice merely satisfies the 
requirements
of successive vertical perfection against the given and unchangeable 
Tenor
(other voices being merely accompanimental), <i>may</i> create a greater
distortion of the later fifteenth-century composer&rsquo;s intention than is
either desirable or indeed necessary. This may become further 
exacerbated
when some (like Josquin) provide compositions of four or five vocal 
lines.
Texture, voicing and imitation now yield further constraints upon the
unfolding of the counterpoint, and upon the linear movement of the 
euphony.</p><p>

[39] There are many rip-cords by which we can extend our understanding 
and
awareness. As each is withdrawn, the hope is that our parachute of 
enquiry
will offer a smooth and meaningful descent towards the firmer ground of
experience and knowledge. We may not always judge with accuracy the
atmospheric turbulence provided by differing views on historical 
documents
as we plunge into the unknown, and we may also misjudge the ideal or
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; moment to bring our free-fall to a steady halt when noting
something that is perceived (perhaps even mistakenly) to be worthy of
comment or enquiry. But we can only start from where we are, and 
proceed to
where we judge our destination to lie. Within our quest for greater 
insight
into music of the past, Margaret Bent&rsquo;s contribution is of seminal
importance in helping us to understand not only where we are, but also
where we have to go.</p>

[Henceforward DF]. In this essay, I shall be dropping the adjective
&ldquo;diatonic.&rdquo; It was initially an important means of countering Lowinsky&rsquo;s
notion of &ldquo;chromaticism.&rdquo; If <i></i> was purely diatonic, however, the

questions posed by Bent in [23] and [24] largely because I consider 
them to
have been rhetorical.  I would, however, like to take the opportunity of
answering here one of her questions in [23] concerning Glarean where she
asks &ldquo;Does Wibberley not distinguish between subsequent comment and
classification on the one hand, and what could have been in the 
composer&rsquo;s
mind, on the other?&rdquo; My initial reaction can be likened to that of a
first-year undergraduate who&mdash;having imparted to his tutor the news of 
his
discovery of an astonishing example of <i>ficta</i> use in Josquin&rsquo;s 
<i>Ave Maria</i>
(beginning at bar 48), citing Margaret Bent&rsquo;s authority&mdash;is soundly
rebuked for not having distinguished the composer&rsquo;s mind from that of a
subsequent commentator. I then realized that the correspondence cited by
Bent was incomplete and out of chronology. The point I made about the
Josquin motet being Hypoionian answered a different  mto-talk question, 
and
merely affirmed that Glarean&mdash;who invented the category&mdash;ought to be 
able
to recognize a motet that fulfilled his criteria. More importantly, my
point about his description being concerned with the way the composer 
had
<i>composed</i> the music rather than about the way others might have 
performed
it replied to yet another mto-talk comment (again not cited by Bent) 
which
suggested that Glareanus might equally have been commenting upon his own
view of a <i>performance</i>. (I feel uneasy about the citing of 
mto-talk
comments&mdash;which are often informal exchanges&mdash;in this way as a means of
constructing a formalized case against another person&rsquo;s views and
credibility, especially when they are quoted out of their proper 
contexts.
This is one way, surely, to <i>discourage</i> people from contributing 
to
mto-talk!)<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> Let us not, incidentally, forget that Glarean&rsquo;s first 
three decades
overlapped with Josquin&rsquo;s last three. We might also bear in mind that
Glarean spent about 20 years planning his <i>Dodecachordon</i>, and 
that it was
completed by 1539&mdash;eight years before publication. This should be viewed
against assertions like &ldquo;It is indeed a big leap to go from a subsequent
theorist (especially Glarean) with his own axe to grind to make the
assumption that because this was in his mind it must have been in 
Josquin&rsquo;s
more than 50 years earlier.&rdquo; (Bent [23])<br><a href="#FN8REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN9">9.</a> I had no wish or reason intentionally to misrepresent 
the work of Bent
or others, let alone to do so &ldquo;discourteously&rdquo; (Bent, ftn. 26). That it
came over that way is something I regret, and it arose more from the
complexity of the material (both old and new) than any attempt wilfully 
to
extrapolate bits and pieces from their own context.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> Harold Powers, &ldquo;Tonal Types and Modal

may not on first
hearing betray the hexachordal design underlying its construction, but

<i>Missa Cuiusvis Toni</i>. No assumption is here made that the 
composers saw
the mode concerned as being anything other than a structural artifice 
(e.g.
the ordering of tones and semitones, together with the range of the 
Tenor).
I am merely concerned at this point to differentiate between what later
observers deduced and what actual composers planned and executed.<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> <i>Corpus Scriptorum de Musica</i>, XXII/1 
(1975), 65&ndash;104. Also available,

(Colorado Springs, 1976).<br><a href="#FN13REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN14">14.</a> The name theorists give to mode is &ldquo;tonus.&rdquo; &ldquo;Modus&rdquo; is used in the
traditional manner for describing rhythm and note-duration.  I am 
therefore
attaching no more to this term &ldquo;tonus&rdquo; than I would to the terms 
&ldquo;melody&rdquo; or &ldquo;tune.&rdquo; My interest is only in the ways in which composers organized
their &ldquo;tunes&rdquo; in counterpoint, and what precepts they felt should, if at
all, be applied additionally to those prescribed by counterpoint rules. 
I
must also correct a misleading aspect of my article (<i>MTO</i> 2.5) 
for which I
was rightly censured both by Judd and Bent. I do <i>not</i> consider 
the use of
mode <i>in itself</i> to be the equivalent of a <i>tonal system</i>. I 
shall
henceforward use the term &ldquo;euphony&rdquo; (which I hope is not so 
stereotyped),
but I need to clarify that my use of the term &ldquo;tonality&rdquo; was only 
intended
to convey the <i>harmonic result</i> of combining modally-conceived 
lines. I did
not mean to impute to composers a preconceived &ldquo;modal(=&lsquo;tonal&rsquo;)&rdquo; harmonic
framework as a canvass for the delivery of counterpoint.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> Although this is his declared main concern, he does 
cite examples from
chant at times when he is discussing modal assignations. Also, as has 
been
noted in the past, only five of his ninety or so examples employ more 
than
a single voice. Nonetheless, these melodies are mostly newly-composed 
for
the purpose and show&mdash;on a small scale befitting their theoretical 
utility&mdash;the way in which the principles outlined are to be applied and 
perceived.
Harold Powers (&ldquo;Tonal Types<nobr>. . .</nobr>&rdquo;, 432) mentions this work, doubting its
application to then current polyphony. I would again stress that my only
motive for citing passages here is to explore possible 
<i>theoretical</i>
connections between &ldquo;ficta&rdquo; and &ldquo;mode.&rdquo; It is certainly not to 
construct a
view of mode in any other way; neither is it intended to counter the 
views
of Powers (or anybody else) with regard to the work&rsquo;s authority.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> Chapters 19&ndash;49 are concerned with a discussion of 
Beginning, Middle and
End. Of these chapters, Beginning is covered simply in a single chapter
(19), while End requires six chapters (44&ndash;49). By contrast, however, 
Middle
extends from chapters 20 to 43. These develop to the maximum all the
possible admixtures and permutations of modes that are possible during 
the
actual course of a composition. This section deals not only with mixed
modal categories, but also with ambitus. End, however, is treated more
fully than Beginning since irregular endings are discussed in some 
detail,
including those where moves within and without the hand (gamut) via both
recta and ficta are discussed and exemplified.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> For example, when mode 1 is mixed with mode 7 
(primo septimo
commixtus), as discussed in chapter 13, it uses the fourth-species 
diapente
with the first-species diatesseron.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> This is one of numerous instances in Tinctoris (for 
others, see ftn 15)
implying a conceptual link between Mode and Ficta, and Tinctoris brings
them into close juxtaposition on other occasions in this work.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> The use of the Bb temporarily transforms the mode 
from tritus to
tetrardus, and its presumed cancellation&mdash;when the necessity has
disappeared&mdash;restores the mode to its proper species. This Tinctoris
considers to be important.<br><a href="#FN19REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN20">20.</a> The two concepts are brought into the same 
evaluation.<i>Ficta</i> arises
through the need for contrapuntal consonance (i.e. <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;F), but the 
resulting
melody is now explained as being a mixing of modes (by diatessaron
substitution). The word &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; refers specifically to the lower
voice which, in the example, is marked &ldquo;Contrapunctus.&rdquo; This lower voice
uses a range of A&ndash;a, and ends on D, being in mode 2. When temporarily
converted through this <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> from protus to tritus, it is regarded that the
plagal form will still operate (i.e. mode 4).<br><a href="#FN20REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN21">21.</a> Earlier in Chapter 8, Tinctoris stated that modes 5 
and 6  could use
the fourth species of diatesseron, but that this should be done as 
little
as possible, and only because of unavoidable necessity (&ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>nisi 
exigente
necessitate, fieri minime debet&rdquo;).  While it was generally assumed that
these modes admitted the Bb as a normal means of melodic adjustment, for
Tinctoris this was <i>explained</i> as a &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; of modes. While, 
therefore,
the contrapuntal need for <i>ficta</i> has placed contraints upon the 
mode
(because of the incipient tritone), it is also true that the resultant
mixing of modes 2 and 4 (which explains how the <i>melody </i> has been 
changed)
in turn has (for Tinctoris) brought constraints to bear upon the
application of <i>ficta</i> (since <i>ficta</i> here is explained as a 
mixing of
modes). Ficta and Mode are therefore (at least to Tinctoris) bound 
together
within his evaluation.<br><a href="#FN21REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN22">22.</a> Since Tinctoris speaks of the <i>songs</i> rather 
than their performance, I
interpret this as an observation of the manner in which unusual or
excessive voluntary (as opposed to normal or moderate <i>necessary</i>) 
mixing
of modes can effect the (at least melodic) euphony of the music. (A 
similar
rule was advanced by Tinctoris the following year as his fifth rule of
counterpoint.) If my interpretation is correct, this might echo Margaret
Bent&rsquo;s point at the end of her [25] when she states &ldquo;Wibberley and 
others
think that my Josquin example takes the application of the rules too far
for practical purposes, and I might even agree with them, but they (and 
I)
have yet to define precisely at what point and why &ssquo;the accepted rules 
of
consonance&rsquo; become unacceptable. Does Wibberley have a view on this?&rdquo; She
also stated in [21] &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>that there <i>can</i> be an ideal solution but 
no
perfect solution makes it very difficult to define how far is too far, 
now
that we have removed anachronistic tonal harmony, simplistic modal
restraints, and, I hope, the misapplication of modern notation as
defaults.&rdquo; What is <i>possibly</i> implied here by Tinctoris is that 
<i>he</i> may
have had a view on this. We may not quite know what that view amounted 
to
in practical terms, but since the mixing of modes outlined in his 
statement
was concerned with consonance treatment (as a &ldquo;necessity&rdquo;) it may not be
inappropriate to infer also that further &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; uses of mixed modal
types were for a similar purpose. His  <i>possible</i> caution, 
however, suggests
that there may have been a point beyond which the music, in his opinion,
may have suffered (&ldquo;cantus distonitos&rdquo;). Tintoris is not discussing what
could be described by Bent&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;simplistic modal restraints&rdquo; 
because
the modal system being outlined is both sophisticated and 
complex.<br><a href="#FN22REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN23">23.</a> DF(2), [3].<br><a href="#FN23REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN24">24.</a> DF(2), [19].<br><a href="#FN24REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN25">25.</a> I was not claiming perfection for the upper pair, as

Chapter 11. [The complete
text, together with graphics, is available on the internet at:
&ldquo;gopher://IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU:70/11/tml/16th&rdquo;.] The classical note 
names,
together with their numeric values, are also to be found in the 
hexachord
table at the beginning of Gaffurius&rsquo; <i>Practica Musicae</i> (published 
in 1496,
only a few months prior to Ockeghem&rsquo;s death). In this latter work, Book
III, Gaffurius gives a traditional survey of counterpoint with musical
examples. Although the two-voice examples are explained in two-voice 
terms
(where the harmonic result is dyadic), he moves on to examples of three-
and four-voice counterpoint where his discussion is <i>not</i> limited 
to dyadic
terms of reference. In particular, the four-voice examples are 
discussed in
terms of texture and spacing. It is true that he often discusses the
disposition of voices in relation to the Tenor voice (sometimes all the
voices are dicussed in this way), but at other times he does not. 
Neither
does he have a purely dyadic view of &ldquo;harmony,&rdquo; and he eventually went 
on
to state, as has been demonstrated, a clear difference of view between
(two-voice) &ldquo;consonance,&rdquo; and (more-than-two-voice) &ldquo;harmony.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN26REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN27">27.</a> This was what I originally meant by the term 
&ldquo;acoustic parameters,&rdquo;
though the descriptive methodology of Gaffurius is infinitely better
formulated.  His evaluations (and calculations) seem to me evidence of
<i>triadic</i> harmonic thinking.  Dyadic harmony, realized through 
two-voice
counterpoint, is (as Bent clearly demonstrates) evinced in three voices 
by
a two-voice progression to which an accompanying voice is added. When 
the
&ldquo;consonant fourth&rdquo; occurs therefore, it is only accompanimental to the
&ldquo;primary pair&rdquo; (Bent) and does not have to be evaluated as a consonance
with its own diatesseron. As long as it forms a consonance (diapente) 
with
the lowest voice it is admissible. According to Gaffurius, however, not
only is it viewed in relation to the lowest voice, but also in relation 
to
the highest. Furthermore (and moving on beyond &ldquo;consonance&rdquo; to what
Gaffurius now calls &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;&mdash;which is different), a mathematical
relationship is seen to exist between the upper pair itself and the 
lower.
Each component, therefore, is an essential part of the harmony. Within 
each
harmonic complex, the smaller units (being the higher notes) are
progressively subtracted from the larger ones to identify the 
mathematical
(and hence acoustical) relationships. Finally, the upper relationships
themselves are subtracted from the lower ones to define the overall 
level
of consonance which characterizes the particular <i>harmony</i>. This 
(surely?)
must undeniably give a hierachical superiority to the lower notes, and
ultimately to the <i>lowest</i>. Now while this is, of course, also 
true of
two-voice counterpoint giving rise to dyadic harmony, it is <i>not</i>
necessarily the case with three-part textures which are still dyadic in
concept, but which now have an added accompanying voice.<br><a href="#FN27REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN28">28.</a> I will also point out (for what it is worth only) 
that Glarean&rsquo;s words
on <i>Ave Maria</i> were descriptive of the <i>harmony</i>, no mention 
being made of
the counterpoint. Further, the difference between Bent&rsquo;s resolution of 
the
disputed passage, and that of others, lies in her view that the
middle-voice component is required to exercise (but is unable, without 
the
most careful assistance, to excise) a gymnastic display of musical
schizophrenia in being simultaneously a partner to two other voices, 
each
of which belongs to a different &ldquo;primary pair.&rdquo; Her solution, if only 
for
that reason, is all the more ingenious!<br><a href="#FN28REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN29">29.</a> Judd and Bent, remember, reject an explicit link 
between the two.
Further both insist that it is only the external factors (e.g. range of 
the
vocal part) that are relevant in determining the mode, since &ldquo;mode&rdquo; is 
not
an internal attribute of the musical euphony itself, but only a 
<i>label</i>
which can be assigned retrospectively as a result of such external
criteria.<br><a href="#FN29REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN30">30.</a> Tinctoris,<i> Liber de Natura et Proprietate 
Tonorum</i>, (1476), Chapter 18.<br><a href="#FN30REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN31">31.</a> I shall be looking only at the version preserved in 
the Medici Codex of
1518 (facsmile ed., Edward Lowinsky, &ldquo;The Medici Codex,&rdquo; <i>Monuments of
Renaissance Music</i>, V (1968), fols 125&ndash;7), where the Tenor <i>cantus 
firmus</i>
is of especial interest. The pitch of the work itself is (probably
intentionally) uncertain from this notation since there are no clefs 
(only
<i>coniuncte</i>). The Tenor, which begins on a <i>coniuncta</i>, 
delivers in
notation the standard Mode 6 version of the melody. However, the rubric
states that in performance the melody must be begun a semitone lower 
than
written. What is not spelled out, however, is that not only must this
happen, but also that the mode of the melody must be changed from 
tritus to
deuterus. Many of the intervals required will, therefore, contradict the
pragmatics of the notation (which in this sense is&mdash;to use Margaret 
Bent&rsquo;s
term&mdash;very much a &ldquo;weak default&rdquo;).<br><a href="#FN31REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN32">32.</a> Speaking of &ldquo;mixed modes&rdquo; also avoids the issue of 
whether or not
prefatory <i>coniuncte</i> (i.e. signatures) do or do not transpose the 
hand as
opposed to the mode. If they transpose the hand, and (in this case) <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>
becomes a <i>recta</i> step, all this will mean is that one mixing of 
modes may
<i>still</i> yield a better result than another (because the composer 
has
presumably exercised &ldquo;extreme care&rdquo;).<br><a href="#FN32REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN33">33.</a> This notion was rejected by Judd on the basis that 
<i>ficta</i> and mode
were unconnected, and that Bent&rsquo;s version did not violate her (both 
Judd&rsquo;s
and Bent&rsquo;s) view of &ldquo;mode&rdquo; as being only an external formalization of
pre-existent material. Bent also rejected this criticism on the grounds
that the way I was applying <i>my</i> concept of mode was a &ldquo;modern 
misprision,&rdquo; and that a view of mode as white-note diatonicism had little if 
anything to
do with fifteenth-century counterpoint. But I did not provide a view of
mode as being limited to &ldquo;white-note&rdquo; degrees, and argued that 
ficta/recta
adjustments could also be a means of modal articulation. This was (to
answer another of Bent&rsquo;s questions) why I introduced the term &ldquo;modal
fidelity&rdquo; as against her own (and Zager&rsquo;s) term &ldquo;modal purity.&rdquo;<br><a href="#FN33REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN34">34.</a> It is true, as Bent points out, that I did not 
previously cite Judd&rsquo;s
analysis of <i>Ave Maria</i> (<i>Music Analysis</i> 4:3 (1985), 201), 
but my reason
for not having done so will seem unclear from Bent&rsquo;s statement. This
analysis is not, as Bent claims, a &ldquo;modal analysis,&rdquo; but is a schematic
analysis which considers interrelationships between text and mode (as a
melodic framework), together with pitch-organization, tonal structure 
and
structural articulation. Further, no particular importance is attached 
to
the measures under consideration which, in the reduction, are presented
purely in their unadorned white-note form (because, as Judd has recently
demonstrated, she considers <i>ficta </i> to be on a completely 
different track
from considerations of mode). Judd does, however, claim that the
composition is written in the hypolydian mode, and even goes on to state
that some have described it (on Glarean&rsquo;s authority) as being 
hypoionian.
It is clearer to me now that her view of this attribute was limited to 
the
external features of the piece. I am, in view of Judd&rsquo;s and Bent&rsquo;s
criticism over chronology, happy to concede that it is indeed an 
example of
the hypolydian mode (which at least brings me into line with Judd&rsquo;s 
view),
particularly since it is indistinguishable (except in nomenclature) from
the hypoionian.<br><a href="#FN34REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN35">35.</a> Under the assumption that it was <i>I</i> who had 
argued that such pieces
<i>should</i> be composed &ldquo;without removing the harmony from its base&rdquo; (although, as readers will recall, this was only an observation of 
Glarean
which <i>he</i> had applied to the harmony of <i>Ave Maria</i> within 
his own terms
of reference), Bent was unable to understand why I should applaud 
Josquin&rsquo;s
use of modal change (&ldquo;modulation&rdquo;) found in <i>Absalom fili mi</i> as a
&ldquo;powerful rhetorical device.&rdquo; I take seriously her caution over reading 
too
much into a composer&rsquo;s intention regarding text-setting, and will not
attempt to argue for any more extra-musical association than the 
blindingly
obvious one which seeks to express the text &ldquo;et descendam in infernum&rdquo; through a sequence of falling thirds culminating in a final chord of low
pitch which includes a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> below gamma-ut.<br><a href="#FN35REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN36">36.</a> Views on pitch stability have also led to some 
serious
misunderstandings. Margaret Bent took great exception (ftn. 26) to my
inference that she viewed &ldquo;modal coherence as a close relative of pitch
stability.&rdquo; But my assumption was not drawn from the single sentence she
quoted from DF. It was arrived at on the basis of the following 
statement:
&ldquo;Did interpretations that stray from the white-note diatonicism to which
we have grown accustomed sound different or special to them? It is hard 
for
us to answer this until we have become used to thinking of sounds in a 
new
way, to doing without the conventional dividing lines we have applied
between diatonic and chromatic, <i>recta</i> and <i>ficta</i>, not to 
mention
abandoning our inherited faith in a <i>pre-tuned white-note scalar modal
chastity</i> that is open to petty violation up to an ill-defined 
point.&rdquo; (DF
pages 46&ndash;7. The italics are mine.) This followed an earlier statement
concerning the tonal movement in her Obrecht example where sho wrote 
(DT p.
35) &ldquo;Lowinsky objects that the singers would have to start the Gloria on
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, not that &lsquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&rsquo; at the end of the Kyrie makes the movement tonally
incoherent. The objection disappears if we renounce frequency 
stability.&rdquo;
Then, on the following page, she wrote &ldquo;Further, contemporary singers
without commitment to constant frequency, having applied their 
<i>coniuncte</i>
in bars 87&ndash;8, would then be in a position to read bars 89&ndash;96 <i>as if 
nothing
had happened</i>.&rdquo; (The italics again are mine) She objected [8] to my
imputation that she assumed that &ldquo;to begin a piece on F and end on <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> 
was
of little consequence for the singers&rdquo; but this was intended to mean no
more than her &ldquo;as if nothing had happened.&rdquo; Pitch depression is 
something I
believe she has conclusively proved through her Obrecht example, and I
cannot see anything other than a complete validation of her views on the
way <i>ficta</i> has to operate here. Our problem seems largely to be 
one of
misunderstanding what we are really saying, and Bent has clarified for 
me
now that pitch &ldquo;instability&rdquo; when it occurred did so <i>with</i> the 
awareness
of the singer. This is what I would have assumed, especially since she 
has
also pointed out to us [4] that they had no term to distinguish F from
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>F<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. Such a position would more credibly prescribe a greater rather

a lesser need to be aware of the pitches <i>actually</i> being sung.<br><a href="#FN36REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN37">37.</a> Bent (22) proposes that a diminished 5th which

them to
have been rhetorical.  I would, however, like to take the opportunity of
answering here one of her questions in [23] concerning Glarean where she
asks &ldquo;Does Wibberley not distinguish between subsequent comment and
classification on the one hand, and what could have been in the 
composer&rsquo;s
mind, on the other?&rdquo; My initial reaction can be likened to that of a
first-year undergraduate who&mdash;having imparted to his tutor the news of 
his
discovery of an astonishing example of <i>ficta</i> use in Josquin&rsquo;s 
<i>Ave Maria</i>
(beginning at bar 48), citing Margaret Bent&rsquo;s authority&mdash;is soundly
rebuked for not having distinguished the composer&rsquo;s mind from that of a
subsequent commentator. I then realized that the correspondence cited by
Bent was incomplete and out of chronology. The point I made about the
Josquin motet being Hypoionian answered a different  mto-talk question, 
and
merely affirmed that Glarean&mdash;who invented the category&mdash;ought to be 
able
to recognize a motet that fulfilled his criteria. More importantly, my
point about his description being concerned with the way the composer 
had
<i>composed</i> the music rather than about the way others might have 
performed
it replied to yet another mto-talk comment (again not cited by Bent) 
which
suggested that Glareanus might equally have been commenting upon his own
view of a <i>performance</i>. (I feel uneasy about the citing of 
mto-talk
comments&mdash;which are often informal exchanges&mdash;in this way as a means of
constructing a formalized case against another person&rsquo;s views and
credibility, especially when they are quoted out of their proper 
contexts.
This is one way, surely, to <i>discourage</i> people from contributing 
to
mto-talk!)</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Let us not, incidentally, forget that Glarean&rsquo;s first 
three decades
overlapped with Josquin&rsquo;s last three. We might also bear in mind that
Glarean spent about 20 years planning his <i>Dodecachordon</i>, and 
that it was
completed by 1539&mdash;eight years before publication. This should be viewed
against assertions like &ldquo;It is indeed a big leap to go from a subsequent
theorist (especially Glarean) with his own axe to grind to make the
assumption that because this was in his mind it must have been in 
Josquin&rsquo;s
more than 50 years earlier.&rdquo; (Bent [23])</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">I had no wish or reason intentionally to misrepresent

attaching no more to this term &ldquo;tonus&rdquo; than I would to the terms 
&ldquo;melody&rdquo; or &ldquo;tune.&rdquo; My interest is only in the ways in which composers organized
their &ldquo;tunes&rdquo; in counterpoint, and what precepts they felt should, if at
all, be applied additionally to those prescribed by counterpoint rules. 
I
must also correct a misleading aspect of my article (<i>MTO</i> 2.5) 
for which I
was rightly censured both by Judd and Bent. I do <i>not</i> consider 
the use of
mode <i>in itself</i> to be the equivalent of a <i>tonal system</i>. I 
shall
henceforward use the term &ldquo;euphony&rdquo; (which I hope is not so 
stereotyped),
but I need to clarify that my use of the term &ldquo;tonality&rdquo; was only 
intended
to convey the <i>harmonic result</i> of combining modally-conceived 
lines. I did
not mean to impute to composers a preconceived &ldquo;modal(=&lsquo;tonal&rsquo;)&rdquo; harmonic
framework as a canvass for the delivery of counterpoint.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Although this is his declared main concern, he does 
cite examples from
chant at times when he is discussing modal assignations. Also, as has 
been
noted in the past, only five of his ninety or so examples employ more 
than
a single voice. Nonetheless, these melodies are mostly newly-composed 
for
the purpose and show&mdash;on a small scale befitting their theoretical 
utility&mdash;the way in which the principles outlined are to be applied and 
perceived.
Harold Powers (&ldquo;Tonal Types. . .&rdquo;, 432) mentions this work, doubting its
application to then current polyphony. I would again stress that my only
motive for citing passages here is to explore possible 
<i>theoretical</i>
connections between &ldquo;ficta&rdquo; and &ldquo;mode.&rdquo; It is certainly not to 
construct a
view of mode in any other way; neither is it intended to counter the 
views
of Powers (or anybody else) with regard to the work&rsquo;s authority.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Chapters 19&ndash;49 are concerned with a discussion of 
Beginning, Middle and
End. Of these chapters, Beginning is covered simply in a single chapter
(19), while End requires six chapters (44&ndash;49). By contrast, however, 
Middle
extends from chapters 20 to 43. These develop to the maximum all the
possible admixtures and permutations of modes that are possible during 
the
actual course of a composition. This section deals not only with mixed
modal categories, but also with ambitus. End, however, is treated more
fully than Beginning since irregular endings are discussed in some 
detail,
including those where moves within and without the hand (gamut) via both
recta and ficta are discussed and exemplified.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">For example, when mode 1 is mixed with mode 7 
(primo septimo
commixtus), as discussed in chapter 13, it uses the fourth-species 
diapente
with the first-species diatesseron.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">This is one of numerous instances in Tinctoris (for 
others, see ftn 15)
implying a conceptual link between Mode and Ficta, and Tinctoris brings
them into close juxtaposition on other occasions in this work.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">The use of the Bb temporarily transforms the mode 
from tritus to
tetrardus, and its presumed cancellation&mdash;when the necessity has
disappeared&mdash;restores the mode to its proper species. This Tinctoris
considers to be important.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">The two concepts are brought into the same 
evaluation.<i>Ficta</i> arises
through the need for contrapuntal consonance (i.e. B&#x266d;&ndash;F), but the 
resulting
melody is now explained as being a mixing of modes (by diatessaron
substitution). The word &ldquo;counterpoint&rdquo; refers specifically to the lower
voice which, in the example, is marked &ldquo;Contrapunctus.&rdquo; This lower voice
uses a range of A&ndash;a, and ends on D, being in mode 2. When temporarily
converted through this B&#x266d; from protus to tritus, it is regarded that the
plagal form will still operate (i.e. mode 4).</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">Earlier in Chapter 8, Tinctoris stated that modes 5 
and 6  could use
the fourth species of diatesseron, but that this should be done as 
little
as possible, and only because of unavoidable necessity (&ldquo;. . .nisi 
exigente
necessitate, fieri minime debet&rdquo;).  While it was generally assumed that
these modes admitted the Bb as a normal means of melodic adjustment, for
Tinctoris this was <i>explained</i> as a &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; of modes. While, 
therefore,
the contrapuntal need for <i>ficta</i> has placed contraints upon the 
mode
(because of the incipient tritone), it is also true that the resultant
mixing of modes 2 and 4 (which explains how the <i>melody </i> has been 
changed)
in turn has (for Tinctoris) brought constraints to bear upon the
application of <i>ficta</i> (since <i>ficta</i> here is explained as a 
mixing of
modes). Ficta and Mode are therefore (at least to Tinctoris) bound 
together
within his evaluation.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">Since Tinctoris speaks of the <i>songs</i> rather 
than their performance, I
interpret this as an observation of the manner in which unusual or
excessive voluntary (as opposed to normal or moderate <i>necessary</i>) 
mixing
of modes can effect the (at least melodic) euphony of the music. (A 
similar
rule was advanced by Tinctoris the following year as his fifth rule of
counterpoint.) If my interpretation is correct, this might echo Margaret
Bent&rsquo;s point at the end of her [25] when she states &ldquo;Wibberley and 
others
think that my Josquin example takes the application of the rules too far
for practical purposes, and I might even agree with them, but they (and 
I)
have yet to define precisely at what point and why &ssquo;the accepted rules 
of
consonance&rsquo; become unacceptable. Does Wibberley have a view on this?&rdquo; She
also stated in [21] &ldquo;. . .that there <i>can</i> be an ideal solution but 
no
perfect solution makes it very difficult to define how far is too far, 
now
that we have removed anachronistic tonal harmony, simplistic modal
restraints, and, I hope, the misapplication of modern notation as
defaults.&rdquo; What is <i>possibly</i> implied here by Tinctoris is that 
<i>he</i> may
have had a view on this. We may not quite know what that view amounted 
to
in practical terms, but since the mixing of modes outlined in his 
statement
was concerned with consonance treatment (as a &ldquo;necessity&rdquo;) it may not be
inappropriate to infer also that further &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; uses of mixed modal
types were for a similar purpose. His  <i>possible</i> caution, 
however, suggests
that there may have been a point beyond which the music, in his opinion,
may have suffered (&ldquo;cantus distonitos&rdquo;). Tintoris is not discussing what
could be described by Bent&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;simplistic modal restraints&rdquo; 
because
the modal system being outlined is both sophisticated and 
complex.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">DF(2), [3].</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">DF(2), [19].</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">I was not claiming perfection for the upper pair, as

Chapter 11. [The complete
text, together with graphics, is available on the internet at:
&ldquo;gopher://IUBVM.UCS.INDIANA.EDU:70/11/tml/16th&rdquo;.] The classical note 
names,
together with their numeric values, are also to be found in the 
hexachord
table at the beginning of Gaffurius&rsquo; <i>Practica Musicae</i> (published 
in 1496,
only a few months prior to Ockeghem&rsquo;s death). In this latter work, Book
III, Gaffurius gives a traditional survey of counterpoint with musical
examples. Although the two-voice examples are explained in two-voice 
terms
(where the harmonic result is dyadic), he moves on to examples of three-
and four-voice counterpoint where his discussion is <i>not</i> limited 
to dyadic
terms of reference. In particular, the four-voice examples are 
discussed in
terms of texture and spacing. It is true that he often discusses the
disposition of voices in relation to the Tenor voice (sometimes all the
voices are dicussed in this way), but at other times he does not. 
Neither
does he have a purely dyadic view of &ldquo;harmony,&rdquo; and he eventually went 
on
to state, as has been demonstrated, a clear difference of view between
(two-voice) &ldquo;consonance,&rdquo; and (more-than-two-voice) &ldquo;harmony.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">This was what I originally meant by the term 
&ldquo;acoustic parameters,&rdquo;
though the descriptive methodology of Gaffurius is infinitely better
formulated.  His evaluations (and calculations) seem to me evidence of
<i>triadic</i> harmonic thinking.  Dyadic harmony, realized through 
two-voice
counterpoint, is (as Bent clearly demonstrates) evinced in three voices 
by
a two-voice progression to which an accompanying voice is added. When 
the
&ldquo;consonant fourth&rdquo; occurs therefore, it is only accompanimental to the
&ldquo;primary pair&rdquo; (Bent) and does not have to be evaluated as a consonance
with its own diatesseron. As long as it forms a consonance (diapente) 
with
the lowest voice it is admissible. According to Gaffurius, however, not
only is it viewed in relation to the lowest voice, but also in relation 
to
the highest. Furthermore (and moving on beyond &ldquo;consonance&rdquo; to what
Gaffurius now calls &ldquo;harmony&rdquo;&mdash;which is different), a mathematical
relationship is seen to exist between the upper pair itself and the 
lower.
Each component, therefore, is an essential part of the harmony. Within 
each
harmonic complex, the smaller units (being the higher notes) are
progressively subtracted from the larger ones to identify the 
mathematical
(and hence acoustical) relationships. Finally, the upper relationships
themselves are subtracted from the lower ones to define the overall 
level
of consonance which characterizes the particular <i>harmony</i>. This 
(surely?)
must undeniably give a hierachical superiority to the lower notes, and
ultimately to the <i>lowest</i>. Now while this is, of course, also 
true of
two-voice counterpoint giving rise to dyadic harmony, it is <i>not</i>
necessarily the case with three-part textures which are still dyadic in
concept, but which now have an added accompanying voice.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">I will also point out (for what it is worth only) 
that Glarean&rsquo;s words
on <i>Ave Maria</i> were descriptive of the <i>harmony</i>, no mention 
being made of
the counterpoint. Further, the difference between Bent&rsquo;s resolution of 
the
disputed passage, and that of others, lies in her view that the
middle-voice component is required to exercise (but is unable, without 
the
most careful assistance, to excise) a gymnastic display of musical
schizophrenia in being simultaneously a partner to two other voices, 
each
of which belongs to a different &ldquo;primary pair.&rdquo; Her solution, if only 
for
that reason, is all the more ingenious!</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">Judd and Bent, remember, reject an explicit link 
between the two.
Further both insist that it is only the external factors (e.g. range of 
the
vocal part) that are relevant in determining the mode, since &ldquo;mode&rdquo; is 
not
an internal attribute of the musical euphony itself, but only a 
<i>label</i>
which can be assigned retrospectively as a result of such external
criteria.</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">Tinctoris,<i> Liber de Natura et Proprietate 
Tonorum</i>, (1476), Chapter 18.</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">I shall be looking only at the version preserved in 
the Medici Codex of
1518 (facsmile ed., Edward Lowinsky, &ldquo;The Medici Codex,&rdquo; <i>Monuments of
Renaissance Music</i>, V (1968), fols 125&ndash;7), where the Tenor <i>cantus 
firmus</i>
is of especial interest. The pitch of the work itself is (probably
intentionally) uncertain from this notation since there are no clefs 
(only
<i>coniuncte</i>). The Tenor, which begins on a <i>coniuncta</i>, 
delivers in
notation the standard Mode 6 version of the melody. However, the rubric
states that in performance the melody must be begun a semitone lower 
than
written. What is not spelled out, however, is that not only must this
happen, but also that the mode of the melody must be changed from 
tritus to
deuterus. Many of the intervals required will, therefore, contradict the
pragmatics of the notation (which in this sense is&mdash;to use Margaret 
Bent&rsquo;s
term&mdash;very much a &ldquo;weak default&rdquo;).</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">Speaking of &ldquo;mixed modes&rdquo; also avoids the issue of 
whether or not
prefatory <i>coniuncte</i> (i.e. signatures) do or do not transpose the 
hand as
opposed to the mode. If they transpose the hand, and (in this case) E&#x266d;
becomes a <i>recta</i> step, all this will mean is that one mixing of 
modes may
<i>still</i> yield a better result than another (because the composer 
has
presumably exercised &ldquo;extreme care&rdquo;).</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">This notion was rejected by Judd on the basis that 
<i>ficta</i> and mode
were unconnected, and that Bent&rsquo;s version did not violate her (both 
Judd&rsquo;s
and Bent&rsquo;s) view of &ldquo;mode&rdquo; as being only an external formalization of
pre-existent material. Bent also rejected this criticism on the grounds
that the way I was applying <i>my</i> concept of mode was a &ldquo;modern 
misprision,&rdquo; and that a view of mode as white-note diatonicism had little if 
anything to
do with fifteenth-century counterpoint. But I did not provide a view of
mode as being limited to &ldquo;white-note&rdquo; degrees, and argued that 
ficta/recta
adjustments could also be a means of modal articulation. This was (to
answer another of Bent&rsquo;s questions) why I introduced the term &ldquo;modal
fidelity&rdquo; as against her own (and Zager&rsquo;s) term &ldquo;modal purity.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv34" class="flyoverdiv">It is true, as Bent points out, that I did not 
previously cite Judd&rsquo;s
analysis of <i>Ave Maria</i> (<i>Music Analysis</i> 4:3 (1985), 201), 
but my reason
for not having done so will seem unclear from Bent&rsquo;s statement. This
analysis is not, as Bent claims, a &ldquo;modal analysis,&rdquo; but is a schematic
analysis which considers interrelationships between text and mode (as a
melodic framework), together with pitch-organization, tonal structure 
and
structural articulation. Further, no particular importance is attached 
to
the measures under consideration which, in the reduction, are presented
purely in their unadorned white-note form (because, as Judd has recently
demonstrated, she considers <i>ficta </i> to be on a completely 
different track
from considerations of mode). Judd does, however, claim that the
composition is written in the hypolydian mode, and even goes on to state
that some have described it (on Glarean&rsquo;s authority) as being 
hypoionian.
It is clearer to me now that her view of this attribute was limited to 
the
external features of the piece. I am, in view of Judd&rsquo;s and Bent&rsquo;s
criticism over chronology, happy to concede that it is indeed an 
example of
the hypolydian mode (which at least brings me into line with Judd&rsquo;s 
view),
particularly since it is indistinguishable (except in nomenclature) from
the hypoionian.</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">Under the assumption that it was <i>I</i> who had 
argued that such pieces
<i>should</i> be composed &ldquo;without removing the harmony from its base&rdquo; (although, as readers will recall, this was only an observation of 
Glarean
which <i>he</i> had applied to the harmony of <i>Ave Maria</i> within 
his own terms
of reference), Bent was unable to understand why I should applaud 
Josquin&rsquo;s
use of modal change (&ldquo;modulation&rdquo;) found in <i>Absalom fili mi</i> as a
&ldquo;powerful rhetorical device.&rdquo; I take seriously her caution over reading 
too
much into a composer&rsquo;s intention regarding text-setting, and will not
attempt to argue for any more extra-musical association than the 
blindingly
obvious one which seeks to express the text &ldquo;et descendam in infernum&rdquo; through a sequence of falling thirds culminating in a final chord of low
pitch which includes a B&#x266d; below gamma-ut.</div><div id="fndiv36" class="flyoverdiv">Views on pitch stability have also led to some 
serious
misunderstandings. Margaret Bent took great exception (ftn. 26) to my
inference that she viewed &ldquo;modal coherence as a close relative of pitch
stability.&rdquo; But my assumption was not drawn from the single sentence she
quoted from DF. It was arrived at on the basis of the following 
statement:
&ldquo;Did interpretations that stray from the white-note diatonicism to which
we have grown accustomed sound different or special to them? It is hard 
for
us to answer this until we have become used to thinking of sounds in a 
new
way, to doing without the conventional dividing lines we have applied
between diatonic and chromatic, <i>recta</i> and <i>ficta</i>, not to 
mention
abandoning our inherited faith in a <i>pre-tuned white-note scalar modal
chastity</i> that is open to petty violation up to an ill-defined 
point.&rdquo; (DF
pages 46&ndash;7. The italics are mine.) This followed an earlier statement
concerning the tonal movement in her Obrecht example where sho wrote 
(DT p.
35) &ldquo;Lowinsky objects that the singers would have to start the Gloria on
F&#x266d;, not that &lsquo;F&#x266d;&rsquo; at the end of the Kyrie makes the movement tonally
incoherent. The objection disappears if we renounce frequency 
stability.&rdquo;
Then, on the following page, she wrote &ldquo;Further, contemporary singers
without commitment to constant frequency, having applied their 
<i>coniuncte</i>
in bars 87&ndash;8, would then be in a position to read bars 89&ndash;96 <i>as if 
nothing
had happened</i>.&rdquo; (The italics again are mine) She objected [8] to my
imputation that she assumed that &ldquo;to begin a piece on F and end on F&#x266d; 
was
of little consequence for the singers&rdquo; but this was intended to mean no
more than her &ldquo;as if nothing had happened.&rdquo; Pitch depression is 
something I
believe she has conclusively proved through her Obrecht example, and I
cannot see anything other than a complete validation of her views on the
way <i>ficta</i> has to operate here. Our problem seems largely to be 
one of
misunderstanding what we are really saying, and Bent has clarified for 
me
now that pitch &ldquo;instability&rdquo; when it occurred did so <i>with</i> the 
awareness
of the singer. This is what I would have assumed, especially since she 
has
also pointed out to us [4] that they had no term to distinguish F from
F&#x266d;. Such a position would more credibly prescribe a greater rather 
than
a lesser need to be aware of the pitches <i>actually</i> being sung.</div><div id="fndiv37" class="flyoverdiv">Bent (22) proposes that a diminished 5th which 
contracts to a 3rd is
something that she &ldquo;could more readily tolerate.&rdquo; But this one does not 
do
so (at least not immediately, and it is equally possible to hear the
eventual E&#x266d; as merely decorative of the D to which it again immediately
falls).</div><div id="fndiv38" class="flyoverdiv">In untransposed position, this note would be the 
equivalent of F&#x266f;.</div><div id="fndiv39" class="flyoverdiv">The cadence, of which this is a component, has 
overlapped with an entry
in Voice 1 where the thematic content of the line requires this voice to
rise to the G; had the Tenor also fallen to G two octaves lower, not 
only
would the texture have been highly unsatisfactory, but also the line 
would
have had to execute an upward leap of a tenth in measure 29.</div>
