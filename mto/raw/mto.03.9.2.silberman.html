<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Post-tonal music is often a foreign language 
to undergraduates. In particular, students frequently have difficulty in 
mastering sight-singing and dictation of atonal materials due to their 
unfamiliarity. Thus, one of the goals of a course in atonal ear training is to 
familiarize students with pitch collections and rhythms that might be 
encountered in twentieth-century compositions. An effective way to accomplish 
this goal is to teach students to improvise using atonal materials, so that 
students can get simultaneous experience as both post-tonal performers and 
composers. Student improvisers must make decisions about how to use 
twentieth-century musical materials, and as a result students gain greater 
understanding of how twentieth-century composers constructed their music. </p>
<p>[2] 
Further, the National Association of Schools of Music has recently added 
improvisation to its guidelines for degrees in music. Its most recent handbook, 
in a section entitled &ldquo;Competencies Common to All Professional Baccalaureate 
Degrees in Music and to All Undergraduate Degrees Leading to Teacher 
Certification&rdquo;, suggests that students should acquire the following skills 
during their undergraduate education: </p>
<p><blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Rudimentary capacity to create 
derivative or original music both extemporaneously and in written form. </li>
    <li>The ability to compose, improvise, or both at a basic level in one or 
    more musical languages, for example, the imitation of various musical 
    styles, improvisation on pre-existing materials, the creation of original 
    compositions, experimentation with various sound sources, and manipulating 
    the common elements in non-traditional ways.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup>    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>Incorporating improvisation across the curriculum in order to teach students 
to improvise &ldquo;in one or more musical languages&rdquo;, and to &ldquo;[imitate] various 
musical styles&rdquo;, entails teaching not only tonal improvisation and jazz 
improvisation, but post-tonal improvisation as well. This article will suggest 
methods for doing so, and will situate improvisation in the aural skills 
classroom so that students can work on improvisation while improving their ears 
and their understanding of post-tonal music and compositional techniques.
</p>
<p>[3] 
Why improvisation? The real-time nature of improvisation, in contrast to 
composition, is a challenge for many students. However, students benefit from 
real-time work in the long run, because they must master the materials and 
techniques under study to such an extent that they are available at a moment&rsquo;s 
notice. Steve Larson, in an article that discusses methods for using 
improvisation in teaching about common-practice tonality, writes &ldquo;knowing facts 
about music <nobr>. . .</nobr> is only useful if those facts can be brought to bear as quickly as 
the musical situation <nobr>. . .</nobr> requires. Improvisation not only requires that those 
skills be accessible, but also makes them available.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p>[4] Kate Covington makes the case for 
improvisation in aural training as follows: &ldquo;Improvisation involves active 
learning, or learning by doing <nobr>. . .</nobr> By necessity, improvisation occurs in 
&lsquo;real-world&rsquo; contexts which possess more similarities to career activities and 
professional needs than sitting at a desk and responding with paper and 
pencil.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> She goes on to elaborate on the real-world nature of improvisation 
as opposed to more conventional classroom activities: &ldquo;A <nobr>. . .</nobr> problem with 
traditional aural pedagogy is that it primarily addresses aspects of pitch and 
rhythm, to the virtual exclusion of other music parameters, such as texture, 
timbre, dynamics, and articulation. Improvisation <nobr>. . .</nobr> demands that the 
practitioner consider and integrate these other dimensions into existing and 
developing concepts of pitch and rhythm.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>
<p>[5] There have 
been few cognition experiments that involve improvisation, but one study 
conducted in Hungary in the 1970s does suggest that improvisation can be a good 
test of performers&rsquo; understanding of musical structure.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Researchers Maria Sagi and Ivan Vitanyi asked non-musicians to perform several tasks, including 
improvising melodies over chord progressions and improvising continuations of 
melodic fragments. They found that the non-musicians were good at improvising 
when the given chord progressions or melodic fragments were familiar. Subjects 
were best at improvising melodies over common practice chord progressions and 
over modal chord progressions found in Hungarian folk music, and were best at 
continuing melodic fragments that were diatonic or pentatonic. Chromatic 
harmonies and melodic fragments made of synthetic scales gave the subjects much 
more trouble. Sagi and Vitanyi concluded that people can improvise only with 
materials that they understand. This conclusion has important ramifications for 
using improvisation to teach post-tonal music. It suggests that once students 
have learned to improvise successfully with post-tonal materials, they have 
internalized a sort of post-tonal style, and made that style a part of their 
musical vocabulary. Hence, they are a step closer to understanding post-tonal 
music.
</p>
<p>[6] Teaching post-tonal improvisation, and 
then using it in a music theory or aural skills class, can be difficult. There 
are comparatively few method books in post-tonal improvisation, and no 
established pedagogy. In contrast, there are probably hundreds, if not 
thousands, of method books on tonal improvisation, mostly jazz, with a smaller 
selection of works in the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; music tradition for organists and continuo 
players. There are even a few tonal improvisation books and articles written for 
use in the music theory curriculum, such as Wittlich and Martin&rsquo;s <i>Tonal Harmony 
for the Keyboard,</i> Berkowitz&rsquo;s <i>Improvisation Through Keyboard Harmony,</i> and the 
Larson and Covington articles cited above.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
Tonal improvisation is easily adapted for use in classroom settings. Tonal music 
has clearly defined rules and a well-established syntax, and wrong notes stick 
out like sore thumbs, allowing improvisations to be evaluated relatively easily.

<p>[7] 
Post-tonal improvisation is quite different. How can one teach and then evaluate 
what seems to be an &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; style of improvisation, without 
pre-established chord progressions, melodies, or forms? <b>Example 1</b> shows an 
analysis, based on analyses by Steven Block and Tom Darter, of a brief section 
of an improvisation by Cecil Taylor, which will suggest some answers to this 
question.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup><sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
This passage is from an improvisation entitled &ldquo;Air Above Mountains (Buildings 
Within)&rdquo;, and is from the CD <i>Air Above Mountains.</i><sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
Taylor juxtaposes three types of collections of notes &mdash; chromatic, represented 
by set classes [0123] and [01234], whole tone, represented by set classes [026], 
[0248], and [02468], and diatonic, represented by set class [027]. Taylor 
usually plays the same pitch classes when each collection returns. Further, this 
whole passage can be considered to be a giant expansion of the initial chromatic 
motive, containing pitch classes <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, D, <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>, and E, labeled &ldquo;X&rdquo;. &ldquo;X&rdquo; reappears 
twice, but more significantly comprises the upper and lower bounds of later 
collections, which have E or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> as highest notes, and D or <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> as lowest notes, 
as shown by the stems with flags. The one exception, the high F at the end of 
the second system, may be a finger slip, as there is an E directly below it.</p>
<p>[8] Taylor&rsquo;s improvisation suggests three 
strategies for structuring a post-tonal improvisation, each suitable for 
classroom use &mdash; intervals (in this case the progression from half steps to 
whole steps to perfect fifths), pitch class sets (in this case the juxtaposition 
of chromatic sets with whole tone and quintal harmonies), and scales (in this 
case the use of chromatic, whole tone, and diatonic scales as sources from which 
pitches can be selected). These topics are shown below in a brief survey of 
pitch-related subjects presented in post-tonal music theory textbooks.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Each 
listing of these topics is preceded by an asterisk.

<p>[9] Joseph Straus&rsquo;s text has chapters on 
intervals, pitch-class sets, and referential collections (in other words, 
scales). Stefan Kostka&rsquo;s text also has chapters on pitch class sets, which he 
calls &ldquo;chords and simultaneities,&rdquo; and scales. Kent Williams&rsquo;s text has sections 
on intervals and set types (in other words, pitch class sets), and covers scales 
in a variety of different chapters.
</p>
<p>[10] The above list demonstrates that these 
topics are commonly presented in textbooks. These textbooks could be used as 
supplementary material for a course unit on post-tonal improvisation. Likewise, 
improvisations built on intervals, pitch class sets, and/or scales, could easily 
be introduced in a course using any of the above texts. The same pitch-related 
topics appear in three sight-singing and ear training texts that deal with 
twentieth-century music, shown below.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Again, these textbooks could be used 
to supplement instruction in improvisation, or improvisation could be introduced 
in a course using any of these books. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Modus Novus</i> by Lars Edlund </p>
<ul>
  <li>*Sight-singing melodies by interval content </li>
  <li>*Hearing chords by interval 
content </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Sight-Singing: Pitch, Interval, Rhythm</i> by Samuel Adler </p>

<ul>
  <li>*Dyads [intervals] </li>
  <li>*Chords </li>
  <li>Processes (T, I, R, invariance, contour relations) </li>
</ul>
<p>[11] Both the Edlund and Adler texts teach 
students to sightsing melodies by interval content, and are organized 
accordingly &mdash; melodies made up of seconds are introduced first, then melodies 
made up of thirds, then fourths, etc. These books do the same thing with pitch 
class sets, introducing pitch class sets made of seconds, then thirds, then 
fourths, etc. The Friedmann text, which is more of an aural analysis book than a 
sightsinging book, first has listening exercises comprised of intervals, then 
proceeds to pitch class sets. The Adler text alone has a section on singing 
twentieth-century scales. </p>
<p>[12] Intervals, pitch class sets, and scales have 
three things in common that make them good building blocks for student 
improvisations. 1. They&rsquo;re easy to remember, at least compared to, say, 
remembering a 12-tone row. Thus, they&rsquo;re easily repeated, so that, for example, 
an improvisation could be structured around one chord or one interval. 2. They 
are static &mdash; it&rsquo;s easier at first to improvise with things instead of with 
processes. 3. They lend themselves well to transposition and inversion, two 
important operations that students will encounter throughout their music theory 
education. In contrast, a difficult improvisation might be to improvise a serial 
composition using 12-tone rows, which meets only one of these three 
requirements, that of transposition and inversion. Surprisingly, there is a book 
by Meyer Kupferman called <i>Atonal Jazz </i>that presents a method for learning to 
play 12-tone jazz improvisations.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
An improvisation of that nature would be beyond the abilities of most performers 
without extensive study.</p>
<p>[13] Ed Sarath, in an 
article in the <i>Journal of Music Theory,</i> gives some cognitive justification for 
the use of small building blocks in improvisation, as opposed to global 
processes. Sarath distinguishes between two types of time, one experienced by an 
improviser, and one experienced by a composer. Sarath writes &ldquo;<nobr>. . .</nobr>the improviser 
experiences time in an inner-directed, or &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; manner, where the present 
is heightened and the past and future are perceptually subordinated. I contrast 
inner-directed conception with the &lsquo;expanding&rsquo; temporality of the composer, 
where temporal projection may be conceived from any moment in a work to past and 
future time coordinates.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
Since the improviser focuses on the present, any longer-range structure will be 
difficult to put into effect, and thus smaller events are a better match with 
the improvisational process.</p>
<p>[14] So far, criteria for selecting pitch materials only have been discussed. 
What about rhythm and meter? I&rsquo;ve found that, especially in the beginning, it&rsquo;s 
all that students can do to master the pitch dimension of improvisation. 
Therefore, I start off by allowing them to perform improvisations without a 
pulse or meter, and without rhythmic requirements. I gradually introduce pulse 
into their improvisation assignments, and eventually meter. Jeff Pressing, in an 
article in <i>Music Perception,</i> concludes that the use of a pulse causes 
improvisations to be more motivically unified than improvisations without a 
pulse.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> This has also been my 
experience, and since I want students to work with intervallic, pitch class set, 
and rhythmic motives, I make sure to require a pulse as my students become more 
comfortable with improvisation. </p>
<p>[15] In selecting 
rhythmic material, I try to stick to the first two of my requirements for 
improvisation building blocks &mdash; a building block should be easy to remember, 
and a thing instead of a process. Topics presented in three rhythm textbooks 
that have sections on twentieth-century rhythm and meter are shown below.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> 
Topics that appear in all three books are preceded by asterisks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Studying Rhythm</i> by Anne Hall </p>

  <li>*Meters with unequal beats </li>
  <li>Quintuple 
meter </li>
  <li>Quintuplets </li>

</ul>

  <li>*Changing meters </li>
  <li>*Meters with unequal beats </li>
  <li>Metric modulation</li>
  <li>Polymeter </li>
  <li>Ametric music</li>
</ul>
<p>[16] The topics common to all three books are 
changing meters and meters with unequal beats. One of them meets these criteria 
&mdash; meters with unequal beats &mdash; and the other, changing meters, doesn&rsquo;t. Short 
rhythmic figures or motives, for example quintuplets or cross rhythms, also make 
good subjects for improvisation.</p>
<p>[17] As just discussed, one option in teaching improvisation is to start with 
pitch and add rhythm later. Another option is to do the opposite and have 
students start improvising using rhythm alone, without pitch, and then gradually 
add pitch elements.</p>
<p>[18] How does one start students 
improvising? Many students already have experience with improvisation, 
particularly those who have a background in jazz, rock, or folk music, or in 
composition. Also, some students have improvised with tonal materials in aural 
skills and/or music theory classes, which is an excellent preparation for later 
work with post-tonal materials. However, many students have never improvised, 
and may feel uncomfortable with improvisation.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup>  Sample beginning exercises are shown below. Some are my own, some are by others, 
and all gently ease students into improvisation, without expecting much from 
them at the beginning. What all these exercises have in common is that it is 
impossible for people performing them to play wrong notes. This is important 
because many students&rsquo; resistance to improvisation comes from stage fright &mdash; 
fear of playing a wrong note, fear of the audience not liking them, etc. &mdash; so I 
start with activities in which it is impossible to sound like a virtuoso, and 
there is little risk of failure. </p>
<ul>
  <li>One note (W.A. Mathieu) 
- Performers sit in a circle. One person starts by playing only one note of any 
pitch, duration, and volume. The next person does the same, as does the next, 
and single notes go around the circle to form a melody. </li>
  <li>Two notes - Same as 
One Note, but performers now play an interval. </li>
  <li>Ten notes - Same as One Note, but now performers must play 10 notes, no 
  more, no less. Can each make his or her own melody? Can each respond to the 
  melody that precedes his or hers? </li>
  <li>Ostinato exercise (David Darling) - Performers sit in a circle. One person 
starts by playing an ostinato (pitch and rhythm). The next person joins with 
another ostinato that fits with the first one. When the third person enters, the 
first person drops out. The ostinato duet goes around the circle. </li>
  <li>Playing 
contours (Roger Dean) - Performer(s) play an improvisation based on shape. The 
shape can be realized as a pitch, a rhythm, or anything else (dynamics, 
register, density, etc.). </li>
  <li>Repeated rhythmic motive (David Darling) - Play any 
pitches using a repeated rhythmic ostinato &mdash; can be Baroque dance figure, for 
example (sarabande, etc.). </li>
  <li>Playing your name (John Buccheri) - Performers each play a musical 
  fragment that matches the rhythm and inflection of his or her name.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>[19] I&rsquo;ll describe a couple of these exercises in 
more detail. I always start with &ldquo;One Note&rdquo;, an exercise developed by the 
pianist W.A. Mathieu. Students sit in a circle. One person starts by playing or 
singing just one note of any pitch, length, and volume. The person seated next 
to him or her then also plays just one note, again of any pitch, length, and 
volume. The person seated next to that person does the same thing, and in this 
fashion notes travel around and around the circle. Eventually some sort of 
melody emerges, and students start thinking and experimenting with ideas of 
continuation and interruption. We then proceed to &ldquo;Two Notes&rdquo;, which works the 
same way, except that participants can play or sing just two notes. This gets 
students to think about intervals &mdash; which are easy or hard to sing or play, 
which sound or don&rsquo;t sound good to them, which go together, which don&rsquo;t, etc. 
</p>
<p>[20] Further, it&rsquo;s important for instructors to demonstrate improvisation 
exercises first, so that students can hear a possible result for each exercise. 
This also helps &ldquo;break the ice,&rdquo; particularly in situations in which 
improvisation is new for students. Thus, any instructor incorporating 
improvisation into his or her classroom should improvise regularly, both in the 
practice room and in front of students. Instructors with limited experience in 
improvisation can benefit by working through the exercises in the books listed 
in footnote 17 above. </p>
<p>[21] I&rsquo;ll now describe how I implemented the foregoing 
ideas. During the fall semester of 1999, I taught an advanced atonal aural 
skills course at Oberlin Conservatory. Most of the students in the course were 
performance majors, with a few music education or composition majors, and most 
were juniors. This course was not required of all students at Oberlin, only 
those who had passed a placement exam and had been exempted from taking earlier 
aural skills classes. As a result, students in this course had above-average 
skills. I do, however, believe that the methods described in this article would 
work well with other student populations. </p>
<p>[22] Improvisation was introduced after fall break, the first half of the 
semester having been devoted to more conventional activities. Students were 
presented with five improvisation exercises of increasing difficulty at a rate 
of one a week. The first improvisation exercise, which was assigned for 
homework, is shown below. </p>
<p>Form: ABA' <br>
Length: 30 seconds to one minute <br>
Directions: The A and A' sections use this contour 21043. The B section uses its 
inversion, 23401 <br>
Contour can represent anything - notes, motives, phrases, durations, dynamics, 
register, etc. </p>
<p>[23] 
This exercise is designed to give students a taste of improvisation without 
demanding too much of them. The improvisation has a form &mdash; ABA &mdash; and a length 
&mdash; 30 seconds to one minute. Students were asked to improvise using one contour 
only, and the sections differ in that the middle section uses the inversion of 
the contour. The contour can represent anything &mdash; pitches, rhythms, dynamics, 
etc. &mdash; so that the assignment becomes very flexible. Some students are more 
comfortable with rhythm than with pitch, or with other parameters entirely, and 
for the first assignment I wanted them to be comfortable. Students could sing, 
perform on their main instrument, or play the piano if piano was not their main 
instrument. As a homework assignment, they were asked to improvise a short work 
every day for a week, following these directions. They were not allowed to write 
anything down, or to memorize anything other than the directions, so this 
assignment did not turn into a notated or memorized composition. After a week of 
practice, I selected several students in class to perform for a grade. I won&rsquo;t 
say much about grading, except that I based my grade primarily on whether or not 
the students could follow the directions and do everything I asked of them in 
their improvisations. </p>
<p>[24] The next improvisation exercise, which is more 
specific in terms of pitch content, is shown below. </p>
<p>Form: ABA' <br>
Length: 30 
seconds to one minute <br>
Directions: The A section should consist primarily (but 
not exclusively) of a trichord and its transpositions. Choose from 013, 014, 
015, 016, 025, 026. You can use this trichord as a harmony, as a melody, or as 
both. You may also use intervals from that trichord, or larger chords or 
melodies that contain it. The B section should consist primarily of another 
trichord. Use any except what you used in the A section and 037. The A' section 
should be a variation of the A section, except that the trichord used in the A 
section should be used here in inversion. <br>
Listeners: must identify each trichord 
used by the performer. </p>
<p>[25] Form and length are the same as exercise one, but 
now the students were required to base their pitch structure on trichords. 
Students were provided with a list of trichords from which to choose for the A 
section. Students could use the trichords as verticalities if they played a 
chordal instrument, or as melodies or motives if they did not, and could 
transpose them to as many pitch levels as they would like. In order to have more 
flexibility, students were allowed to use intervals from the trichords, or 
larger chords or melodies of which their trichord was a subset. Students were 
asked to use a different trichord for the B section. The A' section used the 
same trichord as the A section but in inversion. Note that in this exercise, as 
in all the succeeding ones, there is an assignment for the listeners, who must 
identify the trichords used by the performer in each section. </p>
<p>[26] The third 
improvisation exercise is shown below. </p>
<p>Form: Variation form (A A' A'') <br>
Length: 
30 seconds to one minute <br>
Directions: Consider the following relationships: 
contrast, complementation, conflict. Choose two trichords and improvise a piece 
of music that uses them in one of the relationships. One of the trichords must 
be in inversion. Your relationship between the trichords should stay the same in 
each variation. <br>
Listeners: must identify the two trichords, and the 
relationship. </p>
<p>[27] Like the second exercise, the third exercise uses trichords 
but has a new form &mdash; variation form &mdash; and also has directions for narrative 
content. I wanted students to start thinking more about the emotional or 
narrative aspect of their improvisations. They were asked to select a 
relationship and illustrate it with two trichords. The relationships were 
contrast, complementation, and conflict. I hoped that this would make students 
think about things such as which trichords sounded good together, which didn&rsquo;t 
sound good together, and which might be related and why. Again, the listeners 
were asked to identify the trichords, and also the relationship.</p>
<p>[28] The fourth 
improvisation exercise is shown below. </p>
<p>Form: binary (AB) <br>
Length: 30 seconds to 
one minute <br>
Directions: The A section should use any trichord except 037 and 
should have a steady tempo and a consistent meter. You will then abruptly switch 
to the B section, which should have a tempo relationship with the A section of 
either 1:2, 2:1, 2:3, or 3:2. The B section should use any of the tetrachords 
we&rsquo;ve studied in class (0123, 0246, 0158, 0369, 0258, 0358, or 0148). <br>
Listeners: 
must identify the trichord, the tetrachord, and the tempo relationship. </p>
<p>[29] 
Here metric requirements were introduced. The improvisation was required to have 
a steady pulse, and was in two sections whose tempos were related by the tempo 
proportions we had studied and performed in class. The first section was based 
on a trichord, and the second on a tetrachord. Listeners were asked to identify 
the trichord and tetrachord used, and the relationship between the two tempos. 
</p>
<p>[30] The fifth and final improvisation exercise is shown below. </p>
<p>Form: ABA' 
<br>
Length: 30 seconds to one minute <br>
Directions: The A section will use any tetrachord from this list: 0257, 0347, 0237, 0167, 0268, 0134, 0235. The B 
section will use any tetrachord from this list: 0123, 0147, 0158, 0258, 0358, 
0369. The A' section will use another trichord from the A section list. Both the 
A and A' sections will use accents in unusual places in the manner of Ruth 
Crawford Seeger&rsquo;s <i>Piano Study in Mixed Accents.</i> <br>
Listeners: must identify the tetrachords used. </p>
<p>[31] Like the second improvisation exercise, the fifth 
improvisation exercise is also in ternary form, with the B section using a pitch 
class set different from that in the A section, and the A' section using an 
inversion of the pitch class set used in the A section. Unlike the second 
exercise, the fifth exercise uses tetrachords. Students also were asked to use 
an accent structure like that in Ruth Crawford Seeger&rsquo;s <i>Piano Study in Mixed 
Accents.</i> Seeger&rsquo;s composition is in steady sixteenth notes, but has accents 
that group the sixteenths into anything but consistent groups of four.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>[32] In addition to the improvisation exercises 
for performance, students were given listening assignments to familiarize them 
with the works of well known improvisers, and with different styles and 
techniques of improvisation. They were asked to listen to excerpts from the 
following recordings: <i>Aardvark Steps Out,</i> by the free jazz big band Aardvark; 
<i>Heibel, </i>by the Willem Breuker Kollektief with Greetje Bijma, one of the few 
free improvisers who is a vocalist; and <i>Deep Listening, </i>by Pauline Oliveros, 
one of the foremost figures in free improvisation.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> Certainly, many other 
recordings could have been chosen.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>
<p>[33] I will now discuss transcriptions of 
improvisations by two students who took the course described above.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Both 
improvisations are realizations of the second improvisation exercise above. Both 
of the performers played melody instruments, and so used the trichords as 
melodies, not as harmonies, and also used intervals from the trichords.</p>


<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b>. Transcription of student improvisation by Michael Reavey</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="silberman_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="silberman_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[34] <b>Example 2</b> shows the first transcription.
<b>Soundfile 1</b> is the audio for this improvisation. The performer, Michael Reavey, 
was a senior at the time of the recording, and took my course as a junior. He 
was a trumpet performance and music education major, and had some experience 
playing jazz. In this transcription, as well as the next one, Tn set classes 
have been used for trichord labels instead of the more familiar Tn/TnI set 
classes so that the difference between a trichord and its inversion can be 
shown. The trichords Michael selected are listed at the top of Example 2. He 
used trichord 014 for the A section, 012 for the B section, and 034, the 
inversion of 014, for the A' section. Instances of each trichord are labeled on 
the transcription. </p>
<p>[35] In addition to using the trichords correctly, Michael 
also made use of intervals from the trichords. In the A and A' sections there 
are a number of major sixths, labeled on the score as &ldquo;M6th&rdquo;. The major sixth is 
a member of interval class 3, one of the intervals in the 014 trichord. Since 
Michael realized interval class 3 as a minor third each time he played an 014 
trichord, the major sixths provided some much needed variety while staying 
within the intervallic constraints of the improvisation. Another interesting 
feature is the use of the tritone to articulate phrase or section endings. This 
occurred at the end of the second phrase, and also at the end of the B section. 
Michael also used a pitch center of sorts &mdash; the improvisation begins and ends 
on C, and many phrases begin or end on C, E, or G. This C major triad seems 
somewhat out of place in an atonal improvisation, but it is evidence that 
Michael was able to develop an overall structure. In addition, Michael developed 
rhythmic motives for each section of the work without any prompting from the 
directions. Rhythms in the first and third sections consisted of mostly quarter 
and eighth notes, while 16th notes appeared in the B section. The rhythmic 
motive from the A section, a long note followed by two short notes, appeared in 
retrograde in the A' section as two short notes followed by a long note. </p>
<p>[36] 
After the recording, each student was asked to comment on what he thought of 
using improvisation like this in our aural skills class. Michael commented: 
&ldquo;When I play jazz, [20th century techniques] can open up another way to look at 
things. [Learning these techniques] set a standard for this sort of 
improvisation when I hear it played. Before, I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Now I 
have a better ear towards it.&rdquo; It is significant that Michael mentioned having a 
better ear, and further, that he was able to use his improved understanding in 
his performing and listening. </p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b>. Transcription of student improvisation by Dave Reminick</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="silberman_examples.php?id=2&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 3 thumbnail" src="silberman_ex3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[37] <b>Example 3</b> shows a transcription of the second 
improvisation. <b>Soundfile 2</b> is the audio example. The performer, Dave Reminick, 
was also a senior at the time of the recording, and took the course as a junior. 
He was a &ldquo;classical&rdquo; saxophone performance major, and was an experienced 
performer of post-tonal improvisation. The trichords he selected for each 
section are listed at the top of the example. </p>
<p>[38] Dave mixed up a few of the trichords, which occasionally appeared in the wrong section. 056, which is 
supposed to be in the A' section only, was also in the A section.  These minor 
errors, however, are entirely offset by the musicality and sophistication of 
this improvisation, shown particularly by the skillful embedding of multiple 
instances of the same trichord in just a few notes. One example of this is the 
opening five notes of the improvisation, labeled motive &ldquo;M&rdquo;. &ldquo;M&rdquo; 
also returned transposed to announce the beginning of the A' section. An analysis of motive &ldquo;M&rdquo; is shown in Example 3 beneath the score. 
Motive &ldquo;M&rdquo; is a member of set class [0167], a set class that is saturated with 
the 016 trichord, which can be made from any three of its notes. Like Michael, 
Dave created rhythmic motives for each section of the work without any prompting 
from the directions. In contrast to Michael, Dave experimented more with 
register. Each section of Dave&rsquo;s improvisation had a characteristic register, 
and these registers were joined by the descent to the low <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> at the end. </p>
<p>[39] 
Dave commented: &ldquo;I felt like [these exercises] gave me a chance to actually do 
some hands-on work with the concept of trichords, and actually work with them in 
real-time and try to link ideas together and think with them, and I just felt 
like it promoted a better understanding.&rdquo; I had a bit more time to talk with 
Dave, and I&rsquo;ve included another comment from him that I think is revealing. Dave 
was describing a new composition he had heard. He said, &ldquo;[The composer] was 
basically using the same trichord over and over again. [I said] &lsquo;016, what&rsquo;s 
going on here, it&rsquo;s all over the place.&rsquo; The ear picks up quicker.&rdquo; Like 
Michael, Dave mentioned his ear, and had developed good enough ears to identify 
trichords in others&rsquo; compositions. He also mentioned having a better 
understanding of twentieth century music, which is of course the ultimate goal 
of post-tonal ear training. </p>
<p>[40] In summary, I have presented an approach that 
combines ear training in 20th century music with improvisation, specifically 
improvisation that is based on 20th century pitch collections and the intervals 
that they contain. Recorded student improvisations suggest that not only can 
undergraduates improvise successfully with these constraints, but that the 
improvisations can strengthen the ears and minds of the performers, as evidenced 
by student comments. </p>
<p>[41] I&rsquo;ll conclude by quoting the organist and 
improvisation specialist Gerre Hancock, who sums up my belief about the value of 
improvisation. &ldquo;[T]he chief reason to learn improvisation is simply that our 
musical personalities are incomplete and underdeveloped if we are unable to 
express ourselves in a spontaneous fashion. The ability to improvise is central 
to our musicianship; without it, musicians are simply not &lsquo;compleat&rsquo;.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>

Like Sarath quoted above, Pressing distinguishes between object memory (small building blocks) and process memory (global processes). In contrast to Sarath, Pressing makes no claim that one is more appropriate to improvisation than the other, but suggests that the improviser should develop both types of memory. See Jeff Pressing, &ldquo;Cognitive Processes in Improvisation,&rdquo; in <i>Cognitive Processes in the Perception of Art,</i> ed. by W. Ray Crozier and Antony Chapman, Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1984: 345&ndash;363. Elsewhere, Pressing develops detailed models of the improvisational process that incorporate findings from cognitive science and neuroscience, along with insights gained from studies of improvising musicians and improvisation method books. See Jeff Pressing, &ldquo;Improvising: Methods and Models,&rdquo; in <i>Generative Processes in Music,</i> ed. by John Sloboda, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988: 129&ndash;178; and Jeff Pressing, &ldquo;Psychological Constraints on Improvisational Expertise and Communication,&rdquo; in <i>In the Course of Performance,</i> ed. by Bruno Nettl and Melinda Russell, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998: 41&ndash;67.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> Anne Carothers Hall, <i>Studying Rhythm,</i> 2nd edition, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1998; Samuel Adler, <i>Sight-Singing: Pitch, Interval, Rhythm,</i> 2nd edition, New York: Norton, 1997; Daniel Kazez, <i>Rhythm Reading, </i>2nd edition, New York: Norton, 1997.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> For more information about student reactions to improvisation, see George Lewis, &ldquo;Teaching Improvised Music: An Ethnographic Memoir,&rdquo; in <i>Arcana: Musicians on Music, </i>ed. by John Zorn, New York: Granary Books, 2000: 78&ndash;109.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> The exercises above come from the following books and article, all of which contain valuable improvisation exercises, from beginning to advanced levels: David Darling and Bonnie Insull, <i>Return to Child,</i> 3rd edition, Goshen, CT: Music for People, 1997; Roger Dean, <i>Creative Improvisation: Jazz, Contemporary Music and Beyond, </i>Milton Keynes, UK: Open University Press, 1989; W.A. Mathieu <i>The Listening Book, </i>Boston: Shambhala Publications, 1991; John Buccheri, &ldquo;Finding Your Own Music - A Case for Free Improvisation,&rdquo; <i>College Music Society Newsletter,</i> September 2002. Another book that easily could be adapted for music theory or aural skills courses, because it gives detailed instructions about working with pitch, is Gerre Hancock, <i>Improvising: How to Master the Art, </i>Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. At the other end of the spectrum are two books that list improvisation exercises for children that require little instrumental expertise, which could be used for warmup or introductory activities: Trevor Wishart, <i>Sounds Fun: A Book of Musical Games,</i> SCDC Publications, 1975; and Trevor Wishart, <i>Sounds Fun 2: A Second Book of Musical Games, </i>London: Universal Edition, 1977. The composer Bruce Adolphe has developed exercises that are more conceptual (for example, improvising in the style of a well-known composer, thinking of a sentence and then &ldquo;playing&rdquo; it on an instrument, etc.) that could be used in a variety of situations. See Bruce Adolphe, <i>The Mind&rsquo;s Ear,</i> St. Louis: MMB Music, 1991. Saxophonist Larry Ochs discusses devices for structuring improvisations for multiple performers in Larry Ochs, &ldquo;Devices and Strategies for Structured Improvisation,&rdquo; in <i>Arcana: Musicians on Music,</i> ed. by John Zorn, New York: Granary Books, 2000: 325&ndash;335. Two sight-singing/ear training textbooks that also contain post-tonal improvisation exercises are Friedmann, <i>Ear Training for Twentieth-Century Music,</i> and Vernon Kliewer, <i>Music Reading: A Comprehensive Approach,</i> Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1973.
