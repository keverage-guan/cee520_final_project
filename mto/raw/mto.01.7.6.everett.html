<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p><p><b>You want the bad news first?</b></p>
<p>[1] Poor Richard. He wants writers on popular music to address the topic from 
what he sees as the single viable perspective. He looks at what is offered by many 
American analysts, with their emphasis on the inner tonal relationships of a song 
or group of songs, and he finds the approach both doctrinaire (because it is based 
on what he asserts to be the uncritical adoption of &ldquo;formalist&rdquo; systems that had 
been created to clarify the workings of music of a different sort) and inadequate 
(due to its failure to consider the entirety of the music&rsquo;s social context). He 
turns to the cultural-studies sociologists, and admires their consumer-based interest 
in gesture and dance steps but is embarrassed by their lack of sophistication in 
parsing a musical text. He then announces that in order to pretend to any validity 
at all, the only proper approach in pop-music scholarship is to synthesize the two 
goals in every piece of published research. He reasons that &ldquo;musical meaning cannot 
be detached from the discursive, social and institutional frameworks which surround, 
mediate, and (yes) produce it.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Middleton is not alone 
in this argument, but is supported by a number of the book&rsquo;s contributors. Thus, 
Philip Tagg: &ldquo;no analysis of musical discourse can be considered complete without 
consideration of social, psychological, visual, gestural, ritual, technical, historical, 
economic, and linguistic aspects relevant to the genre, function, style, (re-)performance 
situation, and listening attitude connected with the sound event being studied.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
Thus, Alf Bj&ouml;rnberg: &ldquo;It is a fact that pop and rock music have always been heavily 
infused with socially determined meaning such that an autonomous musical aesthetics 
appears clearly insufficient to explain their significance.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> 
In his own chapter, Middleton grasps at cultural studies, linguistics, genetic theory, 
and even the electro-chemical nature of neural circuits to explain the nature of 
a gesture, because for him meaning is to be found not among musical relations but 
in the music&rsquo;s relationship to its surroundings.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> To this reviewer, such an entanglement 
of music with its context seems almost less &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; than ever, in an age when 
a reference to the text of <i>Abbey Road</i> should mean exactly the same thing 
to everyone the world over&mdash;the collection of 478.5 megabytes appearing on a compact 
disc that contains in every case the same stereo mix of a recording fixed in 1969. 
This sort of musical text, common to most popular-music compositions of the past 
fifty years, can be studied as an independent unit much more easily than could a 
Mozart sonata, which exists only in a general notational roadmap suggestive of many 
possible valid and interesting tangible interpretations.</p>
<p>[2] Just as he gets comfortable advocating a balance of the musical and the sociological, 
in the thumbnail history of approaches to popular music featured in his Introduction, 
along comes the post-modern discourse-edifying critic, and a befuddled Richard now 
feels that his previous interdisciplinary prescription is inadequate unless it is 
also colored by an attractive political stance, hopefully one embracing a Marxist 
or a sexual-politic perspective. So, according to his 
current view, every scholarly attempt to discuss popular song must present research 
involving music-analytical work, sociological study, and political criticism&mdash;and 
all from the approved viewpoint. </p>
<p>[3] Part of the reason for Richard&rsquo;s conundrum is the odd-bedfellows nature of 
popular-music scholarship, with its mix of academic discipline and vernacular repertoire. 
A second aspect of the problem is posed simply by the immaturity of the field of 
popular music studies, with many voices from different backgrounds yearning to be 
heard. A third is due to the manifold tonal systems present in popular music, some 
no different from those of 200 years ago, others hardly related at all, and still 
others combining aspects from both of these extremes. But the dominant problem as 
articulated and exemplified in <i>Reading Pop</i> is the editor&rsquo;s own great urge 
to indoctrinate. In our chiefly American discourse, I like to think that different 
views are encouraged, that we learn from complementary approaches, that we are free 
to design the scope as well as the objects, systems, and methods of our investigations 
as we deem appropriate, and that no one is required to &ldquo;do it all,&rdquo; to reflect in 
their own work that of everyone else within the field&mdash;let alone those in tangential 
fields. But Richard would not be comfortable with such flexibility and freedom. 
Whereas other scholars desire to be heard and understood, he asks to set the interdisciplinary 
agenda for everyone else. No matter that scholarship has traditionally been a domain 
that values highly developed expertise in a fairly circumscribed area of specialization. 
Perhaps because recent popular music represents rebellion, academic tradition is 
to be thrown on its head! We must crown a new leader&mdash;let&rsquo;s see <nobr>. . .</nobr> who is so 
prominent as to have been a founding editor of the journal, <i>Popular Music</i>, 
to have authored a couple of pioneering books in the area (<i>Pop Music and the 
Blues</i> [1972] and <i>Studying Popular Music </i>[1990]), to have earned the professional respect of many readers and other devotees, and to have proclaimed 
the one proper direction for scholarly inquiry? To repeat a line from the Who that 
John Covach has used in a related analogy elsewhere, &ldquo;Meet the new boss, same as 
the old boss.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>
<p>[4] I applaud Middleton&rsquo;s interests in the interdisciplinary 
and the intertextual. I would be quite impressed and would be mighty grateful to 
find a single essay that skillfully weaves deep and convincing observations in such 
an interesting combination of disciplines as thought necessary by Richard Middleton. 
(In fact, the similar but smaller-scale call for a balance of rigor and imagination, 
of structural and hermeneutic approaches, is certainly the most important contribution 
to emerge from the influential work of contributor Philip Tagg.)<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> 
But all of the chapters in this volume, to varying degrees, fall short of such a 
standard, often because of weaknesses in interest or skill in musical matters, those 
matters that the readership of <i>Music Theory Online</i> would likely consider 
the root of the music-sociology-politics triad. Umberto Fiori, for example, does 
ask the necessary post-Bakhtin question &ldquo;Who is <i>really</i> speaking?,&rdquo; a seemingly 
obligatory search for authorial voice that has been worked into a number of the 
book&rsquo;s studies, but there is no mention of music in his essay on Peter Gabriel.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Musical issues in John Moore&rsquo;s 35-page cultural study of torch singers are restricted 
to a few paragraphs characterizing vocal production in vague terms.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Richard Leppert and George Lipsitz collaborate on a 
psychological study of Hank Williams&rsquo;s relationship to his culture that boasts a 
total of two lines of musical insight.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> (These chapters appear in a book whose 
jacket blurb claims it to be &ldquo;the first substantial anthology to focus on the musical 
&lsquo;texts&rsquo;.&rdquo;) But I will not take these or other authors to task for not meeting such 
an impossible goal. Instead, I will mention a few of the strengths apparent here 
and there from which readers may benefit. But first, I wish to continue my analysis 
of the book&rsquo;s central thrust as shaped by the editor. </p>
<p>[5] Middleton, if he can be judged against normal editorial obligations, shows 
throughout this book that he possesses little skill in 
working with aspects of musical structure. Given his own training (as a one-time 
student of Wilfrid Mellers at York University), Middleton cannot be expected to 
possess much of a background in Schenkerian analysis. But elsewhere, he summarizes 
with apparent ease what he believes to be the basis of the Schenkerian method, betraying 
a shallow and mistaken understanding (one heavily invested in the tree-branching 
&ldquo;binary&rdquo; opposition of information theory, that leaves no room to consider either 
shades of grey or structural components only implied in a composition, and heavily 
dependent on Eugene Narmour) that carries over into the book here under review.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> In the Introduction to <i>Reading Pop</i>, he criticizes Allen Forte for applying, 
without critical judgment, the &ldquo;formalist&rdquo; tenets of Schenkerian analysis in the 
book, <i>The American Popular Ballad</i>.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Clearly, Middleton is in no position 
to judge the great degree of interpretation that has led Forte to borrow from Schenker 
what is relevant to the song at hand, and to reconfigure the apparatus according 
to the harmonic and voice-leading events that confront the analyst as they differ 
from common-practice conventions. And when contributor Peter Winkler advises the 
reader that the notation in his graphic analysis of melodic structure in one example 
is &ldquo;based on Heinrich Schenker&rsquo;s theories,&rdquo; the editor is at a loss to rectify this 
statement with an example&rsquo;s notation that groups skips and steps within single slurs, 
arbitrarily mixes open stemmed notes with others unstemmed, and does not suggest 
any contrapuntal or harmonic support whatsoever for the vocal part&mdash;ultimately, 
the example says little about harmony or voice leading, and the connection to Schenker 
is phantasmagoric.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Middleton believes Schenker&rsquo;s privileging the falling fifth&mdash;particularly 
that supporting V-I&mdash;as a harmonic motion, as opposed to other pairs of chords that 
may occur more frequently in particular songs, is value-based and arbitrary. Where 
the contrapuntal IV-I embellishment occurs often in a song, he says, &ldquo;the role of 
the plagal effect is to modify the otherwise strong I-V-I tendency which Schenkerians 
could easily find in the <i>Ursatz</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> He seems to 
be suggesting that IV can generate just as much harmonic value in relation to I 
as can V. After all, both pairs of chords, IV-I and V-I, are related by the 
same interval class, right? More fundamentally, Middleton and others in this book 
argue that structural tonal norms are determined within specific pieces rather than 
through essences of tonal behavior, and that all triads have essentially equal intrinsic 
harmonic value. </p>
<p>[6] In this case and many others, editor and writers share a fundamental-bass 
predisposition that fogs over both subtleties and deeper relationships
tying together voice leading, counterpoint, chord, scale 
degree, and harmony. As an example of such confusion, the
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'><span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>VII-IV-I pattern is characterized by Alf Bj&ouml;rnberg 
as &ldquo;fairly low&rdquo; in &ldquo;directionality,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> whereas the sequence should be recognized 
as one with highly goal-directed voice leading and with no harmonic function at 
all beyond the consonant support of neighboring and passing tones. Early in her 
essay on Jimi Hendrix,<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Sheila Whiteley admits problems in articulating just what musical factors permit what she refers to as progressive rock to contradict &ldquo;mainstream pop conventions;&rdquo; a Schenkerian view would have provided a most powerful tool for making such a case. Furthermore, Middleton holds that &ldquo;gestural analysis&rdquo; (a topic well developed in <i>Studying Popular Music</i>) is given short shrift in traditional musicology,<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> even though the true identification of a melodic gesture, on the surface as well as at deeper levels, 
is precisely the sort of thing that Schenkerian analysis clarifies beyond reproach. 
Middleton and others who criticize the application of Schenkerian analysis to popular 
music of the twentieth century often express the belief that the analyst is uncritically 
occupied with trying to force the piece at hand into the Procrustean bed, when to 
my experience, any skillful Schenkerian is most interested in calling attention 
to the tensions that exist between a given tonal diatonic piece and conventions 
of the tonal system. In other words, the Schenkerian&rsquo;s task is to clarify just how 
any one piece of tonal diatonic music <i>distorts</i> normative structures, a condition 
often achieved through an unbalanced overemphasis of embellishments above thrown-away 
structural events, exactly the concept that is celebrated in a non-Schenkerian context 
by David Brackett&rsquo;s discussion of a weakened cadential V in James Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Superbad.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
Rounding out this discussion of Middleton&rsquo;s view of Schenker, it seems pertinent 
to point out that he complains that theorists have no mechanism for understanding 
rhythm,<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> showing a lack of awareness or understanding of the seminal work of 
Carl Schachter and William Rothstein, among many others, over the past twenty-five 
years. And Bj&ouml;rnberg is unfortunately allowed to use the term &ldquo;prolongation&rdquo; to 
refer to a method of phrase expansion.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>
<p>[7] Middleton&rsquo;s musical problems extend far beyond matters related to Schenker. 
One of his criticisms of the traditional-musicological approach to the analysis 
of popular music turns incomprehensible in passing from one sentence to the next: 
&ldquo;There is a tendency to use inappropriate or loaded terminology. Terms like &lsquo;pandiatonic cluster&rsquo; applied to pop songs really do tend to position them alongside Stravinsky, 
even though it is not at all clear that anything comparable is going on there.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> 
But later in the book we discover that the meaning of the term &ldquo;pandiatonic&rdquo; as 
coined by Slonimsky (and as made clear in any reliable music dictionary that might 
be available in an editor&rsquo;s library) is unknown to Middleton, who allows Peter Winkler 
to use it in place of &ldquo;bitonal,&rdquo; citing in this connection the famous tritone-opposed 
major-chord arpeggiations in <i>Petroushka</i>.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Only then do we understand why 
Middleton hears octatonic Stravinsky in Slonimsky&rsquo;s word, one that might conjure 
in the rest of us an added-sixth or eleventh chord or some other <i>diatonic</i>
sonority that is quite at home in pop songs belonging to any number of genres. At 
an even more basic level, the entire notion of diatonicism seems unclear to Middleton. 
He and his writers are on firm footing when they oppose blues-based minor-pentatonic 
material against major-mode conventions, because melodies in the former typically 
follow no stepwise voice-leading norms and, more significantly, often behave with 
no consonance-dissonance relations whatever, although these properties are not offered 
as reasons.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> But modal music is also set in opposition to &ldquo;diatonic&rdquo; music without 
a definition of their difference (e.g., Stan Hawkins: &ldquo;This use of modality, in 
contrast to diatonic harmony <nobr>. . .</nobr> &rdquo;),<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> and often wrongly; apparently unknown 
to this group, modal popular music usually contains the same voice-leading procedures 
characteristic of major-mode music, and whereas Dorian, Mixolydian, and Aeolian 
songs often feature passing and neighboring chordal patterns that differ significantly 
from those common in the major mode, modal harmonic relationships often differ in 
color but not in function from their corresponding major-mode relatives. One wonders 
what precise meaning Middleton finds in this Hawkins statement: &ldquo;As with most modality, 
the harmonic features of &lsquo;Anna Stesia,&rsquo; on first hearing, seem to occupy a transitional 
space between tonality and modality.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> The editor&rsquo;s 
passive confusion regarding the nature of diatony is perhaps most obvious in a comparison 
of two quotations made by Sean Cubitt, in which the writer provides a misreading 
of the word &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; taking it to signify &ldquo;non-modern&rdquo; as opposed to its intended 
&ldquo;achromatic&rdquo; meaning. The misreading leads him to believe that the nature of diatonicism 
changed between 1774 and 1848, a confusion that at the same time undermines his 
(and, by proxy, Middleton&rsquo;s) larger argument that the foundations of single analytical 
systems cannot serve two different objects of analysis that he finds unrelated, 
such as examples of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; and &ldquo;popular&rdquo; musics. Here is Cubitt&rsquo;s argument: 
&ldquo;The rules governing musical expression are conventional, not necessary, and are 
therefore subject to historical change. To illustrate this point: the <i>Oxford 
English Dictionary </i>gives two illuminating early uses of the word &lsquo;diatonic:&rsquo; Burney&rsquo;s 1774 <i>History of Music</i> which states that &lsquo;In modern music the Genera are but two: Diatonic and Chromatic;&rsquo; and Ramboul writing in 1848 (that significant 
date) of &lsquo;Diatonic, the natural scale.&rsquo; Would this suggest that between the Wilkes 
riots and the June revolution, what has been modern had become natural?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> How 
trenchant to be able to weave a bit of political history into the comparison, but 
musically, the inept illustration is not redeemed by irrelevant nimble-wittedness.
</p>
<p>[8] Regarding &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; terminology, the reader in possession of the common 
understanding of the term &ldquo;binary form,&rdquo; with its two sections and predictable tonal 
relationships, is thrown off balance by Stan Hawkins&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;binary form 
is one of the most common structures found in popular music song.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> 
But it eventually becomes clear that for Hawkins, the term relates not to classical-music 
practice but to the either/or opposition of two contrasting sections, verse and 
chorus, even where no tonicization takes place, even where the sections can be repeated 
in any order and any number of times, and even when a contrasting bridge is present, 
a condition that would lead most listeners to count three contrasting formal sections.
</p>
<p>[9] A potentially interesting discussion by Sean Cubitt on the fade-out common 
in pop recordings could have benefited in the writing or editing stage from an 
understanding of the differences between surface and structure. Unfortunately, he 
extrapolates from his misunderstanding in this regard to create a weak foundation 
for a Gotcha! political statement. When he argues that Chuck Berry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maybelline&rdquo; 
lacks a conclusion because the song fades out, he has mistakenly sought the final 
tonic in the very final sound of a cold-ending surface, rather than at the conclusion 
of the deeper structure, where it appears quite boldly. I suppose Cubitt would leave 
a Gary Cooper western, the final shot of which has the hero riding into the invisible 
distance, wondering how things would have worked out had a &ldquo;real&rdquo; ending been supplied. 
The following is how he hears the end of Berry&rsquo;s song, an interpretation that gradually 
grows in its political application as the sound dies away: &ldquo;As it spirals down to 
the silence of the last grooves, it sends us outwards from itself to seek the completion 
of the song elsewhere. The melody does not even offer the fictional resolution of 
the restored tonic. It does not, in Coleridge&rsquo;s famous phrase, &lsquo;contain in itself 
the reason why it is so and not otherwise.&rsquo; The great interest of the popular song 
for me is the way in which it confounds the Aristotelian aesthetics of the object, 
and with it the Cartesian notion of the subject: whole, autonomous, independent, 
closed. It demands instead a materialist aesthetic, where any single utterance is 
meaningful only in the context of the other discourses that surround it and the 
multiplicity of subjects imbricated in its production, both as artists and 
listeners.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> Cubitt surpasses 
his rambling about the distracted interdisciplinary listener, going so far as to 
address the song's erotic involvement &ldquo;with every other subject on the planet,&rdquo; 
all because the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; final tonic went by him unnoticed.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup></p>
<p>[10] Aristotle, Descartes, Coleridge; let&rsquo;s talk Achilles here, and Captain Queeg 
too while we&rsquo;re at it. Because Middleton brings all of 
the criticism given in this review down upon himself, in response to his own skewering 
of others without regard to his own frailties. Remember his complaint about &ldquo;a tendency 
to use inappropriate or loaded terminology&rdquo;? We&rsquo;ve shown a number of such examples 
from this book. But the deepest hubris appears in the context of his outright dismissal 
of the Americans: &ldquo;The tradition to which Forte belongs is not represented in this 
book<nobr>. . .</nobr> [W]ithout a grounding in a critique of its own assumptions, their approach 
is debarred from the self-reflexivity required for a properly theorized account 
of the relationship between analytical method and musical practice.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> All the 
&ldquo;self-reflexivity&rdquo; missing in the American writers cited by Middleton is probably 
the sort of instruction in sausage-making that is favored by Philip Tagg, Stan Hawkins, 
and other contributors to this book who labor intensively over discussing their 
methodologies (particularly in the ubiquitous semiotic department), the gist of 
which is usually really quite apparent without all the self-important wrapping. 
I think most readers of analytical-interpretative essays (metatheoretical tracts 
aside, that is) are more interested in the writer&rsquo;s hearing of the song than a full 
description of&mdash;and justification for&mdash;the method, unless it is in some way not 
apparent in and of itself. American writers have not typically found it necessary 
to provide their core audiences extended coaching in how to read even the novel 
implications of their interpretations, assuming a general level of technical competence 
and an imagination live enough that a simple reference 
to a tonal feature perhaps common only in recent popular repertoires will lead the 
experienced reader to an appreciation of such deviations from the sorts of things 
that would have been encountered in older music. That Middleton praises the &ldquo;rigour&rdquo; 
of Stan Hawkins&rsquo; and Philip Tagg&rsquo;s texts,<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> loaded as 
they are with voluminous and at times irrelevant lists, shows that both writer and 
editor lack perspective on the value of a reader&rsquo;s time.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> But Middleton has far 
deeper problems with Forte, whereas he could have profited from the American&rsquo;s example. 
Allen Forte&rsquo;s consummate musical skill, a rapier-sharp 
pen (which has perhaps hit its mark unnoticed even in the one quoted passage reproduced 
below), and above all, a graciousness of spirit that relaxes in a truly fulfilling 
self-reflexivity are three attributes not shared by his critic. Concluding his dismissal 
of Forte&rsquo;s <i>The American Popular Ballad</i>, Middleton writes: &ldquo;The larger issues 
of method, as discussed above, are not broached until the final two pages of the 
book, and then Forte&rsquo;s response is a cheerfully confessed ignorance: &lsquo;At the present 
time there appears to be a distinct split between scholars who are interested in 
a music-analytic approach to the study of popular music and those who regard popular 
music as a sociological artifact<nobr>. . .</nobr> The issues are broad, cloudy and potentially 
significant <nobr>. . .</nobr> musicology cannot afford to neglect studies of popular music as 
music, for otherwise the sociological view <nobr>. . .</nobr> will prevail [&mdash;even though] . 
. . to show how incompetent I am to judge writings in this area, I readily acknowledge 
my inability to grasp <nobr>. . .</nobr> [examples of the &ldquo;sociological view&rdquo;]&rsquo;.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> Middleton 
pounces mercilessly on Forte&rsquo;s polite and &ldquo;unguarded&rdquo; declaration, unaware that 
he displays incompetencies just as severe at the opposite end of the sociology-music 
pairing. And I don&rsquo;t detect a trace of irony in the attack. </p>
<p>[11] Two last examples in the &ldquo;take that, Richard&rdquo; department: Some information 
seems to have fallen between cracks opened up by the author-date
citation system: a reference to Marcus 1977<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> leads 
to no bibliographical listing (this error appeared to me through a curiosity exercised 
only sporadically&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t say whether there are other such mishaps). One final 
curiosity: If Tin Pan Alley were truly on &ldquo;28th Avenue.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup> 
it must have been based in Secaucus! </p>
<p><b><nobr>. . .</nobr> And the good news <nobr>. . .</nobr></b></p>
<p>[12] Actually, despite the large issues discussed above, and
other smaller issues, too many to mention here, and despite 
the pugnacious stance taken time and again against many potential admirers and beneficiaries, 
Middleton has put together a fascinating volume. There is some excellent music pulled 
apart here, often with expert readings, and we are given great insights into text 
and methodology that will benefit any reader interested in popular music ranging 
from the torch singers of the 1920s through a few music videos of the early 1990s. 
And my highest praise goes to the editor for the frequent exercise of fair use in 
quoting words and music, often extending through the unauthorized quotations of 
entire lyrics. Far too few authors, editors, and publishers are willing to defend 
their scholarly rights in as strong a stand as is taken in this project, and so
<i>Reading Pop</i> should be regarded and referred to as an important precedent 
for all future work in the area. </p>
<p>[13] The book&rsquo;s lead essay is one of the best. Winkler is a good enough writer 
to draw the reader in, he raises imaginative issues, he is a perceptive reader of 
Randy Newman&rsquo;s evocative lyrics, and his transcriptions are first-rate (but then 
we have come to expect that of him, particularly following his chapter in <i>Keeping 
Score</i>).<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> Dai Griffiths provides the book&rsquo;s best poetry in his clever and 
witty reading of Bruce Springsteen, and his original interest in syllabification 
unmatched elsewhere is substantiated with intelligent musical observations.<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup> 
Charles Hamm discusses some specific features in the music of Irving Berlin, especially 
useful when relating performance-practice issues to meaning in a brief analysis 
that addresses the taxonomy of genres.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup> Ellie Hisama&rsquo;s thinking is extremely 
perceptive and original, and is simultaneously sensitive and provocative in her 
criticism of the racist attitudes and gender stereotypes underlying three disparate 
examples of recent music.<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> Timothy Taylor gives us another great reading of lyrics 
and an extended, thoughtful argument as to how the rock backbeat is an antiestablishment 
statement.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> I have long felt the same way about the lowered seventh scale degree, 
in that the rejection of the subservient leading tone can often be taken as a rebellion 
against the dominant culture. </p>
<p>[14] Music theorists who are interested in reading cultural studies of popular 
songs and singers, particularly if a politically attuned preference for semiotic 
labelling is considered <i>de rigueur</i>, will probably find this volume consistently 
interesting. Those who wish to see a variety of approaches 
to the interpretation of song lyrics will also find many essays illuminating and 
useful.<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> Those, however, who might be looking for fresh 
insights into the often unusual and sometimes challenging musical text of popular 
songs, will probably do best to seek out the articles referred to in paragraph
[13] as originally published in <i>Popular Music</i>. 
Browsing there, who knows; one might come across something better than some of the 
pieces collected here. And that person who economizes 
in such a way ($70 cloth, $19.95 paper) will be doubly enriched by having been spared 
Richard Middleton&rsquo;s gratuitously offensive Introduction.</p>

75.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">Tagg&rsquo;s call, familiar from previous work, underlies his argument in &ldquo;Analysing 
Popular Music,&rdquo; 77.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Fiori, &ldquo;Listening to Peter Gabriel&rsquo;s &lsquo;I Have the Touch&rsquo;,&rdquo; 183&ndash;91.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Moore, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Hieroglyphics of Love&rsquo;: The Torch Singers and Interpretation,&rdquo; 
262&ndash;96.</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">Leppert and Lipsitz, &ldquo;&lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s Lonesome for Somebody&rsquo;: Age, the Body, 
and Experience in the Music of Hank Williams,&rdquo; 307&ndash;28.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton presents his understanding of Schenkerian analysis in <i>Studying 
Popular Music</i> (Buckingham, UK: Open University Press, 1990), 192&ndash;97.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Allen Forte, <i>The American Popular Ballad of the Golden Era 1924&ndash;1950</i> 
(Princeton University Press, 1995).</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">The example is 1.6, on p. 38. Winkler characterizes it in &ldquo;Randy Newman&rsquo;s 
Americana,&rdquo; 41, n. 3.</div><div id="fndiv13" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Popular Music Analysis,&rdquo; 115. The editor footnotes this observation 
(115, n. 5) thus: &ldquo;For Schenker&rsquo;s theory, which sees all good music as based on 
an underlying I-V-I harmonic progression, see [<i>Studying Popular Music</i>], 192&ndash;5.&rdquo;</div><div id="fndiv14" class="flyoverdiv">The &#x266d;VII - IV - I pattern, quite common in rock 
music, is exemplified in Sheila Whiteley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Progressive Rock and Psychedelic Coding 
in the Work of Jimi Hendrix,&rdquo; 239, as well as in Bj&ouml;rnberg, &ldquo;Structural Relationships,&rdquo; 
360.</div><div id="fndiv15" class="flyoverdiv">Whiteley, &ldquo;Progressive Rock,&rdquo; 236.</div><div id="fndiv16" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Popular Music Analysis,&rdquo; 120.</div><div id="fndiv17" class="flyoverdiv">Brackett, &ldquo;James Brown&rsquo;s &lsquo;Superbad&rsquo; and the Double-Voiced Utterance,&rdquo; 135.</div><div id="fndiv18" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; 4.</div><div id="fndiv19" class="flyoverdiv">Bj&ouml;rnberg, &ldquo;Structural Relationships,&rdquo; 356.</div><div id="fndiv20" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; 4.</div><div id="fndiv21" class="flyoverdiv">Winkler, &ldquo;Randy Newman&rsquo;s Americana,&rdquo; 51.</div><div id="fndiv22" class="flyoverdiv">Actually, Winkler tries to link a pentatonic melody to supportive harmony, but this remains unconvincing because such scale degrees are fundamentally unlinked to all harmonic function. Black-key melodic dissonance resolution in an E&#x266d; blues on the piano, for example, is far more limited an effect than that in a diatonic system.</div><div id="fndiv23" class="flyoverdiv">Hawkins, &ldquo;Prince: Harmonic Analysis of &lsquo;Anna Stesia&rsquo;,&rdquo; 63.</div><div id="fndiv24" class="flyoverdiv">Hawkins, &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; 63.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">Cubitt, &ldquo;&lsquo;Maybelline&rsquo;: Meaning and the Listening Subject,&rdquo; 150.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">Hawkins, &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; 60, n. 1.</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv">Cubitt, &ldquo;&lsquo;Maybelline&rsquo;,&rdquo; 157.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">Cubitt, &ldquo;&lsquo;Maybelline&rsquo;,&rdquo; 158.</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; 6&ndash;7.</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Analysing the Music,&rdquo; 23.</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">Hawkins misses the forest for the trees in another essential way, too; whereas 
the chordal (&ldquo;harmonic&rdquo;) language in the single song by Prince, &ldquo;Anna Stesia&rdquo; (despite 
its amazing dearth of harmonic interest), is his sole area of inquiry, he never 
does point out the relationship between the title&rsquo;s pun and the static, sleep-inducing 
nature of a song entirely devoid of a major-mode dominant.</div><div id="fndiv32" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; 6; ellipses and brackets are Middleton&rsquo;s. Forte 
is quoted from <i>The American Popular Ballad</i>, 334, 335, 347.</div><div id="fndiv33" class="flyoverdiv">Middleton, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; 2, n. 2.</div><div id="fndiv34" class="flyoverdiv">Moore, &ldquo;&lsquo;The Hieroglyphics&rsquo;,&rdquo; 263.</div><div id="fndiv35" class="flyoverdiv">Winkler, &ldquo;Writing Ghost Notes: The Poetics and Politics of Transcription,&rdquo;

297&ndash;306.</div><div id="fndiv38" class="flyoverdiv">Hisama, &ldquo;Postcolonialism on the Make: The Music of John Mellencamp, David 
Bowie, and John Zorn,&rdquo; 329&ndash;46.</div><div id="fndiv39" class="flyoverdiv">Taylor, &ldquo;His Name Was in Lights: Chuck Berry&rsquo;s &lsquo;Johnny B. Goode&rsquo;,&rdquo; 165&ndash;82.</div><div id="fndiv40" class="flyoverdiv">The lone chapter not mentioned elsewhere in this review presents&mdash;despite 
its display of admirable depth and occasional flair&mdash;what is to me a largely off-the-mark 
reading of a set of Buddy Holly&rsquo;s lyrics and his vocal articulation of them: Barbara 
Bradby and Brian Torode, &ldquo;Pity Peggy Sue,&rdquo; 203&ndash;27.</div>
