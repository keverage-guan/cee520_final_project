<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>[1.1] The renderings of musical analysis which follow are based on analytical
approaches which have been influenced by Heinrich Schenker. This application forms a part
of a larger project to explore the study of Schenkerian analysis in multimedia computer
environments.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Multimedia technology invites music
theorists to consider new ways of modeling musical processes, creating new opportunities
to enhance understanding of music through visualization. On-screen texts and other
computerized media differ from traditional media in significant ways, are organized
differently, and function in different ways to accomplish different purposes.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> The transfer of theoretical graphs to an electronic
environment necessitates decisions which inevitably have substantive consequences for the
music theorist and teacher. The use of multimedia invites the extension of our analytical
metaphors in new directions. As we further the development of a rich real-time computer
environment for musical analysis, new issues relevant to the study of music theory and
cognition will emerge. It is hoped that these electronic musical analyses will serve as
models for more ambitious multimedia-enhanced studies while promoting critical discussion.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p>[1.2] A rich computer environment should offer new possibilities unavailable using
traditional media. These multimedia renderings are intended as models which extend the
technology currently employed in expressing Schenkerian analysis. Their purpose is to
explore how the use of electronic media might shape and expand expressions of meaning in
an analytical graph. Limited in scope, the examples are not in any way intended to
represent a complete pedagogy or a substitute for the study of orthodox Schenkerian
models. Building upon the premise that a Schenkerian graph is an illuminating metaphor for
representing musical processes, the aim in creating these multimedia analyses is to extend
the communicative power of the graph, exploring new ways to model essential features such
as linear shape, direction, and structural levels.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></p>

<h3>2. Artistic Participation: Imaging the Masterwork</h3>

<p>[2.1] Aristotle provides the classical definition of metaphor: &ldquo;Metaphor (<em>metaphora</em>)
is the transference (<em>epiphora</em>) of a name to some other object.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> A similarity of some kind between the commonplace
meaning of a term and its metaphorical meaning justifies their association. As Aristotle
writes, &ldquo;A good metaphor implies an intuitive perception of the similarity of
dissimilars.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Paul Henle has pointed out that
this resemblance has a dual nature, &ldquo;an antecedent resemblance, which justifies the
comparison in the first place, and an induced resemblance, which arises from the very fact
that the comparison was made.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> A metaphor may
stabilize over time, becoming a commonplace unit of language. But if the aspect of induced
resemblance in a complex metaphor is contemplated and enriched, it may retain its
irreducible, evocative power.</p>

<p>[2.2] Schenker created evocative visual and textual metaphors of lasting communicative
power to express his analytical methodology. Antecedent resemblances in the visual domain,
derived primarily from symbols of musical notation, are combined with word antecedents
which metaphorically relate musical space to terms of spatial orientation in the physical
world. The process of induced resemblance is continually revised and renewed as readers
study Schenker&rsquo;s contribution and the vast amount of more recent work which incorporates
Schenkerian methodology.</p>

<p>[2.3] A Schenkerian graph visually communicates an analysis to a reader versed in its
embodied concepts and symbology&mdash;its &ldquo;root metaphors.&rdquo; Meaning occurs as
correlations between the reader&rsquo;s conception of the music and the symbolic elements of the
graph resonate with expression of metaphor. &ldquo;Reading&rdquo; a graph requires an act of
imagination and poetic faith similar to that which any metaphorical text tacitly assumes.
It is worth noting, however, that for Schenker, the graph is more than an interpretation
of music expressed in a visual image. Schenker&rsquo;s stance toward his graphic analyses is
essentially metaphorical. For Schenker, the graph <em>is</em> the piece&mdash;a direct
manifestation of the musical artifact. Schenker&rsquo;s observations are founded on principles
he regarded as universals, which were &ldquo;true in the sense of the truth of the great
masters.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> The point here is not to delve deeply
in to Schenker&rsquo;s rhetoric or epistemology&mdash;a vastly complex topic&mdash;but simply to
underscore the central role of metaphor.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> If the
analytical graph is appreciated more fully as a metaphor or metonym, then one can more
readily accept the notion that the graphic rendering <em>is</em> the music made tangible.
To offer an analogy, it is not so different from the proud parent who pulls out a
photograph and says, &ldquo;These are my children.&rdquo; The photograph, of course, does
not constitute children and yet onlookers immediately accept the &ldquo;similarities in
dissimilarities&rdquo; embodied in the photograph. The photograph captures an essence
representative of the whole.</p>

<p>[2.4] Aristotle writes, &ldquo;Art either imitates nature or else gives the finishing
touches to what nature has left incomplete.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> A
useful example of both imitation and participation in rendering &ldquo;what nature has left
incomplete&rdquo; can be found in the Paleolithic cave paintings of deer found in France
and Spain. It has been observed that animals in cave paintings are sometimes drawn where
there are already depressions or fissures in the rock which might serve as a deer&rsquo;s head
or antlers. This suggests that the Aurignacian artist may have felt the presence of the
totemic animal already manifest in the rock itself and experienced a sense of
participation in helping to bring forth the energy represented in the powerful image.</p>

<p>[2.5] This element of participation in making manifest for all to see that which is
already present in nature (i.e., nature as represented in the &ldquo;universal truths&rdquo;
embodied in the masterworks) perfectly characterizes Schenker&rsquo;s stance toward the musical
work. In the his introduction to <em>Free Composition</em>, Schenker writes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The musical examples which accompany this volume are not merely practical aids; they
  have the same power and conviction as the visual aspect of the printed composition itself
  (the foreground). That is, the graphic representation is part of the actual composition,
  not merely an educational means.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[2.6] The qualities of imitation and participation which are embodied in the
communication of metaphor are central to Schenker&rsquo;s approach. The great masters provided
the foreground, as represented through the visual artifact of the score.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> It was Schenker&rsquo;s expressed task to complete the visual presence
of the art work, thereby illuminating, as Aristotle describes, &ldquo;what nature has left
incomplete.&rdquo; As Schenker states, &ldquo;Since the task of revealing the world of the
background fell to me, I was not spared the difficulty of finding symbols for it.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup></p>

<h3>3. Altering the Knowledge Medium</h3>

<p>[3.1] Schenker sometimes used the word &ldquo;pictures&rdquo; (<em>Bilder</em>) to refer
to analytical graphs. Though sometimes translated as &ldquo;illustrations,&rdquo; the notion
of Schenker as a maker of pictures which render the art work visible is intriguing.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Traditionally, words have been the privileged medium
for directly conveying important ideas, with &ldquo;illustrations,&rdquo; like forms of
imagery evoked through pictorial language, serving a function somehow external and
subservient. This reflects a traditional hierarchy which can be traced to the Latin poet,
Horace, who advised mixing &ldquo;the sweet with the useful,&rdquo; employing the ornamental
image to guide the reader toward the &ldquo;valuable lesson.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> Although theorists since ancient times have employed visual
imagery to convey ideas, Schenker more than any other theorist has altered this paradigm.
Schenker&rsquo;s decision to speak through visual images necessarily precluded even the
possibility of <em>saying</em> all there might be to say in his accompanying texts,
because the visual image has virtually limitless connotations. That Schenker&rsquo;s graphs
speak volumes on their own is partly due to the nature of visual objects. Visual
information may be semantically rich, spatial, and temporal, differing greatly from
symbolic information represented in alphanumeric form. Data base designers are now at work
creating image searching systems to meet the challenges posed by new data types of images
and videos.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> As multimedia archives for music
proliferate, the modes by which musical scholars present their work and access knowledge
will necessarily evolve.</p>

<p>[3.2] Schenker himself was no advocate of new technology.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> 
It is somewhat ironic that Schenker decried the proliferation of technology as symptomatic
of a cultural decline while pushing the envelope on media technology in terms of how a
scholarly book should look and function. Employing visual media to communicate complex
ideas, he prefigured the cultural shift toward multiple modalities we experience today.
The multimedia examples which follow are intended to provide a glimpse of the ways
computer representation might aid in the understanding of spatial metaphors which are
inherent in a Schenkerian approach. As a preliminary study, each example might be regarded
as a &ldquo;miniature&rdquo; which in some way offers an added dimension to the traditional
graphic model. The first example embeds explanations and interpretations within a graph
through overlays accessed through user response. The second and third examples employ
color, sound, motion, and perspective to enhance representation of hierarchical layers.
Example 4 renders a digitally scanned score excerpt synchronized with an artist ensemble
sound clip and an analytical graphic overlay, illustrating a format for on-line study of
an authentic document and audio recording. The last example is an analysis of a short
piece in its entirety, with graphic analysis, real-time score display and commentary.</p>

<h3>4. Multimedia Rendering: Haydn, Divertimento in B flat, II (<em>Chorale St. Antoni</em>)</h3>

<p>[4.1] Through the use of interactive computer graphics, interpretations of a sketch can
be embedded within it. The Shockwave-enabled graph employs imbedded &ldquo;balloon&rdquo;
annotations to provide a tutorial on some basic Schenkerian symbols. It is based on a
sketch by Forte and Gilbert. In this excerpt from the <em>Chorale St. Antoni</em>
attributed to Haydn (see <b>Example 1</b>), the neighbor note figure at m. 6 is expanded in the next measure,
returning again as an incomplete neighbor three measures later. As shown in the graph,
both D and C are elaborated with passing tones which receive consonant support.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.2] Graphic overlays in the example provide more information. Schenker interpreted
this five-bar phrase as a grouping of 3+2, with a tonic prolongation at measures 1&ndash;3
followed by a two-measure cadence. The dotted rhythm helps articulate the paired linear
motions each descending by third. Discussing the opening 5-measure phrase, Wallace Berry
suggests at least the possibility of a contrary interpretation of 2+3 measures, given the
change in texture, chromaticism, and harmony at measure 3. His conception of
&ldquo;interphrase grouping&rdquo; in the opening could apply as well to the consequent
phrase shown in the example.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.3] Schenker&rsquo;s voice leading graph in <em>Free Composition</em> (Figure 42, 2)
provides a broader context for understanding the passage. Schenker&rsquo;s graph reveals a
deeper level of the middleground for the entire theme, showing the dividing dominant which
precedes the consequent phrase quoted in Forte and Gilbert&rsquo;s example. Note that the
deep-level elaboration of scale degree 3 with an upper neighbor note in Schenker&rsquo;s graph
(marked &ldquo;n.n.&rdquo;) nicely corresponds to the foreground-level neighbor motions
shown in Forte and Gilbert&rsquo;s graph at m. 6&ndash;7. (A scan of Schenker&rsquo;s complete voice leading
graph is provided in the multimedia version with the kind permission of European American
Music.)</p>

<h3>5. Multimedia Rendering: Bach, French Suite No. 2, Menuet</h3>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="koozin_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="koozin_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[5.1] <b>Example 2</b>, based on a study by David Beach in <em>Aspects of Schenkerian
Theory</em>, employs color and sound to enhance the presentation of the graph.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> Surface-level events are shown in black. The running
eighth notes of the foreground embellish a deeper stepwise motive shown in red. Brackets
in this rhythmic reduction show how the third-span in bar 1 is extended in bar 2 and again
in bars 3&ndash;4. Notice that the longer line spanning the sixth E down to G fills in the
interval found in the first two eighth notes of the melody.</p>

<p>[5.2] The deeper graph in blue shows how voice exchange occurs on both tonic and
dominant harmony. This excerpt also illustrates the concept of interruption. The
structural line descending from 3 (shown with stemmed notes highlighted in yellow) is
interrupted after the motion to 2. Using the buttons alongside the example, it is possible
to hear a &ldquo;realization&rdquo; of each level of the graph. This is a useful tool for
helping students hear relationships among structural levels. Two realizations are offered
for the middle reduction in red. Realization 2 interprets the tied F in the bass more
literally, underscoring the connection for a complete octave ascent in the bass while
underplaying the tonic harmony at measure 3.</p>

<p>[5.3] The contrasting realizations illustrate how an aural complement may enhance a
graph and even provoke new ways of hearing a passage. While it is important to clarify
that an audio rendering can only &ldquo;simulate&rdquo; a deeper structure, it may
nonetheless provide a powerful aural metaphor.</p>

<h3>6. An Animated Rendering: A Question of Perspective</h3>

<p>[6.1] A graphic analysis can vividly represent hierarchical processes in music. While a
musical graph customarily takes the form of a static image on a flat page, it may richly
evoke spatial qualities of proportion and perspective. The animated rendering shown here
underscores the element of perspective implied in any hierarchical analysis. Though
perhaps a bit whimsical, it challenges our assumption that a musical graph is necessarily
a static image on a flat page.</p>

<p>[6.2] Analysts have often displayed structural layers in a top-down reductive model.
From a pragmatic point of view, it makes sense to put the musical foreground first,
showing underlying layers of structure beneath it which are revealed through the process
of reduction. David Beach&rsquo;s well-known analysis of this passage is rendered in this
manner.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[6.3] We should hasten to clarify that this particular example represents three
hierarchical layers&mdash;or more specifically, a passage in a composition, a metric reduction,
and a middleground graph&mdash;and not a Schenkerian foreground, middleground and background.
It does, nonetheless, serve to dramatize the element of spatial orientation we generally
take for granted in layer analysis. Schenker&rsquo;s own graphs are generally rendered in a
bottom-up model of compositional unfolding or &ldquo;composing out&rdquo; (<em>Auskomponierung</em>).
This places the graphic reduction in the more privileged position, showing how the piece
unfolds through elaboration and&nbsp;diminution of the fundamental structure.</p>

<p>[6.4] The question of &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; or &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; is, in part, an
ideological issue. The point to be made here is that it is also a question of perspective,
deriving ultimately from the metaphorical representation of music through spatial imagery.</p>




<p>[6.5] As Peter Westergaard rhymed in his &ldquo;Geometries of Sound in Time&rdquo;: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To show the pulls and tugs, to show tension<br>
  we need&mdash;as Schenker found&mdash;a third dimension.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                
<p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="koozin_examples.php?id=2&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 3 thumbnail" src="koozin_ex3_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>
<p>Another simulation offered here (see <b>Example 3</b>) is inspired by Westergaard&rsquo;s rendering, in which he
skews Schenker&rsquo;s layers &ldquo;as they might have been redrawn by F.-E. von Cube.&rdquo;
Tracing a line through the <em>Schichten</em> from foreground to a single vanishing point,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>each now&rsquo;s a line, and all nows complete<br>
  their journeys at a triad where they meet.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>[6.6] In the future, computer environments may enable us to represent the spatial
qualities of music in new ways. Rendering software for animated three-dimensional imaging
is now available, but music theorists have yet to take full advantage of it to model
musical structures. Perhaps one day we will visualize music through vivid
three-dimensional renderings, virtually moving through layered environments as we explore
musical processes.</p>

<h3>7. Multimedia Rendering: Arcangelo Corelli, Trio Sonata, Op. 3, No. 2, Fourth Movement</h3>

<p>[7.1] <b>Example 4</b> demonstrates on-line delivery of synchronous high-resolution
digitized images and audio. (Sound recording is used by permission of the Smithsonian

<p>[7.2] It is possible to help students begin to recognize linear structures without
necessarily invoking Schenkerian terminology. The graphic overlay shows the linear/motivic
framework projected through a recurring melodic pattern which ascends by step (as shown in
blue) and returns downward (as shown in red). A fauxbourdon-like intervallic pattern based
on the opening motive occurs at m. 8&ndash;10. An augmentation of the ascending gesture is used
to form the closing phrase of the first section, m. 15&ndash;19. </p>

<p>[7.3] A format employing score, audio, and graphic overlay can inform analyses while
minimally intruding on the musical sources under study. It can be particularly useful in
helping students understand how abstract theoretical concepts relate to their experience
of a musical work. </p>

<h3>8. Multimedia Rendering: Schumann, Humming Song (<em>Tr&auml;llerliedchen</em>)</h3>

<p>[8.1] This analysis of a complete piece integrates analytical graphs, a MIDI audio
performance, and a complete &ldquo;scrolling&rdquo; score. The ternary piece consists of
three harmonically closed sections. The subtle differences distinguishing each section are
significant. No perfect authentic cadence is heard until the end of the &ldquo;B&rdquo;
section, underscoring the large-scale motion to the dominant (see <b>Example 5</b>).</p>

<p>[8.2] The motivic repetition highlighted in red marks the climax of the middle section
and the return of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; section. The highpoint in the middle section recalls
the opening notes of the piece, forming a local subdominant elaboration of the dominant.
The climax near the end of the piece, highlighted in blue, is decidedly more dissonant by
comparison, due to the clashing dominant pedal tone.</p>

<p>[8.3] At first glance, it might seem that the opening melody forms an unfolding of the
tonic elaborated through passing tones, as shown in the Alternative View. But this
interpretation (a), would suggest a misreading of the intervallic pattern in tenths in the
outer voices (b). The opening gesture is better viewed as a nested neighbor motion (c).
The linear intervallic pattern in tenths persists throughout, providing a powerful element
of continuity in the piece. With remarkable economy, the bass voice goes its own way only
to direct motion toward cadences.</p>

<h3>9. Conclusion</h3>

<p>[9.1] Friedrich Nietzsche wrote that the formation of metaphors is a fundamental human
impulse: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What therefore is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorphisms: in
  short a sum of human relations which became poetically and rhetorically intensified.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nietzsche asserts that language is fundamentally metaphorical. In the cognitive
hierarchy, visual metaphors are not mere illustrations of verbal expressions, but are more
deeply fundamental. It is not surprising, then, that a Schenkerian graph speaks louder
that words. As Nicholas Cook writes, &ldquo;A Schenkerian analysis is not a scientific
explanation, but a metaphorical one; it is not an account of how people actually hear
pieces of music, but a way of imagining them.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></p>

<p>[9.2] In discussing Cook&rsquo;s contributions, Lawrence M. Zbikowski writes in a recent <em>Music
Theory Online</em> article that &ldquo;A musical culture is, in essence, a repertoire of
means for imagining music.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> This repertoire of
cultural metaphors is in constant flux, as the images pervading a culture evolve. The
metaphors through which we imagine music are unavoidably shaped by modern technology.
Computer-generated visual images and digitized sounds are as much at home in the academy
as they are in the mass media, providing super-realistic documentation to lend authority
to scholarly discourse. As digital media becomes more ubiquitous, it becomes increasingly
important that we as music theorists study how the technological devices we use shape our
analytical and pedagogical work.</p>

<p>[9.3] To study how current technologies may beneficially impact the content and
reception of theoretical discourse, we should explore ways to expand the metaphors through
which we explain music. Pedagogically, multimedia designs are attractive because they
enable us to present complex aural/visual ideas vividly. Concepts that might be cumbersome
to explain verbally are often elucidated quickly through examples that can be seen and
heard. It should not be tacitly assumed, however, that such applications of technology are
&ldquo;transparent&rdquo; or that digital enhancements are automatically a good thing. For
example, the digital appropriation of a musical &ldquo;sound clip,&rdquo; score image, or
other musical artifact is in some ways a subversive act which warrants thoughtful
consideration. There is always danger of trivializing the very thing we wish to explore in
all its depth. On-line academic forums are likely to become increasingly important in this
regard, since they challenge scholars to use new media effectively to communicate
substantive ideas. As serious musical analyses in digital formats become more pervasive in
the scholarly community, they will provide models which can beneficially impact the
quality of Internet-based instruction in the music curriculum.</p>

<p>[9.4] The ability to hypertextually link sounds, graphic analyses, and commentaries may
provide powerful pedagogical tools and lead to open analyses which interrelate multiple
analytical perspectives. But a word of caution is appropriate here as well. A fine
Schenkerian analysis, like a fine piece of music, is rich in its layers of meaning.
Embedded messages in an &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; rendering might elucidate meaning but
could also detract from the communication of subtleties in a musical graph. In Schenkerian
studies, there is also the danger of placing too much emphasis on the graph itself and its
syntactical components, while neglecting the theoretical concepts on which it is based.
Multimedia renderings may help students understand Schenkerian ideas and provide theorists
with new formats for modeling music, but renderings in new media will not serve as a
substitute for primary readings in Schenkerian literature.</p>

<p>[9.5] The examples provided in this study, while limited in scope, have been designed
to go beyond the demonstration of multimedia as an useful presentation tool for teaching.
The intention has been to scratch the surface of what may come in the future as theorists
express Schenkerian concepts using the tools of multimedia. Through the incorporation of
sound, hypertextually linked images and texts, and real-time simulation, current
multimedia technology enables us to expand the ways we model our imaginings of musical
works. This may lead to new conceptions about musical structure and the process through
which we visualize and communicate musical ideas.</p>

The term also appears in later writings. For example, in <i>Der Freie Satz</i> Schenker writes, &ldquo;Die von mir Urlinie-Tafeln benannten Bilder zeigen die vorletzte Stimmf&uuml;hrungsschicht, auf sie folgt der Vordergrund.&rdquo; <i>Neue musickalische Theorien und Phantasien</i>, Vol. III, <i>Der Freie Satz</i>, second ed., edited and revised by Oswald Jonas (Universal Edition, 1956), 58.
