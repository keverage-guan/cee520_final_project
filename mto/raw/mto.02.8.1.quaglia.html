<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The works of Schoenberg&rsquo;s atonal period were written 
for a small, select audience. They have not gained popular acceptance in the 
time since their writing, but they have secured their place in the repertoire of 
modern masterpieces. Without these works, many of the 20th century&rsquo;s subsequent 
masterpieces would perhaps be unthinkable. Despite their status, Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
atonal works are still rarely performed today. Although the audience for these 
works has grown only slightly, the body of analytical and historical works about 
Schoenberg and about the works of this period grows significantly with each 
year. Bryan Simms&rsquo; <i>The Atonal Music of Arnold Schoenberg 1908&ndash;1923</i> makes 
an important contribution to that body of literature.</p>
<p>[2] <i>The Atonal Music of Arnold Schoenberg </i>is tightly organized. The 
author proceeds in the early chapters from a discussion of the biographical and 
historical context within which Schoenberg&rsquo;s compositional impulses developed 
and then goes on in the subsequent chapters to treat the individual works of the 
atonal period in detail. The transition from the language of the late tonal 
works to the language of the early motivic atonal works is described early on, 
and the closing chapters begin to develop the underpinnings of the 12-tone 
method as they may be detected in the techniques of the late atonal works. In 
between, the works are grouped according to various significant features such as 
the use of new vocal techniques, the setting of texts by a particular poet, the 
large dramatic stage works, and the idiosyncratic and brief instrumental works. 
Still, Simms works through these pieces in a more or less chronological fashion 
that focuses on the development of Schoenberg&rsquo;s compositional techniques and 
formal stylistic elements. He correctly notes that the atonal works represent 
neither a specific style nor a particular technique but rather a variety of 
evolving techniques and styles that were initially intuitive for Schoenberg but 
became increasingly systematic as he continued. </p>
<p>[3] Simms&rsquo; book is thoroughly researched and meticulous in 
its detail. It covers not only all of the works of Schoenberg&rsquo;s atonal <i>oeuvre</i>, 
but also treats the large body of analytical and historical thought that has 
surrounded it. Significantly, Simms also considers Schoenberg&rsquo;s own extensive 
writings on music and music theory in his interpretation of the atonal period. 
However, although Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings on music are as voluminous as that of 
any composer since Wagner, they are also often murky, self-contradictory and 
difficult to apply directly to the composer&rsquo;s own music and particularly to his 
atonal works. Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings have been extremely influential on musical 
thinking in our own century; his analytical insights have shaped modern musical 
theory nearly as much as his compositions have influenced the direction that 
composers after him would take. These writings form a necessary contextual 
backdrop for understanding Schoenberg&rsquo;s music, but, as Simms points out &ldquo;they 
are themselves often in need of interpretation&rdquo; (page 4).</p>
<p>[4] I applaud Simms&rsquo; efforts to relate Schoenberg&rsquo;s own 
writings to his music, and I realize the difficulties that attend that task.&nbsp;I 
was, however, slightly disappointed that the discussion of Schoenberg&rsquo;s thought 
on the categories of <i>basic shape (Grundgestalt), 
musical idea,</i> and <i>presentation</i> was not developed more broadly. 
If taken in their broadest sense, <i>Grundgestalt</i> and <i>Gedanke</i> are 
among the most powerful and compelling concepts that Schoenberg evokes in his 
writings, and I believe that they are indispensable to an understanding of 
Schoenberg as a composer and as a musical thinker. The importance of these 
concepts lies especially in the fact that they are not tied to individual 
periods or styles. They transcend the specific compositional techniques that the 
composer used at different times and connect his music inextricably to the music 
of the masters before him. These categories lie at the core of how Schoenberg 
viewed his own evolving musical language and its relationship to the past and 
are critical to a discussion of any period of Schoenberg&rsquo;s compositional output.
</p>
<p>[5] Simms does not ignore these topics by any means; his 
discussion traces the important historical dissemination of these ideas as they 
are handed down in the writings of Schoenberg&rsquo;s students such as Erwin Stein and 
Josef Rufer. Schoenberg is never especially revealing in his own writings about 
these terms, and it is therefore often necessary to rely upon the accounts of 
students such as Rufer and Stein who were apparently privy to discussions of 
these concepts. But the treatment of these ideas is restricted to a relatively 
narrow interpretation. No connection is made to the broader implication of these 
ideas, instead Simms focuses on the relationship between basic shape and 
specific compositional techniques such as row manipulation. That the <i>
Grundgestalt </i>is never really defined by Schoenberg in a precise way in any 
of his writings is a serious setback. However, there is an increasing body of 
recent analytical work that concerns itself with applying the idea of basic 
shape to a broad range of compositional issues, and I would have wished to have 
seen that work represented somewhere, in addition to historical writings. In 
particular, the scholarship of Patricia Carpenter (a Schoenberg student) and 
Severine Neff bears heavily on this topic. The presentation, and therefore 
subsequent development and deployment of the musical idea, is crucial to 
understanding Schoenberg and to understanding the significance of the basic 
shape as a musical concept.</p>
<p>[6] Simms&rsquo; discussion of <i>basic shape</i> is often tied 
to the kinds of relationships Adorno articulates in his article &ldquo;Sch&ouml;nberg: F&uuml;nf 
Orchesterst&uuml;cke, Op. 16,&rdquo; (<i>Pult und Taktstock</i> 4 [1927]: 36&ndash;43): the means 
by which intervallic cells or motives are deployed in both the linear and 
harmonic dimensions at the same time and which therefore create powerful 
corollaries with the serial techniques that would evolve in Schoenberg&rsquo;s later 
music. This is a careful, but perhaps narrow mode of viewing the basic shape and 
ends up seeming synonymous with certain aspects of early twelve-tone technique. It 
may be that the <i>Grundgestalt </i>represents something broader than that to 
Schoenberg, namely a principle of organic 
coherence that manifests itself in particular techniques such as developing 
variation and row partitioning, but which is more elusive than just those 
particular techniques. In <i>The Musical Idea and the Logic, Technique and Art 
of its Presentation</i>, which has been available in translation by Patricia 
Carpenter and Severine Neff for some years now<i> </i>
(New York: Columbia University Press, 1995), I think that Schoenberg 
hints at a much richer and far-reaching conception into which the <i>
Grundgestalt </i>may figure prominently. Although Schoenberg&rsquo;s development of 
the idea of <i>basic set </i>certainly descended from the broader category of <i>
Grundgestalt</i>, I don&rsquo;t believe it ever became limited to just that. </p>
<p>[7] Simms covers the gamut of historical perspectives on 
the atonal works thoroughly. Not only are the major analytical models 
presented, but the critical socio-historical explanations by writers such as Adorno are also represented. Schoenberg&rsquo;s own writings, particularly those 
representing his theoretical works such as the <i>Theory of Harmony</i>, are 
also reported on extensively. These writings are particularly useful in 
understanding the transition from the late tonal works to the early atonal 
period, and Simms does not fail to make the necessary connections. </p>
<p>[8] Various theoretical models have been applied to the 
works of Schoenberg&rsquo;s atonal period over the years. Some of these readings have 
insisted on an expanded model of tonality to account for not only isolated local 
harmony but formal structure as well. Hugo Leichentritt&rsquo;s nearly contemporaneous 
analysis is perhaps the first of these, but later authors such as Will Ogdon and 
Reinhold Brinkmann continue to pursue such a model especially with the formally 
more traditional pieces such as Op. 11. Simms reports on these models as well as 
on such later models as set theory (as espoused by Allen Forte in <i>The 
Structure of Atonal Music </i>and elsewhere). Another prominent view of these 
works is that they are contextual, free atonal works that cannot be bound 
together by the structural formalisms Allen Forte proposes. George Perle, Robert 
Morgan and Ethan Haimo are representative of this view. Simms presents and 
acknowledges each of these perspectives. He is careful to never take sides, 
although clearly these perspectives are all fundamentally at odds with one 
another and their opposition has a history all of its own. While I do not 
believe taking sides would strengthen Simms&rsquo; own book in any way, I could 
imagine a more developed discussion of the basic philosophical differences these 
camps represent. I could also imagine a more critical discussion of each of 
these models as a way of amplifying the reception history of these pieces. The 
reception history of these pieces is, by and large, the analytical literature. 
Concert audiences have mostly ignored these works, but writers such as Leichentritt, Forte, and Perle have preserved their importance for the next 
century. There are profound discrepancies between these views as well as 
critical volleys both implicit and explicit that have been fired back and forth. 
As a musicologist with expertise in this area, Bryan Simms could be invaluable 
in assessing the critical history of that analytical literature at this point. 
Such an assessment would require a greater degree of interpretive synthesis than 
the strict journalistic accounting that is presented here, though. I don&rsquo;t 
believe such a discussion would diminish the focus on Schoenberg or the music 
itself. Instead, it would make that discussion richer. Prof. Simms introduces 
this body of analytical literature into his discussion, but treats it so 
neutrally that I cannot help but wonder about what his own analytical views of 
this music are. His own analyses stick largely to observations about the form of 
pieces and to characterization of their textures. They are basically narrative 
descriptions, but may be especially useful as starting points for readers who 
will then want to venture into the more detailed analytical literature that 
surrounds these works.</p>
<p>[9] In conclusion, <i>The 
Atonal Music of Arnold Schoenberg</i> is a highly useful addition to the 
literature on Schoenberg. It provides an accounting of Schoenberg&rsquo;s development 
during the atonal period that is especially rich in biographical detail and 
historical context. While very little synthesis and almost no new analysis is 
presented here, the author is extremely diligent in describing the important 
analytical work surrounding this literature and especially in relating 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s own writings to the music. The context that Bryan Simms unfolds 
here will be indispensable for all theorists and musicologists who wish to 
interpret these works and their history.</p>
