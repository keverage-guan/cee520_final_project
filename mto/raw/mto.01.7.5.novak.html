<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] This volume is part of a continuing series of books designed to promote the 
understanding of composers and their work. The fifteen scholars who contributed to 
the book appear well qualified to undertake such an endeavor concerning the 
music of B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k. The volume succeeds in two principal areas. The first 
area, which one should expect from a book called a &ldquo;companion,&rdquo; is the 
discussion of the origin, style, and reception of a great many of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s works, and 
their relationship to one other. The other area of contribution is found 
in several essays which deal with the relationship of Bart&oacute;k and his music to 
the political histories of Hungary and  Europe. </p>
<p>[2]
While the book succeeds in presenting the principal issues of Bart&oacute;k studies to 
the uninitiated, it fails to present much that is new for those readers who are 
already knowledgeable in the area. The collection could be likened more to a 
mirror that reflects what is known and seen, rather than to a door through which 
new possibilities may be found. In addition, the book contains nearly as much 
discussion of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s early works as it does his later, more characteristic works. 
This emphasis seems unwarranted, even if it is an intentional reaction to 
previous studies that more or less dismiss Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s early style.</p>
<p>[3]
In &ldquo;The Political and Cultural Climate in Hungary at the Turn of the Twentieth 
Century,&rdquo; Lynne Hooker aims to dispel the notion that Bart&oacute;k was a nostalgic 
Nationalist. After contrasting the cultures of the urban areas (which were 
largely Germanic and Jewish in origin) to the myriad of cultures found in rural 
Hungary, Hooker points out that the growing population of nationalistic 
chauvinists at this time were either indifferent to or ignorant of the actual 
cultures of the Hungarian peoples, as brought to light at the 1896 Millennium 
Exhibition in Budapest.</p>
<p>[4]
Stephen Ederly deals with Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s collecting of folksongs, the methodology of 
which was actually based on a Finnish system of comparative musicology. Ederly 
uses primary and secondary sources and compiles the information in a large graph 
of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s collecting endeavors from the many regions in Hungary as well as 
from other nations. The most original contribution here is probably the 
introductory segment where Ederly traces the history of the Gypsy-influenced <i>Verbunkos</i> 
style, which urbanites mistook for genuine Hungarian folk music.</p>
<p>[5]
David Cooper explores Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s orchestral music and elucidates its modernist 
qualities. He concentrates mostly on his first and last orchestral works: the Straussian <i>Kossuth</i> Symphony and the  Concerto for Orchestra, although he 
discusses other works as well. In his excellent investigation of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s three 
works for the stage, Carl Leafstedt finds a common theme of loneliness. 
Although, Leafstedt does not manage to substantiate his hypothesis that the 
composer was plagued by this emotion, this does not altogether nullify the theme 
of this insightful article. Rachel Beckles Willson finds Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s vocal 
offerings to be stylistically rather conservative, with the exception of the 
<i>Village Scenes</i> and the <i>Cantata Profana</i>, whose motivically developed styles go 
beyond the simple arrangement of folksongs.</p>
<p>[6]
The volume contains three essays on Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s piano music. Victoria Fischer 
concentrates on Bart&oacute;k as a pedagogue and presents a catalogue of articulation 
marks which he devised for his own edition of <i>Notebook for Anna Magdalena 
Bach</i>. An important theme here (and one which might have been investigated 
further) is the relevance of the original text of folksongs (which were usually 
not included by the composer) to the dramatic aspects of interpretation in Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s many piano works based on folksongs. Susan Bradshaw&rsquo;s partly analytical 
discussion of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s piano music is repeatedly marred by her overly creative 
terminology that obscures meaning. For instance, she speaks of &ldquo;octave-based 
chords&rdquo; and the &ldquo;rolling reiterations of an intermittently formulaic bass.&rdquo; Vera 
Lampert&rsquo;s essay extemporizes on Bart&oacute;k as an interpretive pianist whose generous 
rubato was akin to that of other master pianists of the turn of the century. 
Although we benefit greatly from the recordings that he left behind, Lampert 
emphasizes that Bart&oacute;k thought of his works not as finished masterworks, but as 
a living entities that ought to differ with each new performer and each new 
performance. The author also stresses that Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s playing was not particularly 
percussive even though his works employed the piano in a percussive manner. She 
provides an amusing anecdote which involved Bart&oacute;k correcting a student&rsquo;s 
bombastic interpretation. The composer pleaded, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t play it in such a Bart&oacute;kian manner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>[7]
Nicky Loesseff satisfactorily explores the dramatic elements of the piano 
concertos and the  Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, while Peter Laki 
characterizes the violin works as having a distinct &ldquo;warm&rdquo; and melodic stylistic 
thread that draws across all periods of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s career. In the collection&rsquo;s longest 
essay, Amanda Bayley (also the volume&rsquo;s editor) encapsulates for the reader many 
principal issues of the pithy string quartets, covering topics such as quartal 
harmony, intervallic expansion and compression, semitonal juxtaposition, 
bimodality, and the generation of harmony from melody, as well as the influence 
of Hungarian national and folk idioms. </p>
<p>[8]
The most engaging essays of the volume are found in the third and final part, 
which is dedicated to the reception of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s music. David E. Schneider traces 
Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s quick rise to fame with the tone poem <i>Kossuth</i>, followed later by the 
public&rsquo;s distrust of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s cosmopolitan interests as well as a 
misunderstanding of his conscientious move from clich&eacute;d &ldquo;gypsy&rdquo; influences to 
true peasant Hungarian sources. In the 1920s, the important Hungarian writers Antal Moln&aacute;r and Alad&aacute;r T&oacute;th did much to make a case for Bart&oacute;k as the prototype 
of a progressive Hungarian national. Ironically, a communist governmental 
initiative in the year 1934 that increased budgetary support of folk culture 
helped Bart&oacute;k to regain his status in his later years. Malcolm Gillies&rsquo; essay 
dispels the widely-held myth that Bart&oacute;k was misunderstood and mistreated by 
America, as he favorably compares Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s means in America with those of other 
composers and points to the abundance of folk music research that Bart&oacute;k 
produced in his American years.</p>
<p>[9]
Although most post-World War II German critics believed Bartok&rsquo;s music to be 
compromised for not following the musical thought of Schoenberg, Danielle 
Fosler-Lussier traces the lectures and essays of the Darmstadt school for both 
support and criticism of Bart&oacute;k. At this time, the West confused Bartok&rsquo;s 
musical accessibility with the musical style of Soviet idealism, while at home 
in communist Hungary, the same music was under fire for evidencing Western 
&ldquo;bourgeois decadence.&rdquo; The criticisms on both sides resulted in a dichotomy of 
Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s output, i.e., different works were being performed in Hungary than 
abroad. </p>
<p>[10]
Ivan F. Waldbauer&rsquo;s essay on analytical responses to Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s music is a cogent 
summary of the history of Bart&oacute;k analysis. The author finds six different pitch 
theories directed towards Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s oeuvre. Waldbauer summarizes theories of 
Edwin von der N&uuml;ll, Ern&ouml; Lendvai, Milton Babbitt, George Perle, Roy Travis, 
J&aacute;nos K&aacute;rp&aacute;ti, Elliott Antokoletz, Paul Wilson among others, and examines the 
level of self-containment of the various theories, as well as their relationship 
to traditional tonal systems. The author&rsquo;s neglect of the rigorous analytical 
writings of Malcolm Gillies appears to this reviewer as an oversight.</p>
<p>[11]
It is difficult not to compare the <i>Cambridge Companion to Bart&oacute;k</i> 
with Oxford&rsquo;s <i>Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s Perspectives</i>, which came into print only a year earlier. (This 
reviewer hesitates to compare the two since he has contributed to the Oxford 
volume.) Although the two volumes actually share four authors, it appears that 
the premise of the Cambridge book, in which the authors appear to be more or 
less assigned specific musical genres of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s output, necessarily limits not 
only the topics of the essays, but also the amount of detail that the authors 
could provide. Therefore, the essays of the <i>Companion</i> appear in general to be 
less original and their analyses less probing than those of the Oxford volume.</p>
