<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The American Mathematical Society&rsquo;s 2003 Spring Southeastern Section 
Conference was held Friday&ndash;Sunday, March 14&ndash;16, on the campus of Louisiana State 
University in Baton Rouge. It included a special session, &ldquo;Mathematical 
Techniques in Musical Analysis,&rdquo; which featured the work of twenty music 
theorists and mathematicians. The session organizers were Robert Peck, Assistant 
Professor of Music Theory at Louisiana State University; and Judith Baxter, 
Director of the Liberal Arts and Sciences Academic Advising Center and member of 
the faculty of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science 
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The entire special session was divided 
into four presentation sessions: Friday afternoon, Saturday morning, Saturday 
afternoon, and Sunday morning.</p>
<p>
[2] The first presentation session opened with remarks by Ronald Ross, Dean of 
the College of Music and Dramatic Arts at Louisiana State University. Dean Ross 
welcomed the presenters and other conference attendees, and announced the 
acceptance of funding for the formation of LSU CAPITAL, a center for 
interdisciplinary studies of the arts and digital technology at Louisiana State 
University. Following Dean Ross, Robert Peck <a href="mailto:(rpeck@lsu.edu">
(rpeck@lsu.edu</a>) gave the first presentation of the special session, 
&ldquo;Introduction to the Special Session: An Overview of Mathematical Techniques in 
Musical Analysis.&rdquo; Peck provided a general historical outline of mathematical 
techniques in musical analysis, concentrating primarily on those aspects of 
acoustics, set theory, and group theory that would be amplified in later 
presentations.</p>
<p>
[3] The next speaker was Stephen Soderberg <a href="mailto:(ssod@loc.gov">
(ssod@loc.gov</a>) of the Library of Congress. Soderberg&rsquo;s paper, &ldquo;The 
Impossible Coin Toss,&rdquo; presented the problem of finding a unified solution to 
the Z-related set problem. He traced the history of the theory of Z-relations, 
citing Milton Babbitt&rsquo;s Generalized Hexachord Theorem (GHT) and David Lewin&rsquo;s 
Z-related triples in modulo18. He discussed Z-relations further in terms of his 
own dual inversions, which can account for Lewin&rsquo;s modulo 18 triples, as well as 
other n-tuples in spaces of even cardinalities. However, he pointed out that 
neither the GHT nor the dual inversion solution addresses all instances of 
Z-relatedness.</p>
<p>
[4] Jack Douthett <a href="mailto:(jdouthett@tvi.cc.nm.us">
(jdouthett@tvi.cc.nm.us</a>), of TVI Community College, spoke next, about the 
concept of maximal evenness. His paper, &ldquo;Dinner Tables, the Ising Model, 
and the Piano Keyboard,&rdquo; presented the concept of maximal evenness in terms of 
guests sitting around a table at a dinner party. Specifically, Douthett asked 
how one might seat a certain number of French and American guests, so that each 
guest might enjoy conversation with neighbors from the other country. He then 
presented the question as a general mathematical problem, and pointed out how 
the solution was arrived at first as a music theoretical result in scale theory. 
He drew further analogies to the one-dimensional Ising model of physics, in 
which a maximally even distribution of upward and downward spins minimizes the 
overall energy, and to the piano keyboard&rsquo;s distribution of white and black 
keys.</p>
<p>
[5] The first presentation session concluded with the work of two graduate 
students. The first was Panayotis Mavromatis
<a href="mailto:(pm@theory.esm.rochester.edu">(pm@theory.esm.rochester.edu</a>) 
of the Eastman School of Music. Mavromatis&rsquo;s presentation, &ldquo;Minimal Description 
Length: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Music Model Building,&rdquo; provided an 
approach to oral-based musical traditions, for which no explicit documentation 
of rule systems exists or is known. These rule systems may involve such 
activities as composition, improvisation, or listening. The particular 
repertoire he considered is modern Greek church chant. Drawing on statistical 
techniques, he built a stochastic model of melody in this corpus. Specifically, 
he defined a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), using a variant of Stolcke and 
Omohundro&rsquo;s state merging algorithm, with Rissanen&rsquo;s Minimal Description Length 
(MDL) as the termination criterion. Among the questions raised after the talk 
was how this model might be used to analyze jazz improvisation.</p>
<p>
[6] The final speaker in the first presentation session was Jonathan Wild
<a href="mailto:(wild@fas.harvard.edu">(wild@fas.harvard.edu</a>), a graduate 
student at Harvard University. His talk, &ldquo;Tessellating the Chromatic,&rdquo; dealt 
with concepts related to combinatoriality as applied to pitch-space, rather than 
pitch-class space. For example, he examined how one might successively overlap 
members of one particular set-class, thereby packing, or tessellating the entire 
chromatic. He presented various types of pitch tessellation, drawing on the work 
of Coven and Meyerowitz. In terms of a compositional technique, which also has 
implications for analysis, he also examined Z-related tiles, simultaneous 
tilings of pitch and rhythm, and issues raised by other (non-twelve) 
equal-tempered spaces.</p>
<p>
[7] The second presentation session opened with a talk by Thomas Noll
<a href="mailto:(noll@cs.tu-berlin.de">(noll@cs.tu-berlin.de</a>), of the 
Technical University Berlin. His presentation was titled &ldquo;A Mathematical Model 
for Tone Apperception.&rdquo; It applied mathematical concepts to apperception 
psychology, as a means of modeling musical ambiguity. Drawing on ideas of 
Wilhelm Wundt (such as Wundt&rsquo;s eye metaphor), Noll described apperception in 
terms of inner vision, wherein ideas enter the scope of attention either 
passively or actively. This process may be modeled via a symplectic geometry. It 
has implications for Riemann&rsquo;s musical motion metaphors, Lewin&rsquo;s GIS-model, 
Gollin&rsquo;s transformational approach to enharmonicity, and Meeus&rsquo; Neo-Rameauean 
approach to tonal progressions. Specifically, Noll invoked the discrete subgroup 
of integral symplectic matrices SL<sub>2</sub>(Z), wherein the upper triangle matrix 
corresponds to the &ldquo;passive fifth step&rdquo; (e.g., I/I -&gt; V/I), while the lower 
triangle matrix corresponds to the &ldquo;active fifth shift&rdquo; (e.g., I/I -&gt; I/V).</p>
<p>
[8] The second presenter was Adrian Childs
<a href="mailto:(apchilds@arches.uga.edu">(apchilds@arches.uga.edu</a>) of the 
University of Georgia. In his presentation, &ldquo;Structural and Transformational 
Properties of All-Interval Tetrachords,&rdquo; he spoke about the all-interval 
tetrachords (4-Z15 and 4-Z29) not in terms of their Z-relatedness, but rather in 
terms of their all-interval construction. He went on to define a common-tone 
transformational scheme that results from the partitioning of the tetrachords 
over the set of interval-classes. He demonstrated further how certain tonal and 
octatonic properties of these tetrachords may function as a means of generating 
musical growth processes, using excerpts from his own composition <i>Shadows 
Numberless</i>.</p>
<p>
[9] Next was a presentation by Clifton Callender
<a href="mailto:(callen_c@cmr.fsu.edu">(callen_c@cmr.fsu.edu</a>) of Florida 
State University. His talk was titled &ldquo;Continuous Functions in Musical Spaces.&rdquo; 
Instead of dealing with finite quotients of the familiar pitch-, time-, and 
tempo-continua (equally tempered pitch-space, even pulse-space, etc.), his 
presentation involved the infinite spectra of such domains. First discussing 
pitch, he provided various analytic perspectives of Kaija Saariaho&rsquo;s <i>Vers le 
blanc</i> (IRCAM, 1982). He went on to demonstrate how similar techniques could be 
applied to trajectories in modular rhythm and tempo set-class spaces, using 
Nancarrow&rsquo;s Study No. 22 and his own Canon as examples of the latter techniques.</p>
<p>
[10] The second presentation session concluded with two talks on scale theory. 
David Clampitt <a href="mailto:(david.clampitt@yale.edu">(david.clampitt@yale.edu</a>) 
of Yale University gave the first, &ldquo;Number Theory and Music Theory: Recent 
Extensions in Music Theory of the Three Gap Theorem.&rdquo; His presentation examined 
the implications of the Three Gap Theorem in music scale theory. Specifically, 
the Three Gap Theorem (proven by V. T. Sós in 1958) states that, for a finite 
set of consecutive integer multiples of a real number modulo 1, the &ldquo;gaps&rdquo; or 
distances between successive elements come in at most three sizes. Several 
familiar music scalar constructions display this property. For example, 
following a particular proof of Myhill&rsquo;s Property, Clampitt demonstrated how the 
white-key diatonic and the black-key pentatonic collections are both examples of 
scales in which generic steps come in just two sizes.</p>
<p>
[11] The last presentation in this session was by Norman Carey
<a href="mailto:(ncarey@esm.rochester.edu">(ncarey@esm.rochester.edu</a>) of the 
Eastman School of Music (Jeffrey Perry of Louisiana State University read 
Carey&rsquo;s paper, as Carey could not be present). Carey&rsquo;s talk, &ldquo;The Coherence 
Index in Well-Formed and Pair-Wise Well-Formed Scales,&rdquo; furthered certain ideas 
introduced by Clampitt in the previous presentation. Specifically, Carey 
introduced the notion of &ldquo;coherence&rdquo; in well-formed and pair-wise well-formed 
scales. Such coherence is measured in terms of a Coherence Index: for any set of 
N elements modulo 1, the set is coherent if, for all n, all intervals of span n 
are smaller than any interval of span n+1. The result Carey drew is that 
well-formed scales are particularly more coherent than the average collection, 
and he demonstrated the specific ways in which incoherence is limited in 
pair-wise well-formed scales.</p>
<p>
[12] The third presentation session opened with a talk by Richard Cohn
<a href="mailto:(r-cohn@uchicago.edu">(r-cohn@uchicago.edu</a>) of the 
University of Chicago. Cohn&rsquo;s presentation, &ldquo;A Tetrahedral Model of Tetrachordal 
Voice-Leading Space,&rdquo; replaced his scheduled talk on LPR sentences. It consisted 
primarily of new work in progress, for which Cohn solicited feedback from the 
audience. Specifically, departing from earlier work by Joseph Straus and Ian 
Quinn, Cohn constructed a five-level tetrahedral graph of various parsimonious 
and transpositionally combinatorial relations among the set of all tetrachordal 
set-classes. The base of this pyramidal graph and its two subsequent lower 
levels model P2 relations, while adjacent links between these levels incorporate 
P1 relations. The upper levels and their links display transpositional 
combination shadows and metashadows. The tetrahedron, as viewed from various 
perspectives, demonstrates certain symmetries among the set of tetrachordal 
set-classes.</p>
<p>
[13] The second speaker was Jonathan Kochavi
<a href="mailto:(kochavi@acsu.buffalo.edu">(kochavi@acsu.buffalo.edu</a>) of the 
University of Buffalo. (Edward Gollin, who was scheduled to present next in this 
session, cancelled his talk, as he was unable to attend.) Kochavi&rsquo;s presentation 
was titled &ldquo;An Algebraic Classification of Contextually Defined Musical 
Inversions.&rdquo; In it, he generalized the concept of contextual inversion in terms 
of the three parsimonious neo-Riemannian operators. Then, adjoining these 
contextual inversions to normal transposition, he defined various transformation 
groups, all of order twenty-four. Finally, he examined the various algebraic 
structures among these transformation groups, and presented musical contexts for 
each.</p>
<p>
[14] Next, Julian Hook <a href="mailto:(juhook@indiana.edu">(juhook@indiana.edu</a>) 
of Penn State University (now of Indiana University) gave a presentation, 
&ldquo;Uniform Triadic Transformations: A Wreath Product in Music Theory.&rdquo; Hook&rsquo;s talk 
dealt with a group of 288 uniform transformations on consonant triads. 
Specifically, a uniform triadic transformation (UTT) is represented by an 
ordered triple &lt;&#963;,t+,t-&gt;, in which &#963; represents either the preservation of, or 
change of, a triad&rsquo;s mode; t+ represents its transposition on major triads; and 
t- represents its transposition on minor triads. The uniformity condition states 
that a UTT transforms all major triads consistently, and also transforms all 
minor triads in a consistent way. He demonstrated how the familiar Riemannian 
group of schritts and wechsels forms a subgroup of this transformation group, 
pointing out how the UTTs reflect their characteristic Riemannian dualism. In 
addition to other simply transitive subgroups, he also defined a larger group Q 
that contains the familiar inversion operations, transformations on non-triadic 
set-classes, and some diatonic and serial applications.</p>
<p>
[15] The third presentation session concluded with a talk by Michael Buchler
<a href="mailto:(michael.buchler@music.fsu.edu">(michael.buchler@music.fsu.edu</a>) 
of Florida State University. His presentation was titled &ldquo;Notions of Equivalence 
and Similarity in Atonal Music Theory.&rdquo; He started by describing how, in the 
absence of a system such as tonality, composers in the twentieth century turned 
to other means of projecting coherence and continuity in their music. As a 
result, music theorists have devised various means of measuring notions of 
equivalence and similarity in music. He provided a general survey of these types 
of measurements, focusing largely on their emphasis on either object-driven 
similarity or transformation-driven similarity.</p>
<p>
[16] The last presentation session began with the work of two graduate students 
at the Eastman School of Music. The first was Richard Randall
<a href="mailto:(randall@theory.esm.rochester.edu">
(randall@theory.esm.rochester.edu</a>), whose presentation was titled &ldquo;Music, 
Models, and the Relative Complexity of Analysis.&rdquo; Departing from Casti, he 
described the complexity of a musical analysis as the degree of interaction 
between the musical objects being analyzed and the particular analytical 
methodology employed. He defined analysis as an ordered triple A = &lt;S,M,Z&gt;, 
where S is a set of objects to be analyzed, M is the analytical methodology, and 
Z is the set of states that characterize S in terms of M. He went on to define 
comparative analysis of degrees of interaction as an ordered triple C = &lt;S,M,Z&gt;, 
where now S is a set of A&rsquo;s as above.</p>
<p>
[17] The second presenter in this session was Ian Quinn
<a href="mailto:(iquinn@uchicago.edu">(iquinn@uchicago.edu</a>), who is 
completing a visiting position at the University of Chicago (and joining the 
University of Oregon). Quinn&rsquo;s presentation, &ldquo;Chord Quality and General 
Harmony,&rdquo; presented many of the concepts of pitch-class set theory and 
transformation theory as discrete Fourier transforms. In particular, he defined 
a group of operators that includes transposition (T), inversion (I), 
multiplication by 5 modulo 12 (M), and pcset complementation (C). Then, he 
presented a planar graph generated by the above transforms, in which nodes 
represent pcsets, and edges represent parsimonious and quasi-parsimonious 
voice-leading motions between pcsets. He defined various measurements in this 
plane, including a &ldquo;lewin,&rdquo; which serves as the standard length.</p>
<p>
[18] After a break for one of the conference&rsquo;s keynote addresses (Günther Lumer 
of the University of Mons-Hainaut), the final presentation session of the 
special session concluded with three talks. The first was by Eytan Agmon
<a href="mailto:(agmone@mail.biu.ac.il">(agmone@mail.biu.ac.il</a>) of Bar-Ilan 
University. Agmon&rsquo;s presentation, &ldquo;Numbers and the Western Tone-System,&rdquo; 
departed from concepts in psychoacoustics. Specifically, he noted that we use a 
logarithmic function of frequency to measure (equally tempered) pitch, and that 
certain ratios of frequencies, particularly simpler ratios, have special 
auditory status. He noted how these psychoacoustical properties do not always 
correlate to Western notions of musical space. That is, while such acoustic 
measures function as real numbers, much of our experience with music is in terms 
of integers. Musical pitches can be so modeled in terms of chromatic space 
(specific) and diatonic space (generic). To that end, he devised a triple, (C,p,rate(p)), 
in which C is a core pitch as a specific/generic integer pair, p is any real 
number, and rate(p) is a measurement of the &ldquo;in-tune-ness&rdquo; of p to C.</p>
<p>
[19] The next presentation was by John Rahn
<a href="mailto:(jrahn@u.washington.edu">(jrahn@u.washington.edu</a>) of the 
University of Washington. Rahn&rsquo;s talk was titled &ldquo;Some Recent Developments in 
Mathematics Applied to Music Theory.&rdquo; Rahn presented summaries of two large and 
significant contributions to the field of mathematics and the arts. The first 
book he discussed was Guerino Mazzola&rsquo;s <i>The Topos of Music</i> (1999). Drawing on Mazzola&rsquo;s earlier work, this book puts forth a classification theory of musical 
objects. It contains further topologies for various musical domains, including 
melody, rhythm, and harmony, especially in the contexts of counterpoint and 
modulation. It also deals significantly with a theory of musical performance; 
using Lie algebra, it extends its concepts to object-oriented software 
environments. The second book Rahn discussed was Michael Leyton&rsquo;s <i>A Generative 
Theory of Shape</i> (2001). Dealing not only with music but with the arts in 
general, Leyton&rsquo;s book presents a theory of (complex) shape with regard to two 
properties of intelligence: transfer of structure and recoverability of the 
generative operations, with the ultimate goal of deriving understandability from 
complexity. To this end, Leyton defines a class of unfolding groups, which 
&ldquo;unfold&rdquo; complex shapes from their maximally collapsed versions.</p>
<p>
[20] The final presentation was of work by Ciro Scotto
<a href="mailto:(cscotto@esm.rochester.edu">(cscotto@esm.rochester.edu</a>) and 
Robert Morris <a href="mailto:(mris@mail.rochester.edu">(mris@mail.rochester.edu</a>), 
both of the Eastman School of Music. Scotto gave the presentation, &ldquo;Aspects of 
Saturation and Ordering in Twelve-Tone Music,&rdquo; which consisted of two parts. One 
part of the talk dealt with aspects of saturation in twelve-tone structures. 
Specifically, Morris and Scotto sought to construct all-hexachord rows and/or 
rings, in a manner similar to Berg&rsquo;s all-interval row and Babbitt&rsquo;s all-trichord 
row. They presented various fifty-five note structures that contain all the 
hexachords, including fifty-five note rows which omit one pitch-class. The 
second part of the talk focused on self-replicating rows, which contain 
transformed versions of themselves embedded within the row. Arrays and cycles of 
twelve-tone operators play an important role in generating the latter type of 
structures.</p>
<p>
[21] The special session attracted a certain amount of interest among the 
mathematicians at the meeting, and at times was attended by a number of outside 
interested parties. Based on its success, Peck and Baxter have proposed another 
special session for the American Mathematical Society/Mathematical Association 
of America national meeting, which will take place January 7-10, 2004, in 
Phoenix, Arizona. This subsequent session has been accepted by the conference 
program committee, and further information is available via the AMS website (<a href="http://www.ams.org">http://www.ams.org</a>),
