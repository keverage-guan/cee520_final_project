<p>[1.1] Bracketed above <b>Example 1</b> is
the opening phrase of Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s &ldquo;Change of Time,&rdquo; <i>Mikrokosmos</i>
 #126.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> If we take the composer&rsquo;s barring as the perceived meter (and I will
argue shortly why we might do so), we must also note that from a traditional
perspective it is highly irregular, lacking periodicity both at the level of
downbeat (there is no single duple or triple meter) and at the level of the
tactus (there is no single quarter or eighth pulse). Nonetheless, there is
strong contextual evidence for hearing downbeats where they are indicated, for
these timepoints mark at bars 2, 3, and 4 a stepwise descending line <nobr><nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>&ndash;A&ndash;G,</nobr>
each of which is preceded by ascending stepwise motion and where G is heard as a
consonant arrival in the C-dominated vocabulary. Such a &ldquo;radical&rdquo;
reading<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> places downbeats after three, four, five, or six eighths, truly a
&ldquo;change of time&rdquo;!<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>[1.2] While such a description (4 + 6 + 3 + 5) may accurately
describe the &ldquo;end result&rdquo; of our perceptions, it misses how we might
arrive there. If we were to consider the <i>process</i> of coming to this reading
we might note that the passage begins in a considerably more periodic way than
it ends. I borrow Christopher Hasty&rsquo;s terminology to describe how we might begin
to count by threes.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> When we come to understand <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> as a beginning (a
perception first created by its registral status, lending to the previous two
quarters an anacrustic character), we may connect &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-as-beginning&rdquo;
with the next beginning, the quarter-note, A. The characterization of A as a
beginning arises from its stepwise connection with <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, its longer duration,
and its appearance after eighth notes. Because &ldquo;A-as-beginning&rdquo;
follows &ldquo;<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>-as-beginning&rdquo; at a distance of three quarters, we may
come to expect a third beginning three quarters hence. In this regard, G&rsquo;s
&ldquo;early&rdquo; arrival is a surprise (after all, only one and a half quarters
have passed since A began), and we may initially regard this pitch as a
syncopation. But as the music continues, strong evidence emerges that this G (at
the start of notated bar 4) may in fact have <i>become</i> a beginning. Its new
identity comes forth as a second quarter-note G reinforces this pitch&rsquo;s
stability, and as the reappearance of the opening material immediately
thereafter confirms the start of another phrase and another counting process.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 2</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="horlacher_examples.php?id=1&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 2 thumbnail" src="horlacher_ex2_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch animation)</font></p></div>

<p>[1.3] The arrows below <b>Example 2</b>,
drawn from Hasty&rsquo;s usage, illustrate this sequence of events.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> The solid
arches appear gradually with each new beginning, and are ended by the next new beginning. In other words, they move through the present. The
dotted arches represent the immediate future: they identify our expectations for
new beginnings in the forthcoming music, based on our immediately previous
experience. The dotted arches appear in full as each solid arch is ended by a
new beginning. Thus, the notations at written bar 4 indicate that our decision
to hear the first G as a beginning may be retrospective, graphically indicated
by the &ldquo;x&rdquo; drawn through the dotted arch. The point is not only that
we may <i>come</i> to consider this pitch another beginning, allowing us to
label it a downbeat despite its early appearance, but also that this realization
enhances G&rsquo;s quality: we appreciate the excitement of reaching the goal pitch on
a downbeat, but well before we expected it.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> When G comes too soon, it gives
the phrase an energetic lilt.</p>
<p>[1.4] In this article I will describe a <i> processive</i> approach to
metrical irregularity, differentiating it from readings where irregularity takes
place within the context of <i>fixed</i> metrical identity. This kind of
approach emphasizes the <i>evolution</i> of meter, and underscores
our active engagement with the flow of time: our involvement extends beyond
marking timepoints as strong and weak to include emerging qualitative
characterizations of timespans. When meter is &ldquo;irregular,&rdquo; we are
particularly aware of time as more or less energetic or driven (or at the other
end of the spectrum, as more or less relaxed or flaccid). For example, when we
evaluate an event both as early <i>and</i> as having the potential to be
accented, we allow its irregularity to assume a substantive role: we permit its
unique qualities to participate in creating continuity. Our concern is not
directed solely toward the maintenance of equal timespans, but rather on how
events shape those spans, both as we come upon the events and as we subsequently
reinterpret them. As a consequence, events designated as downbeats may not feel
exactly the same: as an event that arrives early becomes accented (i.e., becomes
a downbeat), its placement colors our perception of the time world it inhabits.
Thus, in the opening phrase, G&rsquo;s early arrival, coupled with the ease with which
we resume earlier counting, is a mild jolt, and sets the stage for a piece that
is prone to reinterpretation and re-evaluation.</p>
<p>[1.5] By contrast, fixed approaches to irregularity tend to feature breaks in
a pattern either as momentary disruptions whose value is local, or, if the
breaks are persistent, as creators of a new (but fixed) regularity. In the first
case, momentary disruptions are described as metrical dissonances that decorate
an underlying metrical consonance.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> In the second, a metrical irregularity is
recast as part of a new and ongoing stream of metrical accent. This second case
is commonly described as a metrical elision (in other words, the renaming of a
point of time from strong to weak, or the reverse). An elision merely marks the
point at which a predominant counting resumes, notably leaving aside any residue
from the disruption.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>[1.6] Some models of metrical irregularity feature unique mixes of fixed and
processive perspectives, allowing for special modes of counting in special
situations. For example, Andrew Imbrie&rsquo;s conservative-radical distinction offers
the notion that careful listeners might disagree where a metrical break occurs.
A conservative listener who maintains an original meter as long as possible is drawn into a considerably longer process of re-evaluation than the
radical, who lets go at the first opportunity. What happens during the
re-evaluation may be very similar to what I am describing as processive
counting. In another approach, William Rothstein describes unique spans of time
where one might <i>suspend</i> regular counting, proposing that when phrases are
expanded, we may momentarily let go of a predominant hypermeter in order to
follow a temporary one during an expansion, and that we may return to the
suspended hypermeter when the expansion is over. Suspending hypermeter permits a
metrical irregularity that arises from phrase expansion to generate its own
structure, while at the same time preserving intact the predominant (or fixed)
earlier meter. More complex are those models that describe large-scale hemiolas.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup>These approaches compare fixed but competing interpretations over spans of music
that are
typically at least several bars in length. In so doing, the readings direct our
attention to a span in its entirety, reinforcing the fixed identity of each
reading. A processive approach, on the other hand, replaces the binary choice of strong or
weak with ongoing multiple possibility, valuing the <i>act</i> of metrical
evolution and re-evaluation over any ultimate <i>choice</i> of identity.</p>
<p>[1.7] In this article, I shall use Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s &ldquo;Change of Time&rdquo; to
demonstrate these differences, offering several readings of the opening
irregularity, as well as the <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>5</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> music in the second part of the piece,
to draw the distinctions into sharper view. I suggest that in the processive
reading we understand Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s title &ldquo;Change of Time&rdquo; to refer not
only to alternating patterns of time signatures, but also to changes in the <i>nature</i>
of the piece&rsquo;s time, especially as <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>5</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> &ldquo;time&rdquo; emerges more
fully in the latter part of the piece. In this light, metrical
&ldquo;irregularity&rdquo; serves as an agent, rather than a disruptor, of
continuity: we enjoy Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s piece because we learn how to count.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[2] Before and After</b></p>

<p>[2.1] Let us now consider what happens <i>after</i> we identify G as a
beginning. Below bar 4 on Example 2
the dotted arch is followed by a question mark to indicate that our anticipation
of a beginning three quarters hence has been considerably weakened by the
interrupting G. As a beginning, it has entered <i>so</i> early that it
significantly cuts off the emerging potential begun at bar 3, and leaves us
somewhat of a loss. Or more positively, we might claim to be more open to
changing circumstances provided by the return of the opening anacrustic gesture.
Because this opening gesture now has a well-defined identity, its return helps
us to anticipate the next beginning. The return also has larger, more important
consequences. Because F and G at notated bar 5 are <i>not</i> a beginning
(rather, they lead to a beginning), they may become attached to the previous
beginning, the interrupting G at notated bar 4 (on Example
2 the solid arch continues through bar 5). In this way, F and G participate
in the emergence of a <i>new</i> span, shown by the longer, solid arch
underneath the denied, dotted arch at bar 4. The new solid arch measures a
distance of nine eighths between G-as-beginning and the next beginning at
notated bar 6.</p>
<p>[2.2] This reading has important ramifications: if we carry this new span of
nine eighths forward at the start of bar 6, we are rewarded rather than
surprised by the &ldquo;interrupting G&rdquo; the second time around (in the
second phrase at bar 8). On Example 2,
the dotted arch leading to bar 8 is augmented by a solid one, and in turn that
solid arch gives rise to the next anticipated beginning (shown by the last
dotted arch.) In other words, our experience of G&rsquo;s arrival may be quite
different the second time than the first: if we allow ourselves to follow the
new possibilities that arise out of the first phrase, we are more prepared to
expect the next &ldquo;interruption,&rdquo; or at least to be less distracted by
it, for we may have come to value beginnings that occur every nine eighths.</p>
<p>[2.3] But what of the earlier span of three quarters? When the durational and
melodic patterns of phrase one return in phrase two, can it be that triple
counting has disappeared entirely? In this processive reading, the start of the
second phrase (bars 6 and 7) contrasts with the piece&rsquo;s opening. It is not that
the opening triple projection (and its subsequent denial) are absent the second
time around, but that this activity is now inflected by the piece&rsquo;s
continuation. The beginning of the second phrase at notated bar 6 is marked
by moving, solid arches <i>both</i> six and nine eighths in length. Because the
span of nine has been recently anticipated (as shown by the dotted arch above
the solid one) it is therefore a <i>stronger</i> suggestion. Note how bar 7
contrasts with bar 3: bar 7 suggests a lengthening of the original three
quarters by three eighths, a reading that differs with the metrically uncertain
bar 3.</p>
<p>[2.4] The second phrase, then, is not merely a repetition of the first, but a
development where the second phrase both draws and comments upon the metrical
issues raised by the first: the phrases are joined by the emergence of <i>two</i>
viable projective potentials (counting by six and by nine) where the second
enhances and extends the first both as rhythmic and formal consequent.</p>

<p>[2.5] Let us now turn to three alternative readings where metrical identity
is fixed. In <b>Example 3A</b> I have
rebarred the phrase entirely in <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr>. In this &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; reading
one continues to count periodically, thereby hearing both G&rsquo;s as syncopations.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> Although the counter is rewarded for holding onto triple meter
when the second phrase begins on target,<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> the opening phrase is <i>qualitatively</i>
quite different: its goal pitch is weakened by arriving twice in metrically weak
locations. I might characterize it as more unsettled than sprightly. More
importantly, the second phrase proceeds exactly as the first did: its
designation as a consequent phrase arises only from our recognition of the
sequential pitch structure rather than from emerging metrical experience.</p>
<p>[2.6] Alternately, in <b>Example 3B</b> I
have used dots to replicate the composer&rsquo;s barring, adapting Lerdahl and
Jackendoff&rsquo;s usage as I myself have suggested in an earlier article.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> In that
paper, I suggested a model where breaks in periodicity may occur at the low
levels of tactus and barline through the mechanism of metrical elision. A
reinterpretation of a beat from weak to strong is shown by a circled dot, and
the opposite action, from strong to weak, is shown by an empty circle followed
by an arrow indicating the new location of the strong beat. Example
3B interprets the first G in bar 4 as being irregular at several levels of
meter, all at once: it is a beat that arrives late (as we reinterpret the
preceding F as part of a beat) <i>and</i> a downbeat that arrives early.
Hypermetrical levels are unaffected by the irregularity: note that durations of
nine eighths proceed periodically. In this reading, beats are fundamentally two
eighths long, with the possibility of being extended by an eighth; measures are
more variable, but their changing lengths are <i>contained</i> by the regular
progression of duple hypermeter.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> What differentiates this analysis most
strongly from Example 2 is that in 3B,
two fixed <i>levels</i> of meter are concurrently broken over bars 3 and 4. In
other words, 3B assumes that levels of meter are already well established. In
the processive reading, these early bars are characterized as far more unstable
because &ldquo;levels&rdquo; are not particularly well formed. (How do we know
which levels of counting have been broken?) Furthermore, in the processive
reading, the second phrase is different from the first: bars 7 and 8 (the
analogous location) are associated with two viable countings, one of which is
more strongly projected because of immediately preceding events.</p>
<p>[2.7] In both Examples 3A and 3B
we are still seeking a regular time that may be occasionally adjusted. The time
of periodicity remains at its heart <i>smooth</i>, and disruptions are
ultimately subsumed by a desire for equal proportion. In other words,
irregularities are unable to color the fundamental nature of periodic time.
&ldquo;The&rdquo; phrase (be it in its first or second representation) is not
sprightly at its core: rather, its lilt will always be understood as a negation
of periodicity.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 3C</b>. Hypermetrical Hemiola</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="horlacher_examples.php?id=4&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 3C thumbnail" src="horlacher_ex3c_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[2.8] <b>Example 3C</b> provides one more
reading, here focused on a hypermetrical level. Its second line of dots (labeled
&ldquo;6&rdquo;) represents the completely periodic reading of three measures
given in Example 3A; its third line
of dots (labeled &ldquo;9&rdquo;) shows the hypermetrical reading given in 3B,
identifying its four bars as consisting of two hypermeasures. Because eighteen
is the lowest common denominator of six and nine, the two readings arrive
jointly at the downbeat of bar 6, where the whole process will repeat once more.
Thus, Example 3C shows a
hypermetrical hemiola: eighteen eighths may be subdivided either into two groups
of nine or three groups of six. The potential for dual hypermetrical
interpretations originates in part from Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s use of a span of eighteen
eighths, for eighteen may be factored by either two (9 + 9) or three (6 + 6 +
6). The &ldquo;6&rdquo; reading (on the upper staff) is &ldquo;fully
consonant,&rdquo; dividing the span into one hypermeasure with three bars whose
internal divisions are also periodic, whereas the &ldquo;9&rdquo; reading is not
subdivided into measures.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
<p>[2.9] Because it results from two opposing parsings, this reading is not
entirely fixed. But its focus is not the moment-to-moment counting process, but
rather a &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; metrical dissonance. This dissonance relies on
one&rsquo;s apprehension of the entire eighteen eighths, directing one&rsquo;s attention to
the phrase&rsquo;s entire span rather than its inner inflections. In other words,
although it does portray spans of six and nine as interactive, Example
3C misses the <i>experience</i> of learning to anticipate six and then
(also) nine over the first two phrases, a phenomenon that recurs when Bart&oacute;k
repeats phrases one and two as three and four. That the processive counter may
once again participate in the returning tug of six, this time more fully aware
of its likely conversion into nine, and then anticipate the tug of six as the
phrase returns yet again, is key. In fact, in the processive reading, we can
come to understand the repetitions of the opening phrase as imperative for its
full rhythmic-metric appreciation. We may participate in a cycle of counting
that draws on a past of both sixes and nines, appreciating both the suggestion
and subsequent denial of <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter <i>and</i> the measure of equilibrium
provided by the periodicity of nine, allowing us each time to catch our breath
as the anacrustic gesture returns. A processive stance proposes that this
apprehension gains strength only as the music continues.</p>
<p>[2.10] Of course, how one chooses to count is a highly personal decision. The
reading each person prefers is probably influenced by a variety of factors,
including our inherent conservative or radical metrical habits, the performance
we hear, and our familiarity with Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s frequent use of metrically irregular
folk tunes. After all, each of us values periodicity more or less highly,
finding a metrical grid at times either reassuring or limiting, and it may be
that the processive reading proposed here seems implausible to some. My aim,
however, is not to limit our options but rather to pursue meter as a flexible
activity, and to set forth the processive reading as an opportunity rather than
a directive. The point is that the act of counting is not something that happens
to us, but rather something in which we actively engage, and where we are
continuously making choices. Let us see what opportunities arise as the piece
continues.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[3] Another Change of Time</b></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 4</b></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="horlacher_examples.php?id=5&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 4 thumbnail" src="horlacher_ex4_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to watch animation)</font></p></div>

<p>[3.1] After the fifth statement of the original phrase (bar 21), Bart&oacute;k
introduces a new durational and pitch pattern, characterized by repeating
statements of quarter-quarter-eighth. The origins of the pattern are not hard to
trace: the 5s replicate the final part of the original eighteen eighths. Bart&oacute;k
makes the connection particularly clear by retaining the top line pitch E across
bars 20 and 21; Example 4 marks this
connection and brackets the first statement of the antecedent-consequent 5 + 5
melody. (The reader may return to Example
1 to see the new music in its entire context.)</p>
<p>[3.2] Before tackling the emergence of 5 out of the previous pattern, let
us first consider the new music by itself (momentarily taking bar 21 as an
admittedly artificial beginning point.) The overtaking of 5 heightens the
already energetic character of this piece, a development explained best by a
processive analysis. Example 4
demonstrates. First consider the repeated durational figure
quarter-quarter-eighth by itself. The double-neighbor figure around E reinforces
the anacrustic quality of the eighth-note D<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> and identifies the E at bar 22
as a second beginning; the reappearance of E every five eighths thereafter
continuously increases the strength of E&rsquo;s identity as a beginning. On Example
4, the upper two rows of arches mark the new beginnings, events that
contrast with the beginnings in the first part of the piece in several ways.
Most obviously, the new beginnings come more quickly, giving this section an
intensified forward impetus. Furthermore, they come more regularly: gone is the
alternation of emerging 6s and 9s, replaced&mdash;ironically&mdash;by 5s.</p>
<p>[3.3] I have directed our attention to the recurring 5s, but equally
engaging is the internal make-up of this duration. Any 5 has a special
quality deriving from its inherent unequal subdivision. In this part of the
piece, the inequality comes as a lengthened continuation, meaning that the
&ldquo;second beat&rdquo; is consistently extended, and that it delays each
successive beginning by an eighth. The little &ldquo;catch&rdquo; this delay
imparts to the second section of music tempers its speed and regularity,
matching the sprightly quality of part one.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>[3.4] The regularity and speed of the new beginnings also encourage us to
anticipate larger beginnings. (In other words, &ldquo;hypermetrical&rdquo;
counting is more vivid in this section of music.) On Example
4, the pair of larger arches (below the smaller ones, and also starting at
bar 21) identifies the E in that bar as a large beginning, suggesting that we
consider its dominance to continue beyond the repetition of E in 22 to the
sequential repetition beginning at 23. The durations of 10 eighths, like those
of 5, continue smoothly until nearly the end of the piece (to be considered
shortly); in contrast with the earlier music, where durations of 9 eighths
competed with those of 6, 5s and 10s combine to impel this music forward
more directly.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup></p>

<p>[3.5] Fixed readings are more problematic in the second section. From the
periodic perspective, any <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> counting will soon disintegrate. At best, one may
count a continuous quarter pulse, as shown by the reading given in <b>Example
5A</b>. Although this unlikely construal does exhibit parallel interpretations
of each phrase, its clunky emphasis on the pitch D in each second bar misses E&rsquo;s
decoration first by G above and then by C below. The modified periodic reading
in <b>Example 5B</b> is more promising. Its
open circles on the eighth of each durational pattern suggest the little catch
we experience while waiting for the next beginning to arrive. Missing, however,
are both the process of coming to count by 5s (and eventually by 10s) as
well as our sense that these spans become more stable as they are repeated.</p>
<p>[3.6] At the risk of belaboring the reader, I wish to make one additional
brief point about the second section, shown on <b>Example
6</b>. The piece reaches its culmination at bar 32, whose arrival is prepared
not only by pitch events (i.e., the long ascending scale in the left hand) but
also by rhythmic ones. The culmination is enhanced by our awareness that the
phrase leading to bar 32 has gone on too long. Notice that the original <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>5</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> gesture (with its final anacrustic eighth) keeps reappearing from bars 27 to 31;
the anticipated response that bar 22 provided for bar 21 is postponed over and
over, and thereby greatly intensifies the rhythmic drive forward. As shown in Example
6, this effect is achieved by our twofold experience of the final bars:
while we are becoming ever more confident about beginnings that arise every 5 eighths, the larger beginnings (those every
10 eighths) are put on hold,
suspended by continuation. On Example 6,
the &ldquo;suspense&rdquo; is shown by the &ldquo;x&rdquo; that appears as each
possible larger arch fails to complete itself. When the consequent bar finally
arrives, it brings another surprise, for the C-major triad at bar 32 is itself
unique. With its unprecedented succession of 3 quarter notes, the lone <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>8</mn><mn>6</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> bar is not easily accommodated by any earlier experience. Rather it represents a
final event in the ongoing &ldquo;change of time&rdquo; that this piece
represents. This series of durations produces a true metrical
&ldquo;hiatus&rdquo;: it is as if counting itself must come to a halt (which
of course, it shortly does!).<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><b>[4] Coming Unfixed</b></p>

<p>[4.1] In some ways, a processive approach to counting is quite disarming:
when an event may be characterized in more than one way, it is as if the ground
is shifting under our feet. After all, a processive description rejects
&ldquo;the meter&rdquo; of a piece, instead favoring metrical identities that may
change as a piece proceeds and recognizing that some events emerge with clearer
identities than others. At its heart is a perspective of time not as periodic
measure, but rather as subject to constant manipulation, especially as events
come into being and pass into memory. While the demands made on the counter are
high, the benefits of counting in this way are at least twofold. First,
processive counting is especially germane to readings that emphasize meter as a
narrative device, for it suggests that one&rsquo;s attentions are directed to a
persistently changing environment where even repetitions are &ldquo;new&rdquo; and
forward reaching. A processive approach empowers meter to describe continuities
arising from change as well as those arising from repetition. Processive
readings are also especially relevant for music that is vitally
&ldquo;irregular,&rdquo; for it values such irregularities as capable of shaping
the essential nature of time within the context of a given piece.</p>
<p>[4.2] More generally, in a processive approach meter encompasses more than
measurement, for it is able to color the flow of time itself. The act of
counting reaches beyond the mere identification of metrical identity; in fact,
this binary act of choosing either weak or strong is superseded by our
anticipation of identity, and by our ongoing experiences of fulfillment, denial,
and uncertainty as a piece develops. In &ldquo;Change of Time,&rdquo; counting at
the opening is uncertain because a potential <nobr><math><msubsup><mtext></mtext><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></math></nobr> meter is consistently
interrupted, and quite possibly replaced by a larger duration of 9 eighths.
As the first part of the piece unfolds, a recurring cycle of 6 and 9 becomes &ldquo;regular&rdquo; (in the sense that it becomes predictable), but both
of these spans ultimately give way to a more strongly confirmed series of 5s.
During this second part of the piece, as our counting accelerates, it also
becomes more evenly directed. More colloquially, we experience the irony of
counting spans more typically associated with periodicity (6 and 9) as less
stable and the subsequent 5s as a resolution of that tension. Coming unfixed
helps us to recognize these &ldquo;changes in time.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup></p>

identifies the changing rhythms in this piece as representative of the Romanian

upon meter as described by Christopher Hasty in <i>Meter as Rhythm</i> (New
York: Oxford University Press, 1997). Hasty describes meter as arising
processively, that is, by comparing one&rsquo;s expectations for beginnings (and
therefore accents) with how they actually occur. Any misrepresentations of his
terminology and symbols are of course my own. I also recognize that the reading
given below may not correspond with the reader&rsquo;s preferred one. The point is not to choose a single reading, but rather to focus on the
notion that readings <i>emerge</i> rather than come to us fully formed. <i>Any</i>
reading (not just the one given above) takes time to come about.<br><a href="#FN4REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN5">5.</a> Although Hasty does not describe processive meter as an act of counting, I
will frequently use this verb in my descriptions to draw attention to our
active, in-time engagement with meter. In other words, I do not intend
&ldquo;counting&rdquo; to represent an independently imposed or periodic schema.
Victor Zuckerkandl describes counting analogously (as a process); see for
example <i>Sound and Symbol Music and the External World</i>, trans. Willard

1 is a vertical slash followed by a diagonal one. This is Hasty&rsquo;s way of
indicating that the very beginning event (the first two quarter notes) becomes
an anacrusis, and therefore (eventually) does not create additional projections.<br><a href="#FN6REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN7">7.</a> Hasty describes possible &ldquo;early&rdquo; entries of beginning events in
his Example 7.3 (<i>Meter as Rhythm</i>, 87). The various cases shown there
are distinguished by how early a third event arrives. My description of G&rsquo;s
early arrival is most similar to Example 7.3d, where the third event comes so
early that the potential of the previous beginning comes into question. This
will be discussed below.<br><a href="#FN7REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN8">8.</a> Maury Yeston first described metrically defined strata as consonant or
dissonant with one another in <i>The Stratification of Musical Rhythm</i> (New

by Harald Krebs in &ldquo;Some Extensions of the Concepts of Metrical Consonance
and Dissonance,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 31.1 (Spring 1987): 99&ndash;120,

changing time signatures at rehearsals 47 to 49 in the first movement of the
First Piano Concerto might be rebarred entirely in 2/4. In his Example 10 Breuer

addition to being unmusical, the periodic version actually makes the orchestral
parts harder to read.<br><a href="#FN11REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN12">12.</a> This reading is similar to readings of Stravinsky&rsquo;s metrical irregularity
by Pieter van den Toorn. See, for example, his discussion of background
periodicity in chapter 3 of <i>Stravinsky and &ldquo;The Rite of Spring&rdquo;</i>
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987).<br><a href="#FN12REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN13">13.</a> See my analyses of portions of <i>Renard</i> and <i>Les Noces</i> in

are repeated, they may become contextually regular. That we may experience
repeated irregularities differently at different points of the piece is an idea
central to this paper.<br><a href="#FN14REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN15">15.</a> Full consonance, a term from Cohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metric and Hypermetric
Dissonance&rdquo; is the partitioning of a span where each level is exclusively
subdivided by either two or three, terminology that echoes the metrical
well-formedness
rules of Lerdahl and Jackendoff and highlights the typical metrical ease with
which such passages are associated. By distinguishing the &ldquo;normal
situation&rdquo; of full consonance, Cohn is able to describe situations outside
the norm, such as ongoing competing partitions of two and three at a single
level.<br><a href="#FN15REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN16">16.</a> One&rsquo;s perception of quarter-eighth has been heavily colored already in
this piece by the repetitions of bar 3, where a double neighbor figure around G
is also anacrustic.<br><a href="#FN16REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN17">17.</a> Hasty argues that a span of 5 cannot give rise to strong projections
precisely because neither 2 nor 3 is exclusively fundamental to its
identity; he describes the quality of 5 as &ldquo;limping.&rdquo; Instead he
focuses on the larger groupings within 5; he would label the 5 here as
&ldquo;duple unequal.&rdquo; See his discussion in <i>Meter as Rhythm</i>, pages
142&ndash;45.<br><a href="#FN17REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN18">18.</a> Alternatively, some counters might come to count by 10s as early as bar
20 (i.e., beginning hypermeasures a bar earlier than shown in Example 4, in what Lerdahl and Jackendoff would call an &ldquo;out-of-phase&rdquo;
manner). This reading considers bar 21 as a continuation of bar 20 based on the
precedent of bars 4 and 5. An expectation for continuation after bar 20 has been
shaped by appending to bar 4&rsquo;s cadential arrival an anacrustic gesture (the two
stepwise, ascending quarters that begin each phrase); this joining is reinforced
in each succeeding phrase. We might hear a similar continuation take place at
bar 21, for its E and F mimic the anacrusis from earlier in the piece. The larger point remains
unaffected, however: in <i>either</i> reading, counting
in part two becomes smoother sailing: both 5s and 10s continue easily and
without significant interruption until near the end of the piece.<br><a href="#FN18REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN19">19.</a> Hasty, <i>Meter as Rhythm</i>, describes a hiatus as &ldquo;a break
between the realization of projected potential and a new beginning&rdquo; (page
88); in other words, a hiatus takes place when projection is temporarily
interrupted.<br><a href="#FN19REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN20">20.</a> The animations in Examples 2, 4, and 6 were designed by Indiana University
music theory doctoral student Brent Yorgason. I wish to thank him for his
efforts.<br><a href="#FN20REF">Return to text</a></p><div id="fndiv1" class="flyoverdiv">The bracketed melodic and durational pattern shown in Example
1 repeats four more times, a fact that will be central as the analysis
continues.</div><div id="fndiv2" class="flyoverdiv">The terms radical and conservative come from Andrew Imbrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;&lsquo;Extra&rsquo;
Measures and Metrical Ambiguity in Beethoven,&rdquo; in Alan Tyson, ed., <i>Beethoven
Studies</i> (New York: Norton, 1973), 45&ndash;66. Imbrie suggests that in the face of
metrical irregularity, conservative listeners prefer to maintain an established
periodic counting as long as possible, whereas radical listeners prefer
immediately to adjust to a new counting.</div><div id="fndiv3" class="flyoverdiv">According to Benjamin Suchoff&rsquo;s <i>Guide to the &ldquo;Mikrokosmos&rdquo;</i>
(New York: Da Capo Press, 1983), Bart&oacute;k remarked that the changes of time in
#126 were similar to those found in Romanian folk music (page 109). Janos Breuer
identifies the changing rhythms in this piece as representative of the Romanian
kolinda (carol); see &ldquo;Kolinda Rhythm in the Music of Bart&oacute;k,&rdquo; <i>Studia
Musicologica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae</i> 17 (1975): 39&ndash;58.</div><div id="fndiv4" class="flyoverdiv">In its emphasis on moment-to-moment decision-making, this analysis draws
upon meter as described by Christopher Hasty in <i>Meter as Rhythm</i> (New
York: Oxford University Press, 1997). Hasty describes meter as arising
processively, that is, by comparing one&rsquo;s expectations for beginnings (and
therefore accents) with how they actually occur. Any misrepresentations of his
terminology and symbols are of course my own. I also recognize that the reading
given below may not correspond with the reader&rsquo;s preferred one. The point is not to choose a single reading, but rather to focus on the
notion that readings <i>emerge</i> rather than come to us fully formed. <i>Any</i>
reading (not just the one given above) takes time to come about.</div><div id="fndiv5" class="flyoverdiv">Although Hasty does not describe processive meter as an act of counting, I
will frequently use this verb in my descriptions to draw attention to our
active, in-time engagement with meter. In other words, I do not intend
&ldquo;counting&rdquo; to represent an independently imposed or periodic schema.
Victor Zuckerkandl describes counting analogously (as a process); see for
example <i>Sound and Symbol Music and the External World</i>, trans. Willard
Trask (New York: Pantheon Books, 1956), 167&ndash;68.</div><div id="fndiv6" class="flyoverdiv">Directly above the first measure of Example
1 is a vertical slash followed by a diagonal one. This is Hasty&rsquo;s way of
indicating that the very beginning event (the first two quarter notes) becomes
an anacrusis, and therefore (eventually) does not create additional projections.</div><div id="fndiv7" class="flyoverdiv">Hasty describes possible &ldquo;early&rdquo; entries of beginning events in
his Example 7.3 (<i>Meter as Rhythm</i>, 87). The various cases shown there
are distinguished by how early a third event arrives. My description of G&rsquo;s
early arrival is most similar to Example 7.3d, where the third event comes so
early that the potential of the previous beginning comes into question. This
will be discussed below.</div><div id="fndiv8" class="flyoverdiv">Maury Yeston first described metrically defined strata as consonant or
dissonant with one another in <i>The Stratification of Musical Rhythm</i> (New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1975). The model has been considerably amplified
by Harald Krebs in &ldquo;Some Extensions of the Concepts of Metrical Consonance
and Dissonance,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music Theory</i> 31.1 (Spring 1987): 99&ndash;120,
and more recently in <i>Fantasy Pieces: Metrical Dissonance in the Music of
Robert Schumann</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999).</div><div id="fndiv9" class="flyoverdiv">The metrical grid developed by Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff is perhaps
the clearest representation of fixed meter. Lerdahl and Jackendoff define meter as strictly
periodic at the levels of tactus and measure, permitting metrical
reinterpretation (their term is metrical deletion) only at hypermetrical levels
and in conjunction with grouping elision. See <i>A Generative Theory of Tonal
Music</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1983), especially pages 99&ndash;104.</div><div id="fndiv10" class="flyoverdiv">Yeston, <i>Stratification</i>, first formalized hemiolas above the level
of the notated measure. Cohn has developed more sophisticated models. See
especially his &ldquo;Metric and Hypermetric Dissonance in the Menuetto of
Mozart&rsquo;s Symphony in G Minor, K. 550,&rdquo; <i>Int&eacute;gral</i> 6 (1992):
1&ndash;33.</div><div id="fndiv11" class="flyoverdiv">Breuer, &ldquo;Kolinda Rhythm in the Music of Bart&oacute;k,&rdquo; discusses the
practice of rebarring difficult passages periodically as a performance aid,
citing Bart&oacute;k&rsquo;s suggestion to the conductor Hugo Balzer in 1930 that the
changing time signatures at rehearsals 47 to 49 in the first movement of the
First Piano Concerto might be rebarred entirely in 2/4. In his Example 10 Breuer
aligns the original notation with a 2/4 rebarring, and concludes that in
addition to being unmusical, the periodic version actually makes the orchestral
parts harder to read.</div><div id="fndiv12" class="flyoverdiv">This reading is similar to readings of Stravinsky&rsquo;s metrical irregularity
by Pieter van den Toorn. See, for example, his discussion of background
periodicity in chapter 3 of <i>Stravinsky and &ldquo;The Rite of Spring&rdquo;</i>
