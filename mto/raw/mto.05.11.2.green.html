<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] How fortunate we are to have within a few short years three 
outstanding book-length studies of seventeenth-century musical thought in 
England. Penelope Gouk&rsquo;s <i>Music, Science and Natural Magic in Seventeenth-Century 
England</i> (<a href="#gouk_1999" id="citation_gouk_1999_67dc9b46d6885">1999</a>) and Jamie Kassler&rsquo;s <i>The Beginnings of the Modern Philosophy of 
Music in England</i> (<a href="#kassler_2004" id="citation_kassler_2004_67dc9b46d688c">2004</a>) greatly enrich our understanding of the influence of the 
British empiricist movement on speculative theory, while Rebecca Herissone&rsquo;s <i>Music Theory in Seventeenth-Century England</i> (2000) draws our attention to the 
practical aspects of theoretical writings as they reflect contemporary practice. Herissone&rsquo;s study is particularly welcome because of the depth and breadth of 
her research on many matters that have previously been approached in piecemeal 
fashion or limited to the ideas of a few major figures, such as Morley, Campion, 
Butler, Purcell, and North.</p>
<p>[2] As is often the case with book titles, Herissone&rsquo;s title is too succinct to 
give a proper feel of the inquiry that follows; it understates the time span of 
the study and overstates its scope. Opening with the word &ldquo;practical&rdquo; might have 
helped&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure the author considered this&mdash;but that qualification of theory 
would probably trouble some present-day readers much as it seemingly did Samuel Pepys, when in 1668 he undertook to read 
&ldquo;music theory.&rdquo; As Hollander points out 
(<a href="#hollander_1970" id="citation_hollander_1970_67dc9b46d6890">1970</a>, 387), the works Pepys sought out were philosophically oriented treatises 
by Mersenne (l637) and Descartes (l618). Needless to say, the precise nature of 
Herissone&rsquo;s study is amply described in her preface.</p>
<p>[3] In the preface, Herissone carefully details the scope of the study and the 
importance of its contribution relative to research conducted in the past half 
century. Her objective is to document and interpret certain practical ways of 
thinking that evolved between the 1590s and 1720s in an inclusive set of 
writings ranging from Thomas Morley&rsquo;s <i>A Plaine and Easie Introduction to 
Practicall Musicke</i> to the manuscript essays of Roger North. The late 
sixteenth-century treatises of Morley (1597) and Bathe (c.1592) serve to 
benchmark the Renaissance constructs that were in vogue at the start of a 
radical transformation of theory and practice. The early eighteenth-century 
writings of North (c.1700&ndash;1728) and Malcom (1721) are needed &ldquo;to encompass early 
writings&rdquo; (vii). As we see in the chapter on Sources, Herissone&rsquo;s inclusive set 
of writings comprises approximately 100 treatises&mdash;notably a dozen scholarly 
treatises with practical content, 27 &ldquo;rudiments manuals&rdquo; designed for the 
amateur, 42 instrumental tutors, and sundry vocal tutors, thorough-bass manuals, 
and miscellaneous items such as prefaces and instructions inserted in 
collections. Fludd&rsquo;s mystical works and the output of scientists following in 
Francis Bacon&rsquo;s footsteps are given short shrift, but three English translations 
of foreign works&mdash;Dowland&rsquo;s 1609 translation of the <i>Micrologus</i> of Ornithoparchus 
(1517), Brouncker&rsquo;s 1653 translation of Descartes&rsquo; <i>Compendium</i> (1618), and Birchensha&rsquo;s 1664 translation of Alstedt&rsquo;s
<i>Templum musicum</i> (1610)&mdash;are included 
to amplify native ideas.</p>
<p>[4] All in all, this is an enormous amount of source material to organize and 
digest, but by limiting the scope of the inquiry and by organizing the 
presentation so that some of the burden is shifted to appendices, Herissone 
achieves a considerable success. Through a close reading of these largely 
pedagogical sources by approximately 70 writers, she is able to establish, one 
by one, an impressive chronology of concepts about rhythm, pitch, and form, and 
of changes in terminology and notation practice that obtained during this 
puzzling era of style change. She can confidently identify &ldquo;first mentions&rdquo; of 
various developments and also note the absence of reference to ideas needed to 
explain features of contemporary practice. </p>
<p>[5] One should note, however, that Herissone&rsquo;s strategy of containment does 
require a fair amount of expertise from her readership. To maintain control of 
the intricate zigzagging developments of the period, she narrows the range of 
topics by eliminating from consideration the speculative aspects of theory that 
are the main focus of some of the major treatises. Thus she gives short shrift 
to topics such as temperament, theories of consonance and dissonance, musical 
acoustics, and the affective properties of music&mdash;topics that are not entirely 
speculative and do impinge on practical theory. Moreover, at the close of the 
preface we find this rather startling statement:</p>

<blockquote>With the exception of one or two particularly pertinent references, I have not 
addressed the difficult and tremendously important issue of the relationship 
between musical theory and contemporary practice. This avoidance derives partly 
from lack of space, as ever, but principally due to the fact that I aim to 
produce a companion book to this volume, one which will also derive from my 
thesis, in which this complex area is assessed through analysis of the major 
seventeenth-century sources (ix).
</blockquote>
<p>The reader of the book in hand must either possess a considerable familiarity 
with the repertoire and practices of the day or must accept the assumption that 
statements and examples provided in manuals intended as how-to-do-it books for 
non-professionals do indeed reflect actual practice. One should also note that 
Herissone&rsquo;s careful attention to chronology is compromised by a surprising lack 
of reference to the tumultuous political and social events of 
seventeenth-century England and especially to the changes brought about by the 
Restoration in 1660. Here again the reader is expected to bring a specialized 
sort of knowledge to the enterprise. In sum, Herissone&rsquo;s choices regarding 
temporal boundaries, the inclusion of rudimentary sources, the limitation of 
topics, etc., while seemly, appropriate and judicious, inevitably raise issues 
that some could find annoying.</p>
<p>[6] Such considerations aside, one must applaud the effective manner of 
presenting and analyzing the data. Herissone surveys the sources first and then 
explores the discussions of constructs according to a logical set of topic 
areas. In this way she enables the reader to get a sense of the individual 
writers and their texts before shifting attention to the issues of time, pitch 
structure, harmony, compositional rules, tonality, texture, and form. The last 
20% of the book is given over to four appendices that provide the reader with 
additional information about individual treatises and their interrelationships. 
Appendix A is an alphabetical list of treatises with bibliographic annotations; 
B is a chronological list of treatises and editions; C surveys each edition and 
reprinting of Playford&rsquo;s <i>Introduction to the Skill of Music</i> with detailed 
commentary on changes and additions; and D surveys the sources, duplications, 
borrowings and plagiarism of theoretical ideas in 65 treatises and tutors. The 
generous allotment of plates, figures, tables, and musical examples from the 
treatises effectively enhances the highly technical presentation. Figure 1.1, a 
diagram of the complex web of textual relationships among certain instrumental 
tutors, is a particularly meritorious example. </p>
<p>[7] A synopsis of the topical chapters may usefully show the range of ideas 
covered. <i>Time</i> begins by detailing the shift from mensural notation to a 
context-independent notation suitable for score form. Additional topics include 
meter and metrical accent, proportion, changing concept of tactus and 
time-beating, notation of meter and rhythm, mensuration and proportion 
signatures, time signatures, and the bar line. <i>Pitch Structure</i> reviews the 
decline of the hexachordal system, alterations to gamut diagrams and to the 
solmization procedure, the development of major and minor scales, the notation 
of accidentals, chromaticism, the natural sign, and the clefs. <i>Harmony</i> discusses 
the intervals [dyads] of two-part writing and the theory of triadic inversion. 
<i>Compositional Rules</i> reviews the writing of note-against-note and florid 
counterpoint, the treatment of concords and discords, and the cadences. <i>Tonality</i> 
discusses the issues of modal theory, the development of harmonic tonality, 
modulation, transposition, related keys, and key signatures. <i>Texture and Form</i> 
provides instruction regarding imitative and other textures, and discusses the 
forms and structural principles of movements and large-scale formal schemes.</p>
<p>[8] Throughout the book, Herissone supplements the discussion with quotations 
from the original texts, thereby giving the reader a sense of how these authors 
expressed&mdash;perhaps grappled with&mdash;difficult ideas.</p>
<p>[9] Overall, the quality of interpretation and argument is uniformly very fine, 
although I must admit that the author&rsquo;s policy of depending only on musical 
illustrations taken from the primary sources made the going a bit tedious in the 
discussion of &ldquo;Succession of Concords&rdquo; (146&ndash;54). Some illustrations of the 
various part-writing moves would have been helpful. Overall, however, the 
writing is clear and accessible.</p>
<p>[10] Through the use of extensive and often voluminous footnoting, Herissone 
manages to impart an impressive amount of information, not only for the purpose 
of documenting primary and secondary sources, and cross-referencing, but also 
for recommending further reading. Occasionally, when issues arise that could 
stand explaining in greater detail, she attempts to assuage the curmudgeon&rsquo;s 
pique by footnoting extensive sets of references. It is, of course the author&rsquo;s 
right to judge what can and should be relegated to footnotes. As a troublesome 
example, however, consider her treatment of a discussion by Daniel Robinson 
dating from 1715. She remarks:</p>
<blockquote>He singled out the voice and violin because neither is a fixed pitch instrument, 
so they are not subject to the restrictions imposed by temperament. In England 
at this time, although equal temperament was usually used for fretted 
instruments, keyboards were still predominantly tuned using meantone temperament 
which rendered keys with more than about three flats or sharps unusable (190).
</blockquote>
<p>While this statement may well be true, it deserves a specific citation and 
clarification of the type of meantone temperament intended. (Are we to assume 
the English were still using the old 1/4-comma tuning?) Instead of this, the 
appended footnote (n.88) lists seven general references regarding tuning and 
temperament, and in effect, dismisses the need to consider the importance of 
temperament in the move toward the 24-key, closed circle of fifths conception of 
harmonic tonality that became the norm in the early eighteenth century.</p>
<p>[11] Readers will greatly appreciate Herrisone&rsquo;s concluding chapter, because in 
it she neatly summarizes and organizes into a unified narrative the massive 
amount of data that has been presented in the body of the work. There is no need 
here to relive the Locke-Salmon controversy about systems of clefs or to review 
the idiosyncrasies of the large cast of characters that has been paraded before 
us. What is needed is precisely what appears: a chapter-by-chapter distillation 
of main ideas and developments.</p>
<p>[12] Somewhat surprisingly, Herissone puts the big finish&mdash;what I would call the 
&ldquo;Hollywood Ending&rdquo;&mdash;at the beginning of the chapter:</p>
<blockquote>Music theory underwent an enormous transformation in the seventeenth century, a 
change which&mdash;through its rejection of traditional ideas going back in some cases 
to medieval times&mdash;saw theory being brought closer to musical practice than it 
had been for some considerable time. English theorists were at the forefront of 
the modernization process for two important reasons: first, there was no strong 
tradition of theoretical writing from the sixteenth century in England, which 
meant that seventeenth-century writers had few models on which to base their 
ideas; second, the great majority of English theory books were practical 
instruction books, aimed at the musical amateur. Whereas in Continental theory 
great emphasis was placed on speculative issues, such as the origins of music, 
English writers concentrated instead on concise, clear teaching of rules an 
amateur musician would need to understand in order to be able to play or write 
music (224).
</blockquote>
<p>Here, we find the return of a theme that figures prominently in the book&mdash;that 
the practical-minded English writers found it easier to cast off old ways (for 
example, modal thinking in favor of the key system) because they either rejected 
or were largely unaware of Continental developments. The notion of an English 
isolation creating a separate path to the key-based, harmonic style of 
eighteenth-century tonality has been noted by other scholars, as well. Harold 
Powers speaks of an &ldquo;English innocence of Continental modal theory&rdquo; (<a href="#powers_1998" id="citation_powers_1998_67dc9b46d68e2">1998</a>, 334 
n.2) and alludes to &ldquo;the separate route from psalmody to tonality&rdquo; taken by 
English theory (<a href="#powers_1998" id="citation_powers_1998_67dc9b46d68e6">1998</a>, 275). Joel Lester speculates that the separate path had a 
religious origin:</p>
<blockquote>
English theorists in general had never gotten involved in the intricacies of 
Continental modal theory, and the political and religious upheavals in England 
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries certainly did not encourage 
scholarship into the modes associated with Catholic music. As a result, English 
theorists did not have to overcome entrenched habits of modal thinking, as did 
their Continental counterparts (<a href="#lester_1989" id="citation_lester_1989_67dc9b46d68e9">1989</a>, 101).
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Jessie Ann Owens, observing the &ldquo;significant difference&rdquo; of English 
theory
(<a href="#owens_1998" id="citation_owens_1998_67dc9b46d68ed">1998</a>, 230), and Gregory Barnett, reflecting on the &ldquo;wholly different case&rdquo; in 
English musical thought (<a href="#barnett_2002" id="citation_barnett_2002_67dc9b46d68f0">2002</a>, 435&ndash;6), suggest that religious issues were a 
cause of the separation. So there you have it. These writers see theological 
differences at bottom; Herissone prefers to stress English empiricism and 
practicality. Thanks to her keen insight and hard work, this highly sympathetic 
and favorable account of English practical theory will serve us well in our 
quest &ldquo;to put each writer&rsquo;s ideas into context properly&rdquo; (viii).</p>
