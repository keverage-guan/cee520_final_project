<h3><a name="Section1">1. Naturalizing Music Theory: What It Is, What It Isn&rsquo;t</a></h3>

<p>[1.1] There seems to be a confusion about Brown&rsquo;s suggestion to
<i>naturalize</i> music theory. In response to Brown, Walker objected that
&ldquo;Neurath was able to keep his boat afloat only because, as a logical
positivist, he still believed that analytical [<i>sic</i>] and synthetic
propositions were logically distinct [from each other], and
accordingly upheld the dichotomies of theory/observation and
form/content. Quine&rsquo;s project of a naturalized epistemology arises
precisely from his denial that any such logical distinctions can be
made. Because of this denial, Quine can never keep Brown, Neurath or
anyone else afloat.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p>

[1.2] Walker&rsquo;s criticism of Brown is unfounded and stems from Walker&rsquo;s
misreading of Quine. Brown does not equate <i>naturalizing</i> music theory
with putting observational (synthetic) and foundational (analytic)
statements on the same footing.  Rather, Brown makes the point, taken
from Quine&rsquo;s view of science, that observational statements differ
from foundational ones in degree but not in kind. Consider this
example: &ldquo;The distribution of interval-class invariant pc-set classes
contributes to organic coherence in Webern&rsquo;s music.&rdquo; In one context,
this statement would be considered observational, in another context
it would be foundational.  In other words: in one case the analyst
might try to analyze and explicate Webern&rsquo;s pitch organization
(observational), while in another case, assumptions concerning
Webern&rsquo;s pitch organization may enter into the analysis of some other
aspect of his music&mdash;or perhaps another composer&rsquo;s music
(foundational).<p>

[1.3] Quine&rsquo;s central contention is that &ldquo;all statements are revisable&rdquo;:
there is no <i>strict</i> dichotomy between observational statements
(synthetic/revisable) and foundational statements
(analytic/non-revisable). Whether a statement is observational or
foundational is not a philosophical question. It&rsquo;s an empirical
question.  It&rsquo;s a question about how humans reason.  Therefore, it&rsquo;s a
question for behavioral psychology, which is a natural science&mdash;hence the term <i>naturalized</i>.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup><p>

[1.4] When there&rsquo;s friction between observations and foundational
principles, it may be a good idea to revise foundational
principles. When faced with such friction, we can amend a theory, or
theories, in various places to accommodate it.  Of course, our
tendency is to disturb the entire system of theories as little as
possible (call it laziness).  So, we focus our revisions upon the
specific observational statements which aroused the friction.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup>. In
this sense, revisability is like a continuous field.  At least, for
science, the perimeter of this field is comprised of simple
observations such as &ldquo;That leaf is green.&rdquo; At the center are axioms of
mathematics and logic, such as the <i>law of excluded middle</i> and <i>modus
ponens</i>, etc.  Revising statements at the center of the field is like
rebuilding the entire foundation of the Empire State Building (not a
task for theorists with a busy teaching schedule).  Such a task
requires evacuating the whole building and rebuilding it from scratch
(not to mention redecorating): revising all analytical strategies (not
to mention all actual analyses). Nevertheless&mdash;and this the thrust
of the <i>naturalized</i> viewpoint&mdash;the logical distinction between
making minor repairs and rebuilding foundations is only one of degree:
the foundation is part of the building itself. What <i>naturalizing</i>
music theory suggests, is that no statement or theory is immune to
revision; however, it does <i>not</i> suggest that all statements and
theories are equally susceptible to revision.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> That&rsquo;s where Walker
is mistaken.<p>


<h3><a NAME="Section2">2. What Revisions?</a></h3>

<p>[2.1] What to revise, and what not to revise&mdash;that&rsquo;s the question.
The answer depends somewhat on what the aims of music theory are.  But
putting that issue aside for the moment, what other issues are
involved? Inevitably, we look at which theories incorporate more
details of the music (e.g. pc-set theory), and which theories afford
more satisfying analyses (e.g. Schenkerian).<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> Still further, we hope
that a theory which affords detailed and satisfying analyses of one
class of music (e.g. tonal) will apply somehow to other classes of
music (e.g atonal, twelve-tone, serial etc.)<p>

[2.2] Don&rsquo;t think music theory is alone with these dilemmas: detailed,
is analogous to what statisticians call <i>validity</i>; satisfying, is
analogous to what they call <i>sensitivity</i>.  Validity is, roughly, the
proportion of data values included in a statistical procedure
(detailed).  Sensitivity is the interpretive precision allowed by the
included data values (satisfying). Increasing validity decreases
sensitivity, and vice-versa.  A statistical procedure is called
<i>robust</i> if it retains validity <i>and</i> sensitivity when applied to data
sets which differ from the expected profile (e.g. classes of music to
which we didn&rsquo;t expect to apply the analytic procedure).<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup><p>

<h3><a NAME="Section3">3. What is Our Aim?</a></h3>

<p>[3.1] Now, the degree of robustness we want in analytical strategies,
and also the criteria for what we consider satisfying (sensitive),
depend on our expectations of music theory and analysis: what is our
aim? Is it scientific or is it aesthetic?  Brown, and his colleague
Douglas Dempster, tell us that our goals should be scientific.  On the
one hand, they tell us that there&rsquo;s already a precedent for scientific
goals in music theory.  On the other hand, they tell us that modifying
music theory, to make it truly scientific, isn&rsquo;t such bitter medicine
after all.<p>

<h3><a NAME="Section4">4. Precedents</a></h3>

<p>[4.1] As for precedents, Brown and Dempster cite Boretz, Rahn, and
Babbitt. In &ldquo;The Scientific Image of Music Theory&rdquo; Brown and Dempster
somehow labeled Boretz, Rahn, and Babbitt scientific music theorists
because Boretz, Rahn, and Babbitt espouse a scientific language for
analytical and theoretical discourse.  Brown and Dempster then assumed
that these three theorists espouse such language <i>because</i> they
adopted the goals of science.  Brown and Dempster then claimed that
Boretz, Rahn, and Babbitt aren&rsquo;t really doing what they set out to do,
because they cannot support predictive models, which constitute
science.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> But Brown and Dempster failed to show that these three
theorists adopted empirical scientific goals in the first place.  And
in fact Boretz, Rahn, and Babbitt <i>never</i> ascribed to the predictive
aims of empirical scientists, regardless of whether they emphasize
uniqueness of a musical work over similarity to other
&ldquo;masterworks.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> It is more likely that Boretz, Rahn, and
Babbitt espouse a scientific language of discourse because they
recognize that less precise language is inadequate for conveying the
critical points they want to make, to do full justice to the music
they are critiquing. Brown and Dempster confused choice of language of
discourse with choice of goals.  So much for precedents.<p>

<h3><a NAME="Section5">5. Brown&rsquo;s (and Dempster&rsquo;s) Medicine</a></h3>

<p>[5.1] Now let&rsquo;s look at the medicine Brown is prescribing. It seems that
Brown&rsquo;s intent in &ldquo;Adrift on Neurath&rsquo;s Boat&rdquo; is to beef up the
credibility of music theory in the wake of criticisms from the New
Musicology corner.  In his final remarks he makes proposals for
improving the discipline of music theory in light of a naturalized
model (allowing revisions). Brown proposes that &ldquo;we must tighten up
the ways in which we test theories and analyses,&rdquo; and emphasizes &ldquo;the
need to find law-like relationships not only among aesthetic
properties, but also between aesthetic and nonaesthetic
properties.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> Can music theory live happily with these
modifications?<p>

[5.2] What about testing theories and analyses? I presume that testing
theories and analyses means taking aim at dubious claims about a
particular musical work or a particular dimension (e.g.  the role of
pc-set structures) of a body of musical works (e.g.  music in the
twelve-pitched equal tempered system).<p>

[5.3] In an analysis, we inevitably highlight selected nonaesthetic
properties which we claim have aesthetic <i>significance</i> in the global
interpretation of the work. Let&rsquo;s assume our theories and analyses are
logically consistent and not counterfactual. We may then question the
claims by asking how, why, and how much are <i>these</i> nonaesthetic
properties significant?<p>

[5.4] We might deem a nonaesthetic property significant because it is a
contextual anomaly with respect to analogous contexts in other musical
works or in the same work. We can debunk such a claim of aesthetic
significance by demonstrating that, in fact, the nonaesthetic property
in question is a consequence of the musical system or the
compositional technique.  Babbitt demonstrates how nonaesthetic
properties of a musical work which seem to be anomalous, can actually
be consequences of the twelve-tone system. In one instance, he
discusses the significance of Stravinsky&rsquo;s choice of the 6-9 hexachord
in his &ldquo;Variations.&rdquo;  Babbitt demonstrates that the inversional
relationship between the &ldquo;verticals&rdquo; resulting from order rotations is
<i>not</i> due to properties peculiar to the 6-9 hexachord.  Rather it is a consequence of the order rotation procedure.<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> Once we know that
Stravinsky was using that rotation procedure, it becomes evident that
Stravinsky&rsquo;s choice of the 6-9 hexachord isn&rsquo;t so significant after
all. Babbitt emphasizes the importance of formal music theory
techniques in separating &ldquo;particularity&rdquo; from &ldquo;generality&rdquo; and
therefore significance from irrelevance.<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> We determine such
significance by deduction from axioms. Therefore, Brown&rsquo;s empirical
testing doesn&rsquo;t apply to debunking such a claim of aesthetic
significance (a claim that the nonaesthetic property is a contextual
anomaly: unlikely to occur by accident).<p>

[5.5] We may also deem a nonaesthetic property aesthetically
significant because it is easily heard.  Suppose the property in
question is a similarity between two particular sonorities in the
musical work.  We note that the two sonorities contain the same
interval classes. Brown would have us refer to psychoacoustic test
results to decide how easy it is to hear that two sonorities contain
the same interval classes. However, such psychoacoustic experiments
inevitably use out-of-context listening examples.  It&rsquo;s not hard to
imagine that, in an <i>actual</i> musical context, the interval content of
set-classes is reinforced if it occurs first as a melody and then
as a harmony, or vice-versa.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> Psychoacoustics cannot account for
such specific contextual factors.  We will always have to weigh on a
case by case basis out-of-context empirical results against contextual
factors in order to gauge the audibility of a nonaesthetic property.
Therefore, we can&rsquo;t develop across-the-board standards to test how
easily a nonaesthetic property is heard, to decide on aesthetic
significance. We can&rsquo;t scientifically test theories and analyses,
unless they cease to employ (implicitly or explicitly) aesthetic
concepts of significance. So much for scientifically testing theories
and analyses.<p>

[5.6] Brown&rsquo;s medicine seems innocuous (even tasteless) at first glance
because it purports to help us understand aesthetic properties
better. (That sounds OK. It&rsquo;s already part of the agenda of music
theory, so maybe Brown and Dempster&rsquo;s scientific model is compatible
with the aesthetic aims of music theory.) In fact, understanding
aesthetic concepts is one of his main ingredients: Brown emphasizes
&ldquo;the need to find law-like relationships not only among aesthetic
properties, but also between aesthetic and nonaesthetic properties.&rdquo;<p>

[5.7] Finding law-like relationships between aesthetic and nonaesthetic
properties is an enterprise which might seem sensible at first
glance. But it&rsquo;s not. Frank Sibley explained the problem, in a general
way in his essay &ldquo;Aesthetic Concepts.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> Now let&rsquo;s apply it to the
case of music theory.<p>

[5.8] Generally, we may say that the presence of a nonaesthetic
property can be determined by some mechanical procedure, whether
simple (e.g. observing the notes in a chord) or involved (e.g.
invariance matrices and pc-similarity measures). On the other hand,
the application of an aesthetic term is anything but mechanical.
Sibley explains &ldquo;the making of such judgments as these requires the
exercise of taste, perceptiveness, or sensitivity, of aesthetic
discrimination or appreciation. One would not say this of the first
group, [nonaesthetic terms].&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Aesthetic terms enter when we
interpret the role of particular nonaesthetic properties in a given
musical context. (e.g. how pitch-relationships [nonaesthetic]
contribute to organic coherence [aesthetic]).<p>

[5.9] In order to find law-like relationships between aesthetic and
nonaesthetic properties, we must assume that the mere presence of
certain nonaesthetic properties in a musical work can determine
whether or not a certain aesthetic term is appropriate for that work,
dimension of the work, or section of the work. We&rsquo;re looking for laws
of appropriateness for saying that a musical work has such-and-such an
aesthetic property?<p>

[5.10] Often we support the application of an aesthetic term by
referring to other aesthetic properties which we claim are present in
the musical work.  However, in other instances we support the
application of an aesthetic term by referring to purely nonaesthetic
properties which are present.  We may eagerly jump to the conclusion
(as Brown does) that the dependence of aesthetic properties on
nonaesthetic properties can be formulated into rules or laws.  Not
so. &ldquo;[T]here are no nonaesthetic features which service in <i>any</i>
circumstances as logically <i>sufficient conditions</i> for applying
aesthetic terms.  Aesthetic or taste concepts are not in <i>this</i>
respect condition-governed at all.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup><p>

[5.11] Many readers will know that Wittgenstein, among others,
illustrated that familiar everyday concepts are governed only loosely
by conditions, not strictly by necessary-and-sufficient
conditions.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> Some may therefore think it&rsquo;s plausible that aesthetic
concepts are, like familiar everyday concepts, governed in a loose way
by conditions.  However, this is not the case: the use of aesthetic
concepts differs radically from that of everyday concepts.<p>

[5.12] When there are no <i>necessary-and-sufficient</i> conditions for
applying an everyday concept, there are usually relevant features
which, if present, warrant the use the concept.  For example, in
claiming that someone is <i>intelligent</i> we can start to list features
which are relevant to <i>intelligence</i>.  Such relevant features are
&ldquo;ability to grasp and follow various kinds of instructions, ability to
master facts and marshal evidence, ability to solve mathematical or
chess problems,&rdquo; etc.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup> The presence of these features can only
support the claim, not count against it.  Although no one feature can
clinch the matter entirely, it is always possible to look at previous
cases to decide what group of features were sufficient to warrant the
use of the term <i>intelligent</i> in previous cases.<p>

[5.13] We can even accept that with everyday terms, such as
<i>intelligence</i>, the mere reporting of the presence of some group of
features will unquestioningly justify the use of the term.  &ldquo;We are
able to say &lsquo;If it is true he can do this, and that, and the other,
then one just cannot deny that he is intelligent.&rsquo;&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> However, for
aesthetic terms, this just won&rsquo;t do. The mere reporting of the
presence of some nonaesthetic features of a musical work can never
unquestioningly justify the application of some aesthetic term, such
as <i>organic coherence</i>.  We would not expect a music theorist or
analyst to say something such as &ldquo;If it is true that the successive
chords of piece have such-and-such an interval class invariance scheme
and the rhythm is generated by such and such a pattern,&rdquo; <i>et cetera ad
infinitum</i>, &ldquo;then one just cannot deny that the work is organically
coherent.&rdquo;  No theorist, analyst, or knowledgeable reader would
unqualifiedly accept a particular claim of <i>organic coherence</i> without
having heard the musical work in question, or having access to the
entire score.  To be even more crude, we would not expect a deaf (from
birth) person to discriminate aesthetic properties in a musical work,
no matter how well he has learned to identify and relate nonaesthetic
musical properties from scores, no matter how familiar he is with
precedents, no matter if he is a brilliant cognitive psychologist or
neurobiologist.  In short, aesthetic concepts differ from everyday
concepts in that their proper use depends on first hand experience,
not just testimony. We expect the reader of an analysis to follow the
score and/or listen to a recording of the work. Evidently, Brown
doesn&rsquo;t have such expectations.<p>

[5.14] Brown is asking us to seek law-like relationships between
aesthetic properties and nonaesthetic properties&mdash;prediction is his
game.  So he must be asking us to assume that the mere presence of
certain <i>nonaesthetic</i> properties in a musical work can determine the
aptness of applying a certain <i>aesthetic</i> term to the work, dimension
of the work, or section of the work.  Beware&mdash;the consumption of
this assumption might cause indigestion.<p>

[5.15] Allow me to introduce SMT (scientific music theorist).  Suppose
SMT gathers together paradigm cases of musical works, or excerpts,
which are said to have a particular aesthetic property.  Then, using
these paradigm musical examples as stimuli, SMT carries out
psycho-acoustic, neurobiological, and cognitive psychological
experiments (using musicians and nonmusicians as subjects).  Then SMT
analyzes the data; he correlates the responses of the study subjects
with nonaesthetic properties found in our paradigm musical examples.
Through this process SMT develops a predictive model, one that
provides laws describing the dependence of a particular aesthetic
property on the presence of particular nonaesthetic properties.  He
can then, as an analyst, apply such models, analyzing other musical
works, ascribing aesthetic properties to these musical works based on
an assemblage of information regarding nonaesthetic properties they
exhibit.<p>

[5.16] It is now time for SMT to become SMA (scientific music analyst)
in order to demonstrate the application of his research.  Now, imagine
behind a curtain is a musical work.  In front of the curtain is
SMA. SMA stands before an audience of other music analysts, theorists,
performers, and educated music enthusiasts.  SMA knows his audience
well; he knows they have a predilection for musical works deemed
<i>organically coherent</i>.  SMA is prepared to present an analysis of the
musical work to his audience, to convince them that the work is indeed
organically coherent.  He also knows that organic coherence is not
just a matter of nonaesthetic properties, but a matter of aesthetic
ones as well.  SMA has never actually heard the musical work behind
the curtain, nor seen the score; his audience is equally unfamiliar
with the musical work.  But SMA fears not: he is equipped with laws,
derived from empirical experiments, predicting the dependence of
aesthetic properties on nonaesthetic properties. His audience is
equally knowledgeable of these empirically tested laws (they do their
homework).  SMA has chosen his musical specimen by the following
process: He has a host of musical scores, with accompanying audio
recordings, encoded in all detail and stored in a database.  SMA has
developed a complex querying program which probes the musical works in
the database to find works which have the requisite combination of
nonaesthetic properties to have certain aesthetic properties, which
are in turn required in order to make his analysis convincing.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup> SMA
then delivers his analysis to his audience, citing the aesthetic
properties exhibited by the work.  Here and there he also cites some
nonaesthetic properties, in order to make his analysis more concrete.
The crowd follows the analysis point for point.  In the end they&rsquo;re
absolutely convinced that the musical work behind the curtain is
indeed <i>organically coherent</i>.  They all go home with a heightened
understanding and appreciation of the musical work, without having
heard it, without having seen the score.<p>

[5.17] The absurdity of this music-behind-the-curtain scenario points to
the problem with devising laws defining the relationships between
nonaesthetic properties and aesthetic properties: to devise such laws
is simply to turn the aesthetic terms into nonaesthetic terms.
Furthermore, the notion that music analyses can proceed and be
understood without first hand experience of the particular musical
work, serves as a kind of unintentional Ursatz of Brown and Dempster&rsquo;s
program. In &ldquo;The Scientific Image of Music Theory&rdquo; Brown and Dempster
rhetorically asked the questions &ldquo;[H]ow are analytical prescriptions
justified?  Should a naive listener simply place faith in the
authority of some particular analyst? If so, which one?,&rdquo; and &ldquo;[H]ow
can we be sure that the judgments of one self-professed connoisseur
are more trustworthy than those of another?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> That Brown and
Dempster even asked these questions suggests that they haven&rsquo;t
properly considered that an analysis is meant to be corroborated by
the reader.  Naive listeners can only benefit from a so-called
prescriptive analysis in so far as they can corroborate the claims
made in the analysis by inspecting the score and listening to the
piece.  They do not benefit by blindly swallowing claims made by the
analyst.  Therefore trust and faith are a nonissue, contrary to what
Brown and Dempster suggest. A music analysis must in some way
(implicitly or explicitly) involve aesthetic concepts. Otherwise, it
could be carried out, and be read and understood without first hand
experience of the specific musical work; such an analysis, is <i>no
aesthetic analysis at all</i>.  In fact it is a nonaesthetic analysis,
and it proceeds from the assumption that the music analyst, and the
reader of the analysis, are to maintain a somehow neutral <i>and remote</i>
relationship to the musical specimen being analyzed.  Such an
assumption suggests that the relationship between people and music is
analogous to the relationship between people and neutrino particles.
I guess Brown and Dempster do indeed propose a truly scientific model
of music theory&mdash;one that leads to the music-behind-the-curtain
scenario, one in which music theory adopts the aims of empirical
science.<p>

<h3><a NAME="Section6">6. Aesthetic Model or Scientific Model</a></h3>

<p>[6.1] Brown and Dempster don&rsquo;t see the conflict between their
scientific aims and our aesthetic aims. But in fact, there are three
fundamental differences between scientific knowledge/inquiry and music
theory/analysis.  They can be spelled out as follows: First: Science
serves as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the
light of past experience.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Music theory primarily develops tools
for doing critical analysis, ultimately for &ldquo;communicating critical
experiences&rdquo; in order to help others &ldquo;hear the piece better.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>Second: What scientists study can be considered static in light of the
following distinction: the behavior of the physical world is not
intrinsically or fundamentally changed by the creativity of human
beings, whereas music <i>is created</i> by human beings and, therefore,
what constitutes music is being redefined every day by people who make
it.<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> Third: Value judgments (those depending on subjective and
intersubjective taste or preference) are not intrinsically important
in science, whereas subjective and intersubjective taste are
intrinsically a part of music theory and analysis (at some level or
other) no matter how many objective facts and scientific techniques
the theorist employs.<p>

[6.2] As the smoke clears, it looks like Brown and Dempster thought,
that by asking us to be more scientific, they were asking us to grow
stronger roots for the tree that Boretz, Rahn, and Babbitt have
already grown (music theory as a science). But in fact, Brown and
Dempster are asking us to grow a whole new tree, with completely
different roots (predictive aims of empirical science)&mdash;roots which
neither Boretz, Rahn, Babbitt, nor the rest of music theory ever had.<p>

[6.3] Brown and Dempster direct deserved attention to the notion that
empirical science could be extremely fruitful for music theory:
psycho-acoustics, cognitive psychology, and neurobiology can be
<i>invaluable</i> for helping us understand how we hear, remember, and
physically respond to music. But that says nothing about choosing
empirical scientific <i>aims</i> (prediction) instead of critical aesthetic
<i>aims</i>. Contrary to what Brown and Dempster assumed, <i>there is no
inconsistency in enlisting the study of psycho-acoustics, cognitive
psychology, and neurobiology to pursue critical aesthetic aims.  There
is no inconsistency in choosing a precise language of discourse to
pursue critical aesthetic aims.  There is no inconsistency in probing
nonaesthetic properties with computerized techniques and statistical
correlation to pursue critical aesthetic aims</i>.<p>


<h3><a NAME="Section7">7. Aesthetic Model</a></h3>

<p>[7.1] In contrast to Brown and Dempster&rsquo;s scientific model, I propose
the following aesthetic model, which is, for the most part, already
operative: First: The only way to challenge a music theory or analysis
is simply to scrutinize it, not test it.  Such scrutiny can only take
the form of a critical dialogue among theorists and
analysts. Scientifically testing theories and analyses won&rsquo;t
work. Second: Aesthetic properties must remain aesthetic properties:
they cannot be defined by laws of dependence on nonaesthetic
properties.  First hand experience of the particular musical work will
always be necessary for making and corroborating aesthetic claims
about a work or components of a work. Third: The analyst&rsquo;s role is to
use aesthetic concepts to arbitrate between the importance of formal
aspects of a musical system, data regarding music perception, and
peculiarities of the musical work. And the adequacy of a <i>theory</i> can
be gauged by its eventual application in analysis.<p>

[7.2] In this aesthetic model, a music analysis should offer the reader
a perspective by, in effect, saying &ldquo;If you look at it this way you
will see the aesthetic property I see&rdquo; (organic coherence, etc.).  We
tacitly ask the reader to observe, from the score, the aesthetic (and
nonaesthetic) properties discussed in the analysis.  We mention
nonaesthetic properties to support our claim of an aesthetic property;
we guide the reader to the proper perspective to observe the aesthetic
property first hand. A music analysis, like any critical analysis,
serves to direct attention to what is not obvious to casual or
uninstructed inspection; it doesn&rsquo;t substitute for first hand
experience of the particular musical work. The analyst&rsquo;s presentation
&ldquo;will always reflect a <i>critical</i> attitude toward the piece.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> The
reader of the analysis verifies the adequacy of this critical attitude
through first hand observation, in an effort to &ldquo;hear the piece
better.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup> Of course, the aesthetic model should allow for
revisions of theories and analyses also (naturalizing), but with
critical aesthetic aims in mind, rather than empirical scientific
ones.<p>

<h3><a NAME="Section8">8. Conclusion</a></h3>

<p>[8.1] So why is it so easy to lose sight of the critical aesthetic aims
of music analysis and theory? That&rsquo;s open for speculation.  Perhaps we
don&rsquo;t need medicine so much for the tree and its roots (theory and
its ultimate aims), but for the branches of the tree (the mode of
presentation of analyses): they just don&rsquo;t seem to get us close enough
to the sky (hearing the music better).  Music analyses typically take
the form of a combination of prose, selected musical examples, and
mathematical formulations. When global pictures of a work are
presented, they usually are either sketchy reductions
(e.g. Schenkerian graphs), or pictures of a single dimension of the
music (one dimensional pitch space).<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Recently, computer technology
has made it possible to present ideas, and data, more flexibly, more
creatively. Perhaps, more intuitive and comprehensive ways of
presenting the subtle and precise concepts of music theory and
analysis are on the horizon.</p>

investigation Babbitt has in mind is directly concerned only with
nonaesthetic properties, not empirically driven prediction of
aesthetic properties. Milton Babbitt, &ldquo;The Structure and Function
of Music Theory,&rdquo; in Boretz &amp; Cone, ed., <i>Perspectives on
Contemporary Music Theory</i> (New York: Norton, 1972): 14, 20.

According to Rahn, &ldquo;The game played by music theorists
emphasizes communication, not segregation or prediction.&rdquo; John
Rahn, &ldquo;Notes on Methodology in Music Theory,&rdquo; <i>Journal of Music
Theory</i> 33 (1989): 150.

Boretz emphasizes that analysis serves to demonstrate the
coherence of a musical work by showing the multiplicity of
significant relationships between pitches.
