				<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="5"><a style="color:black" href="#AUTHORNOTE1">Ross W. Duffin</a></font></span></h2><br><br><p><font size='4'>ABSTRACT: Just intonation has a reputation as a chimerical, theoretical system that simply cannot work in practice. This is based on the assessment of most modern authorities and supported by misgivings expressed during the Renaissance when the practice was supposedly at its height.
Looming large among such misgivings are tuning puzzles printed by the 16th-century mathematician, Giovanni Battista Benedetti. However, Renaissance music theorists are so unanimous in advocating the simple acoustical ratios of Just intonation that it seems clear that some reconciliation must have occurred between the theory and practice of it. This article explores the basic theory of Just intonation as well as problematic passages used to deny its practicability, and proposes solutions that attempt to satisfy both the theory and the ear. Ultimately, a resource is offered to help modern performers approach this valuable art.</font></p>

<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>The idea <nobr>. . . </nobr> that one can understand the ratios of musical consonances without experiencing them with the senses is wrong. Nor can one know the theory of music without being versed in its practice.</blockquote>
<p>[1] So begins the first of two letters sent by the mathematician Giovanni Battista Benedetti
to the composer Cipriano de Rore in 1563. Subsequently publishing the letters in
1585,<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> Benedetti was attempting to demonstrate that adhering to principles of Just
intonation, as championed most famously by Gioseffo Zarlino,<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> would, in certain cases, cause the pitch of the ensemble to migrate. This, of
course, raises questions about whether Just intonation can work in practice. His
letters were discussed at length by the late Claude Palisca,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> and I am greatly indebted to his work. However, there remain many
misconceptions about the subject of Just intonation, then and now, so
Benedetti&rsquo;s evidence will form one crucial part of this re-examination of its
theory and practice in Renaissance music.

<p>[2] In modern
times, the use of acoustically pure intervals in musical performance&mdash;Just
intonation&mdash;has not had a very positive reputation. J. Murray Barbour, whose
book, <i>Tuning and Temperament</i> (<a href="#barbour_1951" id="citation_barbour_1951_67dc9b2c2e41d">1951</a> remains a standard
reference more than half a century after its publication, and whose 1958
recording, <i>The Theory and Practice of Just Intonation</i> (<a href="#barbour_1958" id="citation_barbour_1958_67dc9b2c2e420">1958</a> Musurgia A-3), has been one of the few resources available to anyone interested in the subject,
referred to pure major and minor thirds as boring and insipid, and to anyone
advocating a certain form of Just intonation as insane.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> It is difficult to imagine an opinion on tuning more powerfully expressed, and
it makes the consignment of Just intonation to the dustbin of history seem, as
it were, all the more justified. But there was a fundamental flaw in Barbour&rsquo;s
conception of Just intonation, as may be seen in these two statements:<blockquote>
  <p>The characteristic features of Just intonation in its <i>practical</i> application, are demonstrated best and most precisely on keyboard instruments. [emphasis original]
  <p>Of course, it is the severe limitation of just intonation to twelve notes
  in the octave, with enharmonically equivalent notes forbidden, that has
  caused its outright rejection by musicians.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup>
</blockquote>
<p>[3] These things
caused Barbour, in his words, to &ldquo;present just intonation more because of its
significance for the history of musical theory than as a tuning system that was
ever of importance in the world of <i>practical Western music</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> It is a grievous misunderstanding of Just intonation to think that it is meant
to work in a twelve-note octave as found on modern keyboard instruments,
however. Nor does the theory of Just intonation as described by many writers in
the Renaissance ever suggest that a choice must be made between enharmonics.
Barbour&rsquo;s error caused him to offer recordings of supposedly Just chords that
were nothing of the kind. To give one example, his version of the triad on the
second degree of the &ldquo;Just&rdquo; major scale, presented a 9:8 whole tone, a 4:3
fourth, and a 5:3 major sixth above the &ldquo;tonic.&rdquo; In such a chord, the &ldquo;third&rdquo; is
not a pure minor third and the &ldquo;fifth&rdquo; is not a pure fifth above the root. There
are ways to create a pure minor triad on the second degree of the scale&mdash;using a
10:9 rather than a 9:8 whole tone, for instance&mdash;but such solutions are not
explored because they violate Barbour&rsquo;s arbitrary twelve-note octave rule.
Unfortunately, generations of students and scholars have depended on his flawed
exposition as the last word on the issue.<p>[4] Another
burden that Just intonation has had to bear are the studies from the 1930s by
Carl Seashore and others, showing the supposed preference of musicians and
listeners for &ldquo;unjust&rdquo; intervals, including wide major thirds and narrow
diatonic semitones. As Barbour summarized:<blockquote>
  All of   these experiments prove conclusively that singers and instrumentalists
  have no predilection for the so-called <i>natural</i> intervals, and that
  the same is valid for the majority of listeners.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>[5]
This has
been &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; in the psychology of music field for decades. I suggest, however,
that much of a person&rsquo;s preference for intervals depends not on biological
predilection but on aural conditioning, and in the 1930s through the 1950s,
singers and violinists (the usual subjects of such experiments) had probably
never heard Just intervals nor knew any sort of context where their use would
make musical sense. This is not to say that most musicians and listeners today
would react any differently: the stranglehold of equal temperament in our
musical culture has seen to that. But it does not diminish the value of Just
intervals in general, and particularly not in the culture of the Renaissance.<p>
[6] Some writers
have also cast doubt on whether singers, especially, could sound frequencies to
the kind of tolerances necessary to achieve intentional tuning choices.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> Performances and recordings by modern early music groups, such as the Hilliard
Ensemble recording used below, refute that supposition utterly in my opinion,
presenting highly trained voices with minimal vibrato and a level of
accomplishment in tuning accuracy that Seashore, Barbour and their colleagues
probably never imagined.<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[7] It is one
thing, however, for a group of singers to have talent and good ears, and another
for the theory behind a complicated tuning system to be understood, assimilated,
and realized in performance. Refuting the notion that Just intonation is merely
a theoretical system without any practical value will take a precise,
note-by-note analysis of several relevant passages&mdash;the kind of rigorous
examination that, to my knowledge, only theorist and composer Easley Blackwood
has attempted before. But even Blackwood concluded, echoing Barbour, that &ldquo;just
tuning is of no practical use with regard to the existing Western repertoire.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[8] The aim of
this article is to show that view to be erroneous. To do so, it will be
necessary to establish the remarkable level of agreement among Renaissance
theorists on the subject of intervals, to deal with misgivings about Just
intonation expressed during the Renaissance, and finally, to demonstrate how
singers could have accomplished&mdash;and may today accomplish&mdash;Just intonation in the
context of Renaissance polyphony.</p>
<h3>
<a name="background"></a>Theoretical Background</h3>

<p>[9] Beginning
with Ramos de Pareja in 1482,<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> the simple ratios of Just intonation began to be cited by theorists and used in
their divisions of the monochord. Before that, the 3:2 ratio of the pure fifth
and its resulting musical system&mdash;a whole tone derived from two pure fifths and a
major third derived from four pure fifths (in other words, Pythagorean
tuning)&mdash;comprised the almost universal theoretical model. The ratios of the
Pythagorean system, after the 2:1 octave and the 3:2 fifth, were mathematically
complex, however, so Ramos&rsquo;s identification of intervals with simple harmonic
ratios was greeted with near-unanimous acceptance. Just intonation was easy to
support from both a scientific and practical standpoint because the intervals
not only had simple mathematical ratios, they sounded demonstrably better than
those derived from the Pythagorean system.</p>

<p>[10]
<b>
Table 1</b> shows the interval ratios promulgated by a selection of prominent
Renaissance musical theorists. The one famous &ldquo;hold-out&rdquo; who continued to favor
the old Pythagorean system was Gafurius, although he did acknowledge that the
simple ratios were used by practical musicians.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> As may be seen, there is not much disagreement as to what constituted the
correct ratios for intervals: for each theorist I have given those ratios that
are either mentioned explicitly in the text, or can be deduced by the writer&rsquo;s
recommended combination of ratios to create other intervals.<p>[11] Many of the
basic interval ratios are superparticular, where the first number exceeds the
second by one. Thus, an octave is 2:1, a fifth is 3:2, a fourth is 4:3, a pure
major third is 5:4, a pure minor third is 6:5. These &ldquo;six-limit&rdquo; ratios&mdash;the <i>
senarius</i>, or <i>senario,</i> as Zarlino calls them&mdash;are the basic harmonic
intervals. Zarlino attributed almost mystical significance to the <i>senario</i>
in the same way that Pythagoras apparently did to the <i>tetractys</i>&mdash;the first
four numbers. But the intervals represented in the <i>senario</i> cannot be the
only ones in the system because they do not fully account for stepwise motion.
The 9:8 whole tone is in common with the Pythagorean system, but Just intonation
also possesses a 10:9 &ldquo;minor tone&rdquo; which is the difference between a 5:4 (that
is, 10:8) major third and a 9:8 major tone. Like the common harmonic intervals,
those smaller intervals are also part of the harmonic series (the series of
overtones of any naturally produced sound), so the 10:9 ratio, for example, is
simply the distance from the 9th to the 10th harmonic in the overtone series and
thus, in itself, a natural acoustical phenomenon.<p>[12] Other
intervals can be deduced by inversion: the 5:4 pure major third inverts to an
8:5 pure minor sixth. The 6:5 pure minor third similarly inverts to a 5:3 pure
major sixth, the 9:8 major tone to the 16:9 lesser minor seventh, the 10:9 minor
tone to the 9:5 greater minor seventh.<p>[13] It is
perhaps surprising to see ratios for the tritone and the diminished fifth given
by Renaissance theorists. Some of these are given explicitly as numerical
ratios; others were derived by specified combinations of intervals, such as the
tritone as a pure major third plus a major tone (5:4 + 9:8 = 45:32), or a pure
fifth minus a major semitone (3:2 - 15:16 = 45:32). The diminished fifth (or
semi-diapente) is the inversion of that at 64:45, but was also derived as a pure
fourth plus a major semitone (4:3 + 16:15).<p>[14] The semitone
with the lowest ratio in the system, 16:15, can be derived as the difference
between the 4:3 fourth and the 5:4 major third, but of course, it also exists as
that interval in the harmonic series, as the distance between the ascending
overtones gets smaller and smaller. Regarding the other semitone sizes, two of
them consist of differences between the 16:15 major semitone and the two
different sizes of whole tone: Subtract a 16:15 major semitone from a 10:9 minor
tone and the 25:24 semitone remains (10:9 - 15:16 = 25:24); subtract it from a
9:8 major tone and the 135:128 semitone remains (9:8 - 15:16 = 135:128).<p>[15] That
accounts for most of the ratios in Table 1, with the exception of the semitones
given by Vicentino, and the 10:7 ratio given for the tritone by Cardanus.
Vicentino&rsquo;s semitones seem a simple arithmetical way to divide the 9:8 (18:16)
major tone, and the 18:17 ratio, in particular, found some use, at least, in
lute fretting schemes in the Renaissance. The idea of dividing the whole tone in
this way stems from Boethius's early sixth-century <i>De Institutione Musica</i>
I.16.<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> So-called septimal ratios&mdash;those using the seventh harmonic, like 10:7&mdash;are often
considered by modern theorists as part of the Just scale, but with the exception
of Cardan&rsquo;s citation, they were clearly avoided by Renaissance theorists and,
indeed, I believe they were not normally part of the Renaissance harmonic and
melodic vocabulary.</p>

<p>[16]
<b>Table 2</b> gives the ratios and cents values for Just intervals, along with a
selection of other intervals for comparison. One characteristic of the
differences between Pythagorean-derived notes and notes in Just intonation is
that they are separated by a syntonic comma. The syntonic comma is a microtonal
interval which is the difference between the Pythagorean major third, or ditone,
at 81:64&mdash;that is, two consecutive 9:8 whole tones&mdash;and the pure major third at
5:4, or 80:64. Thus, the syntonic comma has the ratio 81:80. This small interval
can thus be recognized as the difference between a major tone and a minor tone,
and between Just intervals and their Pythagorean equivalents. Modern theorist
and composer Easley Blackwood&rsquo;s comma-variant notation of C<sub>0</sub>, C<sub>+1</sub>,
and so on, is extremely useful, both for discussions and charts of intervals, as
in Tables 1 &amp; 2, as well as in annotating musical scores.<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> Briefly, octaves, fifths, fourths, and major tones that are pure to one another
have the same annotation; major thirds, major sixths, and minor tones are all
narrow by one comma; minor thirds and minor sixths are wide by one comma. I will
use Blackwood&rsquo;s system for analyzing Benedetti&rsquo;s problematic progressions, as
well as the difficult passages he himself culled from the works of Orlando di
Lasso.</p>

<p>

[17] First, I
need to mention some other very small intervals in Table 2. One is the
Pythagorean comma, which is the difference between 12 pure fifths and 7 pure
octaves. It is larger than the syntonic comma by a miniscule interval called a
schisma. This is also the amount by which a pure fifth exceeds an equal-tempered
fifth, as well as the amount by which a syntonic comma exceeds the diesis in the
Just system&mdash;the diesis being the discrepancy between diatonic versions of <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> and
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>D<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>, for example. There are thus three closely related microtonal intervals of
about the same size&mdash;the syntonic comma and intervals one schisma on either side
of it&mdash;and these sometimes all get loosely referred to as commas without further
definition. Vicente Lusitano, for example, refers to the discrepancy between the
major and minor semitone&mdash;the diesis&mdash;as a comma, suggesting that for practical
purposes in Renaissance performance, they were probably indistinguishable.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup> These three microtonal intervals are given in <b>Table 3</b>, with buttons for hearing
their sound produced by electronic means. As with all of the sound examples in
this article, these representations are correct to within one cent (1/100 of an
equal-tempered semitone)&mdash;typically much closer than that.<p>

[18] These kinds
of discrepancies and, indeed, the whole system of Just intervals may seem arcane
to modern musicians (and even to musicologists), but, as shown by Table 1, these
ratios constituted the essence of intervallic relationships in the Renaissance.
The principal intervals of Just intonation are given in <b>Table
4</b>, along with
sound files with consecutive and simultaneous demonstrations of the intervals.<p>

[19] The
remarkable degree of agreement among Renaissance theorists, particularly with
regard to the most common harmonic intervals, leads inexorably to the conclusion
that Just intervals were preferred in both theory and&mdash;as even the theoretically
objecting Gafurius confirms&mdash;in practice. The &ldquo;sounding number&rdquo; of these pure
ratios, furthermore, would be experienced by singers&mdash;reinforced, in a live
acoustic, by various combination tones&mdash;as sonorous, beatless, tranquil chords
which, I believe, would have been the constant goal of performers. At the very
least, from the historical evidence, it may reasonably be inferred that Just
intonation represents an aesthetic preference over other systems on the part of
Renaissance musicians generally, and that attempts should be made to explore
Just intonation as a way of understanding that preference. However, Benedetti&rsquo;s
shrewdly conceived progressions, discussed below, as well as the complaints of
Zarlino&rsquo;s erstwhile pupil Vincenzo Galilei,<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> have led modern scholars to believe that the use of these Just intervals as
recommended by the theorists was unsustainable, and that temperament&mdash;even equal
temperament&mdash;was the necessary result. I hope to show that such a conclusion is
not inevitable.</p>
<h3><a name="puzzles"></a>Benedetti&rsquo;s Puzzles</h3>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1a</b>. Benedetti&rsquo;s first passage in his own version</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="duffin_examples.php?id=4&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 1a thumbnail" src="duffin_ex1a_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>


<p>[20] In his
second letter to Cipriano de Rore, Benedetti gave the progression shown in <b>Example 1a</b>, and demonstrated, as illustrated here in Blackwood-style numeric
annotations, that using Just ratios would cause the pitch to rise by a comma for
each repetition of the two-measure pattern. I use the term &ldquo;puzzle&rdquo; for this and
Benedetti&rsquo;s other progression since we are clearly left to wonder what the
&ldquo;solution&rdquo; is if these passages are not to migrate microtonally. (The sound of
all migrating examples is set to loop so that listeners can hear again where the
passage started in terms of pitch.)<font color="black"> </font>
</p>
<p>[21]
This ascent
results because the singer of the bottom voice tries to make the C at the
beginning of bars 2, 4, and 6, pure as a minor third (or major sixth) against
the A tied over from the previous bar in the top voice. This necessitates
raising the C by one comma, which necessitates raising the G in the top voice in
order to be pure to the sustained C in the bottom, and so forth. There is no
question that the consistent application of the theoretical ratios to the notes
in this passage would result in the comma ascent described by Benedetti and the
presumptive conclusion that Just intonation is impractical. It did not go away,
however, so the problem of comma migration continued to plague theorists for a
long time. Christian Huygens, at the end of the 17th century, noted:</p>
<blockquote>
    For
    if you ask any of our Musicians, why two or more perfect fifths cannot
    be us&rsquo;d regularly in composition; some say &rsquo;tis ... because when you pass
    from one perfect fifth to another, there is such a change made as
    immediately alters your Key, you are got into a new Key before the Ear
    is prepared for it, and the more perfect Chords you use of the same kind
    in Consecution, by so much the more you offend the Ear by these abrupt Changes....</p>

<p>I
    say therefore, if any Persons strike those Sounds which the Musicians
    distinguish by these Letters, C, F, D, G, C, by these agreeable
    Intervals, altogether, perfect, interchangable, ascending and descending
    with the Voice: Now this latter sound C will be one Comma, or very small
    portion lower than the first sounding of C [as shown in Figure 1:]</p>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Therefore we are compell&rsquo;d to use an occult Temperament, and to sing
    these imperfect Intervals, from doing which less offence arises.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup>  </blockquote>
<p>[22]
The comma
descent occurs, of course, because of the wide pure minor third from F to D. In
the 18th-century, the theorist Robert Smith cited Huygens&rsquo; comments on comma
migration, along with a revealing story printed in France in 1707. It refers to
a real situation like the theoretical one described by Benedetti in his second
example below:</p>
<blockquote>
    This
    is also confirmed by what we are told of a monk, who found, by
    subtracting all the ascents of the voice in a certain chant from all its
    descents, that the latter exceeding the former by two commas: so that if
    the ascents and the descents were constantly made by perfect intervals,
    and the chant were repeated but four or five times, the final sound,
    which in that chant should be about the same as the initial, would fall
    about a whole tone below it. But finding that the voices in his quire
    did not vary from the pitch assumed, he concluded that the musical
    ratios, whereby he measured those successive ascents and descents were
    erroneous.<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup>  </blockquote>

<p>[23]
The monk&rsquo;s
example appears to be a strophic piece which, technically, should have migrated
downward by two commas each time through. Thus, &ldquo;four or five times&rdquo; through the
music, starting each stanza on the ending pitch of the previous one, would cause
the piece to drop a total of eight or ten commas respectively (the whole tone
being made up of nine commas). Since the piece didn&rsquo;t descend as predicted, the
monk decided that the harmonic ratios must have been erroneous, but we know they
were not: it was some basic &ldquo;homing instinct&rdquo; on the part of the singers to
maintain their original pitch level. Frequently in the Renaissance, furthermore,
choirs sang in alternatim with organ, making a stable pitch not just desirable
but necessary.<p>

[24]
Indeed,
Benedetti notes that the migration problem does not occur on keyboard
instruments, and recommends a tuning system with tempered fifths ascending to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>and descending to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr>. Claude Palisca says,</p>
  <blockquote>
    Benedetti did not say that his tuning was an equal temperament, but
    since his demonstrations show that all semitones and whole tones should
    be equalized, this would have been a logical goal. Indeed, his tuning
    method is not unlike that proposed by Giovanni Lanfranco in 1533, which
    J. Murray Barbour has interpreted as equal temperament.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup>  </blockquote>
<p>[25]
The method
of tempering fifths up to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> and down to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>E<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> is a classic meantone procedure,
however, and in any case, Mark Lindley disputes Barbour&rsquo;s characterization of
Lanfranco&rsquo;s tuning as equal temperament, seeing, rather, a mild meantone such as
one-fifth comma.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> (Meantone temperaments distribute fractions of the syntonic comma among the
various fifths in the system. They also feature major and minor semitones,
although their whole tones are standard within each system.) Indeed, beginning
with the instructions given by Arnolt Schlick in 1511,<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> theorists had begun to include various forms of meantone in their&mdash;mostly
vernacular&mdash;discussions of tuning. It is always clear, however, that such systems
are intended for the use of instruments rather than singers. Schlick&rsquo;s system
seems to be fifth- or sixth-comma meantone. Aaron&rsquo;s system from his <i>
Toscanello</i> (1523)<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup> is thought by many to have been quarter-comma meantone (the most famous form of
meantone with resulting pure major thirds). Zarlino recommended
two-sevenths-comma meantone in 1558 and changed to quarter-comma in 1571.
Francisco de Salinas in 1577<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> discussed quarter-comma and also recommended third-comma meantone (which has the
added advantage that it works as a nineteen-note equal temperament). In fact,
quarter-comma works as an equal temperament approximation as well, with 31 notes
to the octave, and this is essentially the system proposed by Vicentino for his
arcicembalo in 1555.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup></p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1b</b>.

<p>[26]
Meantone is
certainly one possible &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to these tuning puzzles, although all of the
fifths are quite narrow in anything approaching the quarter-comma variety, and
that&rsquo;s why people continued to look for &ldquo;just&rdquo; solutions that provide at least
some places of repose. <b>Example 1b</b>
gives Benedetti&rsquo;s passage in a succession of meantone
temperaments.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup></p>
<p>[27]
Any choice
of meantone temperament is a trade-off between musical quality and convenience.
The most extreme form given here&mdash;1/3 comma&mdash;has pure minor thirds, which means
that it sounds especially good in modes and pieces that emphasize minor triads.
It can also be used in a 19-note octave to create an extended meantone system.
Its drawbacks, however, include a major third that is narrower than pure, and
a fifth that is extremely narrow. Listeners can hear in the 1/3 comma version
how the odd-numbered measures sound sour since they contain only open fifths,
whereas the even-numbered measures are somewhat better. The 2/7 comma version
sounds similar but slightly better with the improved fifths and major thirds,
and the version in 1/4 comma meantone sounds better still in the open fifths
(though not actually pleasant) and very euphonious in the triads. In 1/5 comma
meantone, the fifths and major thirds are about the same distance from pure
(though the third is wide and the fifth narrow), which means that they beat at a
similar rate and create a kind of &ldquo;vibrato&rdquo; effect that some listeners find
attractive. The 1/6 comma version is slightly better in the fifths but slightly
worse in the major thirds, though they are still quite acceptable--a good
compromise, perhaps. (The virtues of 1/6 comma meantone become evident with more
complex harmonies.)<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup> Finally, the equal tempered version exhibits excellent odd-numbered measures
because its fifths are almost pure, but its major thirds are excruciatingly
wide, causing the even-numbered measures to sound very sour and &ldquo;jangly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>

[28]
While the
use of any temperament would solve the migration problem, and while singers can
learn to adjust to meantone when they are obliged to sing with a keyboard, it
seems very unlikely that these are systems that Renaissance singers, left to
their own devices and singing unaccompanied, would conceive for themselves.
Furthermore, I have yet to discover a single Renaissance pedagogue recommending
such temperaments for singers. Even Benedetti&rsquo;s recommendations, given after
pointing out the difficulty of maintaining Just intonation, are for tempering
&ldquo;in organis &amp; clavicymbalis.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup> 
And it is difficult to imagine that singers would look at his temperament recipe
and say, &ldquo;Oh dear, I won't be able to sing that <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in tune because I&rsquo;ve only got
a <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr>;&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we can&rsquo;t sing that fifth pure.&rdquo; In my experience, that&rsquo;s
not the way singers think.</p>

<p>

[29]
One thing
about the use of Just tuning in Example 1 is that Benedetti assumes that the pitch
of any note would not change throughout its duration and, while this seems like
a reasonable supposition, we don&rsquo;t know for sure, and Benedetti&rsquo;s score (see
<b>Plate 1</b>) with tied notes like modern notation, could be interpreted to invite
that possibility.</p>
<p>[30]
Such
changing pitches have been the basis for the Just tuning solutions of Easley
Blackwood.<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup> 
With apologies to Prof. Blackwood, I think he would try to resolve Benedetti&rsquo;s
tuning puzzle as shown in <b>Example 1c</b>.</p>
<p>[31]
As may be
seen, Blackwood&rsquo;s approach is to allow the pitch of a note to change, so that it
starts at one pitch but adjusts by a comma part way through. Thus, the A in the
top part starts at 0 in order to be pure to the D<sub>0</sub> below it, but it
changes to -1 in order to make a pure minor third (or rather, major sixth) to
the C<sub>0</sub> at the beginning of bar 2. Meanwhile, the E is at -1 to make a
pure major third above the C. All of this allows the G in the top part in bar 2
to stay at 0 against the C<sub>0</sub> and thus prevents the microtonal
modulation of Benedetti&rsquo;s version. </p>
<p>

[32] I think the
mere fact that Benedetti pointed out complications in the use of Just intonation
and gave examples actually supports the case for the its use in Renaissance
polyphony generally. Since he was aware of where the system is vulnerable, he
must have been very familiar with it. I also recognize the theoretical
correctness of Benedetti&rsquo;s version, but in general I agree with Blackwood that
while such microtonal modulation may be unavoidable in some cases, it is
undesirable in most situations. It is especially hard to imagine real musicians
being tempted to adopt a solution that results in progressive departure from the
starting pitch.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 1d</b>.

<p>

[33]
While the
monk&rsquo;s singers in the story given above help to confirm that microtonal
modulation is undesirable (and additionally confirm that choirs were still
thinking about Just intonation in the eighteenth century), I actually find
Easley Blackwood&rsquo;s solutions using mid-note adjustments to be extremely awkward
for performers and strange for listeners. Because of his comma shifts on
suspended notes, it is frequently some harmonically and rhythmically prominent
chord that becomes the conspicuous focus of the adjustment. This raises the
question of whether there is a &ldquo;quasi-just&rdquo; solution that would maintain the
overall pitch level but sacrifice the perfection of certain <i>less</i>
prominent harmonic intervals in order to accomplish that. There are, in fact,
two such possibilities in this passage. One is to sacrifice the purity of the
syncopated D-A fifth in the second half of the first measure, as in <b>Example 1d</b>. This
allows the impure D<sub>0</sub>-A<sub>-1</sub> fifth to occur in a rhythmically
weak position, and then follows that sonority with pure first inversion and root
position triads. It also allows the syncopated canon between the top two voices
to use the same size of whole tone (the minor tone), so this solution has some
melodic logic as well, even though the offending D<sub>0</sub>-A<sub>-1</sub>
fifth, albeit brief and unaccented, is extremely unpleasant. </p>
<p>[34]
In fact, I
chose the timbre for these examples because it actually seems to exaggerate the
effect of the tuning. Just to show that voices in a live acoustic with vibrato
would sound significantly better, I have included an alternative rendering of
Example 1d using a voice-like timbre with vibrato and reverb.</p>
</p>
<p>[35]
This kind of
tuning subtlety is not at all worthwhile when an extensive amount of vibrato is
used, but a pitch variance of 22 cents is negligible for vibrato anyway.
Moreover, using vibrato to cover up imperfections in tuning is something that
happens all the time in performances today, even where the goal is Equal
Temperament.</p>

<p>[36]
An
alternative and perhaps more appealing quasi-Just solution is to sacrifice the
purity of the suspended note in the second measure (see <b>Example 1e</b>). Since that note
resolves downward to form a triad, it is treated like a suspended dissonance, so
harmonic impurity may seem less of an issue even though the variance from the
pure interval is also one comma. And in spite of the fact that the impurity
occurs on a strong beat, it is not as difficult for the performer nor so jarring
for the listener as Blackwood&rsquo;s comma shift.</p>

Benedetti&rsquo;s
second puzzle (see <b>Example
2a</b>) shows downward migration of the pitch level, comma by
comma, in the repetition of a different two-measure pattern. In Benedetti&rsquo;s
version, the E in the bottom part must be at -1 to be pure to the G<sub>0</sub>
in the middle part, and the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> in the top part is at -2 to be a pure major sixth
above that E. The rest follows from overlapping intervals.</p>

<p>[38]
This passage
appears to have a more obvious alternative solution than Benedetti&rsquo;s first
example (see <b>Example
2b</b>). Since the E in the bottom voice is dissonant with the top
voice when it enters, that dissonance overshadows the need for purity in the G-E
minor third. Thus, the impurity of that minor third occurring with a dissonance
is inconsequential, and the rest of the notes can stay stable in pitch.</p>
<p>[39]
It also
happens that G<sub>0</sub> to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr><sub>-1</sub> is a much better tritone than G<sub>0</sub>
to <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>C<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr><sub>-2</sub>&mdash;in fact, it is the theoretically correct, pure tritone, with
a ratio of 45:32 as given by several theorists&mdash;so not much, if anything, is lost
on the harmonic purity side anyway. Using dissonant and unaccented sonorities to
hide momentary imperfections in the tuning thus appears as a potentially
fruitful approach to making Just intonation work in practice. </p>
</p>
<h3><a name="passages"></a>Problematic Passages</h3>
<p>[40]
Benedetti&rsquo;s
puzzles were designed expressly to show potential difficulties in using Just
intonation. Perhaps more relevant to Renaissance music in general is whether the
principles of Just intonation can be made to work on &quot;real&quot; music from the
period&mdash;especially passages that have been identified as problematic from a
tuning standpoint.</p>

<p>[41]
The first
example for this purpose actually comes from a reference by Benedetti himself,<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup> although he did not explain how the tuning was problematic, as he did for the
puzzles. It is the end of Rore&rsquo;s own chanson <i>Hellas, comment</i> which is the
<i>secunda pars</i> of <i>En vos adieux</i>. It is not hard to see what
Benedetti was referring to (see <b>Example
3a</b>). A succession of pure chords will
require the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> in the alto at the end of the second measure to be one comma
higher than the first note of the piece, and an immediate reiteration of the
imitative entries causes the texture to rise yet another comma. The piece is
stable from there to the end but the damage is done.</p>

<p>[42]
Furthermore,
this passage is a <i>petite reprise</i>, so its wholesale repetition would mean
an ascent of four commas if Just ratios were maintained throughout. If, on the
other hand, the singers were required to stay stable in pitch and find a
quasi-Just solution, what could they do? One possibility is shown in <b>Example
3b</b>.</p>
<p>[43]
The
hinge-points here occur at the beginning of bar 3 and the beginning of bar 5. In
both cases, the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and F are allowed to make impure intervals against the D<sub>0</sub>,
which remains pure to the G<sub>0</sub> tied from the previous bar. (To be pure,
<nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-1px'>B<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266d;</span><span></nobr> and F should be at +1, as in Benedetti&rsquo;s version.) In the case of bar 3, this
is a short, unaccented moment with the D in the bass. The clash is worse in bar
5, but is still not very long, and the overall effect of the stable pitch and
otherwise pure harmonies is very favorable. This seems to me a reasonable
solution consistent with tolerating short imperfections in order to maintain a
consistent pitch.</p>

  <p align="left">[44]
Another
source for Renaissance musical passages that are problematic from a Just tuning
standpoint is <i>The Structure of Recognizable Diatonic Tunings</i>, where
theorist and composer Easley Blackwood introduces two examples (see chapter 7,
pp. 129&ndash;53), both from a single motet: Orlando di Lasso&rsquo;s four-voice <i>Ave
regina caelorum.</i> The first passage begins with a problematic circle of
fifths, with suspensions from chord to chord. <b>Example
  4a</b> shows Blackwood&rsquo;s
interpretation of what the passage must have been like if strict Just ratios
were applied.</p>

Describing
the apparently inevitable downward &ldquo;modulation&rdquo; by two commas in five measures
as &ldquo;a distortion of the intent,&rdquo; however, he prefers the version in <b>Example

alternative.</p>

<p>[46]
While
Blackwood avoids microtonal modulation with this version, I personally find both
of these solutions unsatisfactory. They both include wrenching shifts from the
third to the fourth measure that simply cannot be practical, even for musicians
whose main aim is to perform in Just intonation. In the Renaissance, of course,
performers did not have musical scores for calculating possible comma shifts in
the middle of a note, so a wholesale modulation like that at mm. 3&ndash;4 seems
impossible. If these solutions are what Easley Blackwood regards as plausible
realizations of this passage, it is no wonder people have little faith in the
practice of Just tuning. </p>

<p>[47]
My own
solution, shown in <b>Example
4c</b>, begins the same as Blackwood&rsquo;s preferred version, but
avoids microtonal modulation by allowing two impure intervals. In bar 3, the
alto&rsquo;s G<sub>-1</sub> is impure against the C<sub>0</sub> in the tenor and bass,
and in bar 4, the A<sub>-1</sub> in the top voice is impure to the D<sub>0</sub>
in the alto and bass. In both cases, these impure fifths occur as suspensions
against notes a major second or minor seventh away. Thus, the impurity is masked
to a large degree by the dissonant interval that occurs simultaneously, and
there is no other microtonal awkwardness.</p>
<p>[48]
Blackwood&rsquo;s
second example is the last nine measures of Lasso&rsquo;s same <i>Ave regina caelorum</i>
motet (see <b>Example 5a</b>).</p>


<p>[49]
Blackwood
essentially starts a comma lower than he ends (with D at -1, for example) but
keeps a smoothly consistent pitch throughout until he has to &ldquo;pay the piper&rdquo; and
raise the pitch two measures from the end in order to finish at 0. One highly
unusual aspect of his version&mdash;really a side-issue here&mdash;is his choice of tuning
for the second note in the sixth measure of the Alto part. I have represented it
as -x since it is outside the usual comma units of the Just system. What
Blackwood says in his discussion of this passage is that, since the chord is
like a dominant seventh, he wants a note at the 7th harmonic over G. This note
is lower by about 27 cents (1.25 comma) than the note we expect, which is F<sub>0</sub>.
Here, I personally think Blackwood&rsquo;s choice is vertical priority run amok,
especially since the note doesn&rsquo;t even resolve like it should in a dominant
seventh progression. Placing that note in a melodic context is something no
performer of Renaissance music would find intuitive or gratifying.</p><p>[50]
My own
solution, shown in <b>Example
5b</b>, relies on what I perceive to be the most likely
placement of the notes in certain modes. Since the passage starts by firmly
outlining the A mode, the positions of the notes correspond most closely to the
tendencies in that mode, including F and C at +1. The beginning of the third
measure begins a transition to G mode. The A mode flickers again briefly in the
second measure of the second line before G mode settles in once and for all.</p>
<p>[51]
Whereas
Blackwood delays the comma ascent to the final until the second last measure, my
version manages to maintain a more stable pitch throughout by fudging the
transition from A mode to G mode in the middle of bar 3. The problem there is
that the C wants to be pure to the G in the middle of the measure, but also
wants to be pure to the A at the beginning. What I have done is to make the C
pure to the A at the beginning of the measure and allow the C to be impure
against the G in the middle. This choice is made because the latter C is a
dissonant suspension, so its impurity is more easily tolerated. The second
awkward moment in my version occurs at the beginning of bar 6, where there is a
shift to G at +1, and the tenor part even has to raise a consecutive B. The
problem here is that the modal orientation is unstable and the temporary focus
on A requires C at +1, necessitating G<sub>+1</sub> when the two overlap. The B
and E at the beginning of bar 6 could be kept at -1, as in Blackwood&rsquo;s solution,
but sooner or later the texture must rise by a comma, whether at the beginning
of bar 7, or bar 8 (as in Blackwood's version). Example 5b seems to me the best
solution.</p>
<h3><a name="possible"></a>Is Just Tuning Possible?</h3>
<p>[52]
Benedetti&rsquo;s
puzzles have reinforced the modern view that Just tuning is impossible in
practice&mdash;that the theory of pure intervals was not transferable to the real
world of musical sound even though the ratios were set forth so unanimously by
theorists of the Renaissance. It is true that Zarlino, perhaps the most
conspicuous champion of Just tuning, had to endure criticism from colleagues at
the time. But even Vincenzo Galilei, Zarlino&rsquo;s &ldquo;most outspoken and severest
critic,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup> in 1589 had to admit that, in practice, singers do use pure intervals rather
than tempered ones:</p>
<blockquote>
    <nobr>. . . </nobr>
    truly, voices sing musical intervals in their true and perfect ratio,
    whereas most artificial musical instruments play them more or less
    distantly from their true form.<sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>[53]
Among modern
critics, Palisca and others implicitly or explicitly call for some form of
temperament as the only solution. As Palisca says:</p>
<blockquote>
    In
    [Benedetti&rsquo;s] examples, the performance will continue on an even keel
    only if the true intervals of the <i>senario</i> recommended by Zarlino
    are abandoned through judicious adjustments by the singers. A system of
    temperament thus becomes a necessity.
    <p>The
    solution to the problem is obviously equal semitones and tones, or what
    is called equal temperament.<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup></p>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[54]
Without
endorsing temperament, other critics simply discount the utility of Just
intonation, as in Blackwood&rsquo;s comments cited in the Introduction above,<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup> and Mark Lindley&rsquo;s characterization of Zarlino&rsquo;s flexible Just system based on
the <i>senario</i> as &ldquo;metaphysically inspired nonsense.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup>&nbsp;<p>
[55]
The fact is,
the evidence suggests that Renaissance singers did try to follow the precepts of
Just intonation, using simple ratios for both melodic and harmonic intervals
wherever possible, and since they did not seem to migrate in pitch as would have
been inevitable with strict adherence to Just ratios, it behooves us, I believe,
to try to figure out what they did. As I hope I have shown, it is possible in
problematic passages, and even in Benedetti&rsquo;s puzzles, to devise solutions that
follow principles of Just tuning but that modify only one or two pure intervals,
rather than the entire system, as does temperament. This is a compromise,
certainly, but I don't believe it invalidates the whole concept of Just
intonation nor necessitates the total replacement of Just tuning with some form
of temperament. Moreover, most Renaissance choral works do not contain many
tuning problems, if any at all, and thus allow the singers to pursue a goal of
Just intonation without the kind of severe difficulty encountered in the
Benedetti examples.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px">
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Example 6</b>. Thomas Tallis, <i>Lamentations of Jeremiah</i> (end of the 1st part)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="duffin_examples.php?id=20&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Example 6 thumbnail" src="duffin_ex6_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge and listen)</font></p></div>

<p>[56]
As a
demonstration of this, I have chosen part of a piece apparently composed around
the time Benedetti was writing to Rore&mdash;the end of the first part of the Tallis
Lamentations (see <b>Example
6</b>)&mdash;and have annotated an untexted score with the notes as
they appear, and changes as necessary. The sound examples include an electronic
performance to demonstrate the Just ratios under controlled circumstances, a
recording by the Hilliard Ensemble (<i>Thomas Tallis: Lamentations of Jeremiah</i>,
ECM 1341 833 308&ndash;2 (1987), trk 1 excerpt), used with the kind permission of ECM
Records, and lastly, for comparison, an electronic version in equal temperament.
While there are one or two notes in the human performance that may not be
absolutely perfect (I&rsquo;m thinking in particular of the top part in mm. 132&ndash;34),
it still illustrates, overall, that the ideals of Just intonation can be
achieved in practice with stunning effect.</p>
<p>[57]
The members
of The Hilliard Ensemble managed to solve the tuning problems successfully and
create a version that approaches Just intonation, and my annotated
score&mdash;buttressed by my electronic re-creation of a Just version&mdash;shows how I
think that was accomplished. There are actually no tuning problem spots at all,
which is why on the annotated score I&rsquo;ve basically shown only where notes change
from their previous positions. The entire passage is mostly in the A mode
although it moves briefly to the G mode at m. 129. At m. 136, overlap with G<sub>+1</sub>
in the lower voices requires D to be at +1 in the top voice, but the excursion
is brief and there is no awkwardness in getting back to D<sub>0</sub>. The
essential point, of course, is how astonishing the live performance sounds with
this kind of tuning. The final chord in the Hilliard Ensemble performance is one
of the most extraordinary examples of perfect tuning I have ever heard, and once
when I played it for a performance practice class, one student wrote afterwards
that Just tuning was &ldquo;shocking.&rdquo; Indeed, it is shocking that the effect of Just
intonation in performance is so striking, and shocking also that we don't get to
hear it more often!</p>
<p>[58]
Remembering
Benedetti&rsquo;s epigrammatic comment about experiencing the ratios with the senses,
I don&rsquo;t think anyone would argue that such a performance would be improved by
the use of tempered fifths and thirds, and I trust the electronic ET version
makes that amply clear. In fact, such vivid practical demonstrations help us
understand that music students in the Renaissance had good reason to reconcile
their teachers&rsquo; basic theory of Just intonation with their own practice of it,
and rather than abandoning it all for the compromise of temperament, they must
have found a way to make it work. The answer to the question &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
must therefore be a resounding &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; The next question must be: &ldquo;How can we
begin to reconstruct such a practice in our own time?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="approach"></a>A New Approach</h3>
<p>[59]
Ensemble
music from the Renaissance (as well as from the later Middle Ages) and less
complex later music can work in Just intonation and is much enhanced by its use.
And even if the exact theoretical ratios are not achieved, it is still possible
for performers to make conscious adjustments that will help to &ldquo;justify&rdquo; the
tuning and make the music sound better acoustically and closer to a Renaissance
ideal. Most performers, however, have no idea how to begin. As may have been
evident in my discussion of the problematic passages cited by Blackwood, the
theory that I have developed over the last few years is that the practice of
Just intonation is based on the prevailing mode of the music. I have elsewhere
written at length about the theory behind it.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup> What modern performers need to understand first of all, is that
<font color="black"><b>notes have certain placement tendencies in each of the
modal centers: F, C, G, D, and A/E</b></font> (I consider the latter pair of
finals together since, in my experience, they seem to use an almost identical
scale). In order to approach Just intonation, then, performers need to gain a
fair idea of where the notes are likely to be found in each mode, and how to
find alternatives when problems arise, or when the modal center shifts within a
section or passage. </p>
<p>[60]
It&rsquo;s easy
enough to look at an individual chord and say, &ldquo;Oh yes, these intervals need to
be pure.&rdquo; The difficulty comes in figuring out how a perfectly tuned chord is
approached and succeeded by other perfectly tuned chords. For example, is the
major 3rd of some triad pure because the third is low, or because the root is
high? Both solutions can work but each requires a microtonally distinct interval
of approach and departure for the root and third of the chord, and one solution
is usually better than another depending on the mode and the context.
<font color="black"><b>At the point of making the choice between possible
solutions, the vertical/harmonic puzzle of Just intonation becomes a
horizontal/melodic one for the individual performer.</b></font> This is the crux
of the issue. Notes in Just intonation are certainly not found along the Equal
Tempered scale, and they are not always in the same place. Thus, the precise
placement of the pitches and the various sizes of melodic intervals are not
always predictable, especially to someone reading a single musical line. <b>
<font color="black">Performers need to develop the ability to use different
sizes of the same written interval, along with a sense of melodic tendencies in
each mode</font></b> that can help them make choices depending on the harmonic
and melodic context. Low sharps, high flats, and wide leading tones are a good
place to start, but there is more to it than that. </p>
<p>[61]
Refining the
different sizes of semitone is the most difficult part of Just intonation for
performers, although <b><font color="black">in practice the semitones are mostly
112 cents</font></b> (0 up to +1, or -1 up to 0, as in typical leading tones) <b>
<font color="black">or 92 cents</font></b> (0 up to -1, or +1 up to 0, as in
typical chromatic alterations of a note). The largest and smallest semitones do
occur in chromatic passages, however. Practice in recognizing and
differentiating the different sizes of whole tone and semitone is crucial to
achieving Just intonation.</p>
<p>[62]
To enable
performers to explore the harmonic and melodic requirements of performing in
Just intonation, and to learn this skill by practice, I composed five Just
tuning exercises which accompany this discussion. The point of these exercises
is to familiarize musicians with the kinds of adjustments necessary to sing or
play in Just intonation, and to help them to recognize similar situations in the
music they perform. The exercises are sometimes highly chromatic, but in a way
that reflects harmonies and progressions found in music from the later 16th and
early 17th centuries. (Students of the era will no doubt enjoy tracing the
echoes of familiar passages in the various progressions.) Performers who can
negotiate Just tuning in the complicated progressions given here should have
little problem with most ensemble music in these modes!</p>
<p>[63] The exercises were composed originally in the year 2000 for the use of
the Early Music Singers at Case Western Reserve University. The sound is
organ-like, with a blendable timbre and stable pitch (although the computer
clearly wrestles with playing dissonant cross relations, suspensions, and even
second inversions, despite the Just tuning). Performers can practice the
exercises by playing or singing along with all voices at once, with a single
voice part alone, or in a &quot;music minus one&quot; situation with the computer omitting
one part. Three different speeds can be selected (M.M. = 30, 55, or 80). To
listen to the individual exercises, click <a href="http://casfaculty.case.edu/ross-duffin/just-tuning-exercises/">here</a>. To view or download a PDF file of the five exercises, click <a href="TuningExercises.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>[64]
Mastery of
these exercises has proven effective in teaching performers </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
      to
    be aware of pure intervals in the harmony</li>
      <li>to make informed guesses as to where to place the notes melodically</li>
      <li>how to make conscious adjustments so the tuning will be better</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
<p>[65]
These are
significant achievements for the members of any ensemble performing Renaissance
music. Moreover, returning to the exercises again and again, and wrestling with
their problems, can deepen the understanding and improve these skills still
further.<h3><a name="problem"></a>Problem Spots in the Exercises</h3>
</p>
<p>[66]
Although
tuning problems are somewhat exaggerated in the Benedetti and Blackwood
examples, &ldquo;real music&rdquo; often does contain isolated passages that have no
solution satisfying every requirement of pure tuning. <b><font color="black">The
most common case occurs where a note carries over from one chord to another and
simply cannot be pure in both.</font></b> While most of the progressions in the
Exercises work beautifully, I have allowed problematic passages to stand,
typically with a choice of note that seems to fit best within the mode but that
may be momentarily unjust. As noted above, this often means choosing to
compromise the minor 3rd, frequently at some point that also includes a
dissonance which helps to cover the impurity. </p>

With more
experience and expertise, singers can perhaps experiment with different
solutions from the ones given here, including &ldquo;mid-note&rdquo; alterations like those
used by Easley Blackwood. Used subtly, with discreet sliding rather than abrupt
changes in pitch, and covered by a softer dynamic, such adjustments might well
represent a possible compromise between his approach and mine. Nevertheless, I
suppose the very existence of such problem spots allows skeptics to continue to
maintain that Just intonation is, after all, a merely theoretical system that
cannot work in practice. However, I believe a serious attempt to master the
approach represented by these exercises will bear fruit, and further, that the
overwhelming beauty of works performed in this way&mdash;even with occasional problem spots&mdash;will amply reward performers and listeners alike, and
&ldquo;justify&rdquo; the
effort. And even if singers are unable to match the exact theoretical positions
of the notes in Just intonation, the fact that they are aware of the system and
come somewhat closer to Just ratios should still make their singing &ldquo;better in
tune&rdquo; according to the criteria expressed so unanimously during the Renaissance.</p>
<h3><a name="rehearsal"></a>Rehearsal Usage</h3>
</p>
<p>[69]
In using
these tuning exercises with performers in a rehearsal situation, conductors
might first wish to indicate each chord, holding some longer than others until
they settle into tune. Eventually, the exercises should move along at a more
even and flowing pace. Especially when first beginning to work with these
exercises, singers may wish to sing &ldquo;ah&rdquo; as a basic vowel sound, with &ldquo;ee&rdquo; for
+1 annotations and &ldquo;oh&rdquo; for -1 annotations. This helps to raise and lower the
pitches of the notes by the kinds of small increments necessary. Eventually,
this extra help shouldn&rsquo;t be needed to find the pitches (which is obviously good
because &ldquo;real&rdquo; texted music has its own vowel requirements). Conductors might
also wish to try transposing up or down from the written pitch, although opening
unisons in some of the exercises will preclude anything but a short distance in
either direction.</p>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>[70]
There has
been a tendency among modern writers to view Just intonation as impossible in
Renaissance musical practice in spite of the overwhelming theoretical evidence
in its support. This study has presented an alternative view, namely, that
Renaissance performers would have preferred solutions that favor Just intonation
wherever and whenever possible, and that deviations from it would have been
momentary adjustments to individual intervals, rather than wholesale adoption of
temperament schemes. This would have allowed them to follow the prevailing
theoretical precepts of simple acoustical ratios as much as possible, while
avoiding such pitfalls as progressive transposition, comma by comma, in passages
with circles of fifths in overlapping sonorities. This conclusion is based on
careful analysis and reinterpretation of some of the most problematic passages
that have been put forward to demonstrate the supposed impossibility of Just
intonation.<p>[71] The Renaissance system of tuning for non-fixed instruments
and voices (as well as the late-medieval system, for that matter), according to
this new conclusion, was based on certain note placement tendencies within each
of the modal centers. As a demonstration of that, and to provide practical
examples for performers wishing to explore this approach, a series of highly
chromatic Just Tuning Exercises in each of the modal centers has been provided
in score and in sound, and the problematic passages within them discussed. These
Exercises are intended for both private practice (using the sound versions) and
rehearsal usage using the scores in an ensemble setting. They are proving to be
effective in furthering the understanding and skill of performers in the use of
Just intonation for Renaissance music.</p>

Technology in Stockholm, include <a href="#ternstr&ouml;m_and_sundberg_1986" id="citation_ternstr&ouml;m_and_sundberg_1986_67dc9b2c2b0ac">Ternstr&ouml;m and Sundberg 1986</a>, 12-22; <a href="#ternstr&ouml;m_and_sundberg_1988" id="citation_ternstr&ouml;m_and_sundberg_1988_67dc9b2c2b0ae">Ternstr&ouml;m and Sundberg 1988</a>. Most recently, Ternstr&ouml;m and Duane Richard Karna opine that &ldquo;there should

impossible for singers to come reliably closer to a certain frequency than about
a fifth of a semitone. See <a href="#h_seashore_1936" id="citation_h_seashore_1936_67dc9b2c2b0b2">H.

But the Hilliard Ensemble recording excerpt given below, in a sampling of major
chords at eleven points throughout, gives an average major 10th (the most common
voicing for the third) with a ratio of 2.507 above the root. This compares with
the pure ratio of 2.500 and the ET ratio of 2.520, and represents a predilection
for thirds that are twice as close to pure as they are to ET, as well as a
tuning accuracy six times closer to the intended frequency than that predicted
above. The excerpt also ends with a chord sustained with astonishingly pure
tuning over a full eight seconds duration. It takes remarkable precision and
extraordinary vocal control to maintain such a beautifully tuned chord for so
long, but this recording shows that it is possible, and that our expectations
for ensemble singing should be adjusted accordingly. Indeed, even Ternstr&ouml;m and
Karna acknowledge that &ldquo;vocal groups that perform close harmony with one voice
to a part <nobr>. . .</nobr> strive to achieve harmonies that are so precisely tuned and so
straight in pitch that the voices fuse together and we hear one instrumentlike
chord rather than several part singers.&rdquo; See <a href="#ternstr&ouml;m_and_karna_2002" id="citation_ternstr&ouml;m_and_karna_2002_67dc9b2c2b0b5">Ternstr&ouml;m and Karna 2002</a>, p. 280.<br><a href="#FN9REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN10">10.</a> <a href="#blackwood_1985" id="citation_blackwood_1985_67dc9b2c2b0b6">Blackwood 1985</a>, p. 153.<br><a href="#FN10REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN11">11.</a> <a href="#pareja_1482" id="citation_pareja_1482_67dc9b2c2b0b7">Pareja 1482</a>.

This is a long and complicated discussion, but on pp. 432&ndash;433, for example, he describes his whole tone as made up of five &ldquo;dieses&rdquo; or commas, of which three belong to the major semitone and two to the minor semitone. Thus, an octave consists of seven major semitones (7 x 3 = 21) plus five minor semitones (5 x 2 = 10), or of five whole tones (5 x 5 = 25) plus two major semitones (2 x 3 = 6), both of which methods give a total of thirty-one equal parts.<br><a href="#FN24REF">Return to text</a></p><p><a name="FN25">25.</a> It is not sufficiently recognized, I believe, that each of these meantone

This is a long and complicated discussion, but on pp. 432&ndash;433, for example, he describes his whole tone as made up of five &ldquo;dieses&rdquo; or commas, of which three belong to the major semitone and two to the minor semitone. Thus, an octave consists of seven major semitones (7 x 3 = 21) plus five minor semitones (5 x 2 = 10), or of five whole tones (5 x 5 = 25) plus two major semitones (2 x 3 = 6), both of which methods give a total of thirty-one equal parts.</div><div id="fndiv25" class="flyoverdiv">It is not sufficiently recognized, I believe, that each of these meantone
temperaments possesses one or more Just intervals. Pythagorean tuning is known
to contain pure 5ths and 4ths, of course, but each of the regular meantone
temperaments given in Example 1b has some purity as well.

The fact that each of these systems found adherents in the Renaissance may
have been due, in part, to the presence of these pure intervals and the
consequent enhancement to certain modes and progressions.</div><div id="fndiv26" class="flyoverdiv">See my forthcoming article and practice resource <a href="#duffin_2006" id="citation_duffin_2006_67dc9b2c2b0d3">Duffin 2006</a>, &quot;<a href='http://casfaculty.case.edu/ross-duffin/baroque-ensemble-tuning/'>Baroque Ensemble Tuning in Extended 1/6 Syntonic Comma Meantone</a>.&quot;</div><div id="fndiv27" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#benedetti_1585" id="citation_benedetti_1585_67dc9b2c2b0d5">Benedetti 1585</a>, p. 281.</div><div id="fndiv28" class="flyoverdiv">See <a href="#blackwood_1985" id="citation_blackwood_1985_67dc9b2c2b0d6">Blackwood 1985</a>, especially ch. 7.</div><div id="fndiv29" class="flyoverdiv"><a href="#benedetti_1585" id="citation_benedetti_1585_67dc9b2c2b0d7">Benedetti 1585</a>, p. 278.</div><div id="fndiv30" class="flyoverdiv">So characterized in <a href="#palisca_1994" id="citation_palisca_1994_67dc9b2c2b0d9">Palisca 1994</a>, p. 224.</div><div id="fndiv31" class="flyoverdiv">&ldquo;. . . realmente le voci cosifatte cantano gl&rsquo;intervalli musici nella vera et perfetta forma loro, dove la pi&ugrave; parte degl&rsquo;artifiziali strumenti gli suonano
