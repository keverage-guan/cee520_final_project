<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Originally I thought of making new music in the new musicology my
brief for this session&mdash;actually the slighting of new music, while
nineteenth-century expression remains the norm, something for which I
think there may be significant reasons.  But then I remembered how
much I hate papers that make a big to-do about what somebody <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>
discuss.  (A summer of reading scholarly polemic will activate that
hatred.)  The exception that I&rsquo;m eager to acknowledge is Rose
Rosengard Subotnik&rsquo;s complex treatment of contemporary music,
undertaken in the context of a wide-ranging exploration of different
kinds of listening.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> My engagement with her work has changed the
focus of this presentation, to the issue of what she calls &ldquo;structural
listening,&rdquo; which I see as a central issue for anyone concerned with
music theory.  That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to talk about.  Broadly, I&rsquo;m
going to say that I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about it; but it may take a
while for this to become clear.<p>


[2] Subotnik defines &ldquo;structural listening&rdquo; as &ldquo;a 
method which concentrates attention primarily on the 
formal relationships established over the course of a 
single composition&rdquo; [&ldquo;Deconstruction,&rdquo; 88].  But 
throughout her work the concept takes its identity from 
its position in a broad system of oppositions, at least 
as much as from any positive definition.  In various 
places in her essays, structure stands opposed to all 
these things: &ldquo;medium,&rdquo; &ldquo;sound,&rdquo; &ldquo;style,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sensuous,&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;the sensuous manifestation of values.&rdquo;  The last is 
from a provocative sentence in Subotnik&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;The 
Challenge of Contemporary Music&rdquo; [<i>Developing 
Variations</i>, 265&ndash;93] that I&rsquo;d like to use to invoke all 
of these oppositions together.  Subotnik is talking about 
popular music here, but unless I misread her utterly, she 
would claim that the situation she refers to is only an 
especially stark version of one that is in fact quite 
general.  &ldquo;What the public hears in such music,&rdquo; she 
writes, &ldquo;is what is always heard, not autonomous 
structure but the sensuous manifestation of particular 
cultural values&rdquo; [&ldquo;Contemporary Music,&rdquo; 288].<p>

[3] What I find most provocative in this is the claim that values can
be heard.  This is a kind of hearing that we don&rsquo;t usually investigate
in our capacity as theorists, to say the least; indeed we shall have
to work a bit at deciding what it would even mean.  But if there is
such a kind of hearing, then it should be within our purview
somehow&mdash;or so I would maintain.  Music theorists had better be people
to whom nothing auditory is alien.<p>

[4] Let me tell you about an experience I had that I understood as an
example of this sort of hearing&mdash;the day before I settled on this
quotation as a talking point, as a matter of fact.  In a way, it was
the fortuity of this quotation shedding light on this incident that
got both of them into this paper.  Marion and I walked into a store in
SoHo; there was music playing.  Without particularly paying attention,
here&rsquo;s what I could hear: a point being made of a thin sound in the
leading lines, an almost simpering voice and an old-fashioned sounding
synthesizer, exposing a more elaborately produced rhythm section in a
way that suggested some flavor of dance music, even though the beat
itself was not particularly intense; and then, against this, the
entrance of a chorus whose utterances, while very quiet and brief,
sounded remarkably full, heavy, and committed, in a way that
immediately said &ldquo;gospel.&rdquo;  For me this choral entrance was a nice
moment: one that changed my hearing of the context in which it was
embedded, bringing out an attribute of what preceded it that I hadn&rsquo;t
particularly noticed&mdash;because really it was the <i>change</i> of tone that
made me hear the initial tone of the thing the way I&rsquo;ve described, as
making a point of having a thin sound, not just happening to have one.<p>

[5] Having mentioned gospel, I&rsquo;m tempted to speak of this upgrade as
the redemption of one sound by another.  No doubt I was meant to: the
words I could pick up were &ldquo;sacrifice and love&rdquo; in the solo voice and
&ldquo;up, and up, and up&rdquo; in the chorus (set in exactly the way you&rsquo;d
expect).  I can&rsquo;t tell you whether I was hearing a secular love song
making a gospel reference or a religious song making use of pop styles
or something more ambiguous.  But I don&rsquo;t need to.  What I mean to do
is report an actual incident of musical perception, with its
accidents, including its omissions; and to acknowledge how I found
styles and their associations coming into play, in a flash, without
much attention, and even though I have no particularly deep knowledge
of, or intense interest in, the styles in question.<p>

[6] I specifically mean to point out how these stylistic and social
images were part of what I heard&mdash; what I <i>heard</i>, not just what I
thought about what I heard.  My sense of what the sounds were, and how
they fit together&mdash;how they &ldquo;worked,&rdquo; as the saying goes&mdash; could not
be separated from the cultural references I heard in those sounds.  I
consider it perfectly possible that acoustically the identical sounds,
without these associations, might not have struck me as interestingly
combined, maybe not even as competently combined.  Certainly the move
from one to the other would have had a different dynamic if all I&rsquo;d
been able to make of it was the entry of more voices.  It&rsquo;s
interesting that I didn&rsquo;t have to <i>believe</i> the styles&rsquo; social
implications to get the point; that is, without actually regarding
dancing as corrupt or religion as redemptive, I could still pick up a
musical dynamic that made use of those notions&mdash;that ran them together
with sonic characteristics in a move from thinner to fuller, with the
latter prompting reconsideration of the former.  Thus, even at the
level of compositional technique&mdash;of my so-called craft
knowledge&mdash;what I noticed was shot through with these cultural
associations.  I wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue how to tell you what I heard and
enjoyed without invoking them.<p>

[7] I hope this gives some idea of what I think Subotnik is calling
attention to in the quotation.  Certainly my hearing of the song was
affected by cultural associations of the styles in question.  In that
sense, it must have been an instance of the kind of non- structural
listening that Subotnik challenges us to consider.  But is it so clear
that the features of the song that I&rsquo;ve described should be considered
not to be structural too?  I&rsquo;ve quoted a definition of structure as
&ldquo;relationships established over the course of a single composition.&rdquo;
Clearly my hearing of the contrasting sounds of the song&rsquo;s verse and
chorus drew on knowledge from outside the piece.  But what about the
relationship I heard between them?  Was the contrast between these
sounds something that existed for me before I heard this piece?  Not
that I know.  And what about the dynamic of moving from the one to the
other?  The change in tone, the enlargement of the sound&mdash;with an
enlargement in the sound&rsquo;s sensed potential significantly exceeding
the actual increase&mdash;all this happening in such a way that the second
sound prompted a reconsideration of the first?  Is it plausible that
these relationships were established other than over the course of
this single composition?  When else?  In short: why shouldn&rsquo;t I be
able to say that a suggestion of gospel in the chorus is a feature of
this work&rsquo;s structure&mdash;even though some aspect of its definition is
extrinsic to this work?  And even: how could I <i>not </i>say that it&rsquo;s a
feature of the work&rsquo;s structure, given that its identity, its meaning
for me as sound, is affected by the relationships in which it
participates?<p>

[8] The forcing of this question is a second respect in which I find
the quotation from Subotnik provocative.  &ldquo;What is always heard&rdquo; by
&ldquo;the public,&rdquo; Subotnik says, is &ldquo;not autonomous structure but the
sensuous manifestation of particular cultural values.&rdquo;  In light of
the questions that my encounter with the song impels me to ask, I
would prefer to read the either-or construction of Subotnik&rsquo;s
remark&mdash;and of much of the article in which it is embedded&mdash;as a
deliberate exaggeration, for the sake of argument.<p>

[9] Part of what Subotnik needs in order to stage what she describes
as &ldquo;A Deconstruction of Structual Listening&rdquo; is a very narrow
definition of structure.  She takes structure to imply something
&ldquo;unchangeable,&rdquo; such that &ldquo;its internal components and relationships
are presumed to have attained something like a status of necessity
which disallows alternative versions&rdquo; [&ldquo;Deconstruction,&rdquo; 101].  She
appears to maintain that the kind of logic needed to sustain this
&ldquo;necessity&rdquo; is available only in those few dimensions of music that
Leonard B. Meyer would call &ldquo;implicative.&rdquo;  And she means structural
autonomy to entail the <i>total </i>absence of external influence, as
opposed to just the presence of <i>some </i>regularities that are peculiar
to the work.<p>

[10] Just how narrow this concept of structure is may be most vivid
from Subotnik&rsquo;s definition of the most important of its opposites,
which is &ldquo;medium.&rdquo;  Medium is &ldquo;a historical parameter<nobr> . . . </nobr>signifying
the ongoing relationship of any composition to a public domain of
sound and culture, from the time of its presentation up to the present
<nobr>. . . </nobr>defined principally through the presentation of sounds,
organized by conventional or characteristic uses<nobr> . . . </nobr>as objects of a
physical yet culturally conditioned perception&rdquo; [&ldquo;Deconstruction,&rdquo;
88].  Is there anything this leaves out?<p>

[11] Curiously, Subotnik&rsquo;s definition of medium reminds me of a
definition of <i>structure </i>once given by Benjamin Boretz.  Nelson
Goodman had accused him of being &ldquo;an ardent formalist,&rdquo; for whom &ldquo;the
actual structure of the work is all that matters.&rdquo;  His cheeky
rejoinder was: &ldquo;since what I call &lsquo;musical structure&rsquo; is just the
coherent juxtaposition of <i>everything </i>relevant to the identity of the
musical work, I can&rsquo;t see what an exclusive concern with musical
structure excludes&rdquo;.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> That&rsquo;s an exaggeration, of course, as I&rsquo;m sure
Boretz would agree; in my life, it happens to have been a more
stimulating exaggeration than ones like Subotnik&rsquo;s.  What it has
stimulated, above all, is a mistrust of the idea that attributing
structure to a work means showing the work to manifest a
self-contained logic of a predetermined kind; an inclination, instead,
to try to think of anything that I hear in a work as open to audible
interaction with anything else, in relationships that can affect its
perceived identity, its meaning for me as sound.<p>

[12] To help me in elaborating this, I want to cite something else of
which Subotnik&rsquo;s definition of medium reminds me.  It&rsquo;s a statement by
David Lewin of what music theory is about: &ldquo;the ways in which, given a
certain body of literature, composers and listeners appear to have
accepted sound as conceptually structured, categorically prior to any
specific piece.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> Like Subotnik&rsquo;s definition of medium, Lewin&rsquo;s
project for music theory is explicitly concerned with the portrayal of
social facts of a certain kind: &ldquo;the ways in which composers and
listeners appear to have accepted sound as conceptually structured.&rdquo;
Between Lewin&rsquo;s concerns and Subotnik&rsquo;s, then, I would see a
difference in focus and direction of scrutiny, not a partitioning of
territory.  I might say that Lewin is specifically concerned to
portray these social facts with their sonic side out.<p>

[13] From my reading of Lewin, then&mdash;as from Boretz&mdash;I feel supported
in saying what I wanted to say before: that the concepts by which
sound was structured for me in my hearing of that song in the store
included ones like &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin,&rdquo; alongside &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; and
&ldquo;downbeat&rdquo; and &ldquo;triad.&rdquo;  Theorists may not be used to thinking of
&ldquo;gospel&rdquo; as a category of sound, but we&rsquo;re not used to thinking of
most categories of sound.  Absurdly, we like to stick to the ones of
which we have something like formal theories&mdash;occasionally even to say
that the ones of which we don&rsquo;t have formal theories are dubious
because they&rsquo;re subjective.  This line of thinking is so dopey that I
can hardly talk about it; let me just express the conviction that
devising categories of sound is fundamental theoretical work, and that
creativity at this is something we ought to value more highly, and
leave it at that.<p>

[14] While saying that &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; is a category of sound, I of course
would not want to say that it&rsquo;s <i>only </i> a category of sound.  My best
reading of Subotnik&rsquo;s exaggeratedly narrow definition of the
structural is as a cautionary portrait of that mistake, a mistake that
I would characterize as an effort to draw a hard boundary between the
sonic aspect of &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; and its other resonances.  But meanwhile my
feeling that it is a category of sound&mdash;among other things&mdash;is what
makes me think that it ought to be admissible somehow under any
definition of structure worth keeping.<p>

[15] A definition of structure worth keeping.  Here I am brought up
short by an ambivalence that for me is the real subject of this talk.
Despite how I may have sounded in the last few minutes, I&rsquo;m not sure
that I think there is a definition of structure worth keeping.
Certainly I think that if there is, it is so little like the one
criticized in Subotnik&rsquo;s article that keeping it would not have to
count as resistance to her critique.  Thus I find myself in the
confusing position of wanting to endorse Subotnik&rsquo;s critique while
rejecting its essential tactic of definition.  And this presents
itself to me not only as a difficulty in taking a position with
respect to Subotnik&rsquo;s work, but as a difficulty in sorting out and
articulating my own inclinations.<p>

[16] This ambivalence strikes me most directly in my feeling the
impulse to contest the definition of the term &ldquo;structure&rdquo; while it has
long since dropped out of my own writing.  (In a moment of positivism,
I ran a check on the computer files of my articles and verified that
this is the case.)  I&rsquo;m sure that I stay away from the word
&ldquo;structure&rdquo; largely to hold off the connotations of it that draw
Subotnik&rsquo;s fire.  Yet I am reluctant simply to fall in with Subotnik&rsquo;s
critique because I am not convinced that these connotations come in an
indissoluble lump of ideological affliction.  I think we have a
freedom of definitional movement that her critique minimizes.<p>

[17] The lump that most cries out for dissolution is the one that
includes the concepts of logic and necessity, what Subotnik describes
as the &ldquo;presumption&rdquo; that a work&rsquo;s structural &ldquo;components and
relationships&rdquo; exhibit a &ldquo;necessity which disallows alternative
versions.&rdquo;  The only sense in which I am ever interested in
attributing logic to pieces is this sense: such-and-such a
configuration of sounds is a reasonable one to have created, given the
intention to elicit such-and-such an effect in such-and-such a
listener.  And this requires having something to say about the effect
and about the listener.  Elide these and you get nonsense: the claim
that such-and-such a configuration of sounds is inherently reasonable.<p>

[18] Thus the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; that an ascription of structure might be
supposed to entail for a work&rsquo;s &ldquo;components and relationships&rdquo;
survives for me only as a tautology: if the components and
relationships were different, then the work would be different.  I
mean significantly different, different in the identity we attribute
to it, in what we make of it.  I would never say that alternatives
were &ldquo;disallowed&rdquo;; only that a change in the components and
relationships that we have made part of our hearing would change the
perceived identity of the work, would make the work different in some
way that matters to us.  In this sense a work&rsquo;s structure is not some
quasi-objective property that keeps the work standing, but one kind of
meaning that we read into it.<p>

[19] Simply put, the structure of a work is <i>whatever happens in
it</i>&mdash;whatever happens, as characterized through the deployment of
whatever concepts help to make the work&rsquo;s identity specific and
interesting for us.  Period.  To speak of a work&rsquo;s structure in this
sense does not mean to find it self-enclosed and logical, any more
than to speak of its style means to find it <i>chic</i>.<p>

[20] Structure thus survives for me only as the designation of a
certain direction of interpretive activity&mdash;the direction concerned
with emphasizing the openness of each sound&rsquo;s identity to definition
through the relationships in which we understand it to participate.
An interest in structure in this sense corresponds to an
anti-essentialist attitude toward sounds, a reluctance to let them be
logos, whose significance is predefined and whose perceptible
characteristics serve only to create an atmosphere about their
referents.  It is above all a determination to block the drawing of a
distinction between sound and meaning.  To hear sounds as particular
music is already to attribute meaning to them; identity as perceived
sound is meaning.  Musical meaning does not end with the attribution
of identity to sounds, but with this it has already begun.  And it is
to the meaningfulness of sound that I need my interpretive practices
to be attuned: I want to be able to move easily among the various
kinds of characteristics that I attribute to sound, regardless of the
supposed internality or externality, the supposed rigor or
contingency, of the factors that elicit these attributions.<p>

[21] Subotnik defines the aim of her &ldquo;Deconstruction of Structural
Listening&rdquo; in two phrases: &ldquo;to reverse the conventionally assumed
priorities&rdquo; between structural and other listening, and &ldquo;to undercut
the distinction&rdquo; between them [&ldquo;Deconstruction,&rdquo; 88].  It puzzles me
to see these offered as paraphrases of each other&mdash;to see the imagined
end state of a distinction&rsquo;s being undercut so nearly identified with
that of its terms being retained in a new ranking.  Admittedly Jacques
Derrida envisions deconstruction as involving both &ldquo;a <i>reversal</i> of
the classical opposition <i>and</i> a general <i>displacement</i> of the
system,&rdquo; the former indeed as a necessary condition for &ldquo;<i>intervening</i>
in the field of oppositions it criticizes&rdquo;; he denies that it can
&ldquo;pass directly to a neutralization.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> But Subotnik seems less
fastidious; in particular her proposal to present structual listening
&ldquo;in Derrida&rsquo;s sense as a &lsquo;supplement&rsquo; to&rdquo; non-structural listening
[&ldquo;Deconstruction,&rdquo; 88] so departs from the usual sense of these
practices (the move she describes would be expected to be made,
paradoxically, in a deconstruction of <i>non</i>-structural listening) that
it comes across as expressing only a rough interest in which of the
preexistent options comes out on top.  As a theorist, I would like to
see the notion of structure that bothers Subotnik and me well and
truly dismantled&mdash;not kept around as a whipping-boy.  So I feel more
solidarity with her project of undercutting than with her project of
rehierarchization.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup><p>

[22] Meanwhile, if my own adaptation of the concept of structure has
denatured it to the point where it is no longer recognizable, that&rsquo;s
fine with me.  My wish is to affirm, by whatever conceptual means, our
involvement as perceivers in the creation of our ontologies of sound,
through the relations by which we imagine them to be configured.  I
see no obstacle in principle to our admitting to these ontologies
entities and relationships that Subotnik places outside the realm of
structure&mdash;<i>certainly</i> no obstacles worth respecting that are set up
by the uncritically accepted connotations of the word &ldquo;structure,&rdquo; by
which connotations I am at least as unimpressed as she is.  The
project to which I want to adjust my concepts is that of expanding as
far as possible our awareness of what the realm of the audible can
include, in the excited expectation that this realm ends only by
opening out into further kinds of meaning, not by hitting a wall.
This is an attitude that I would consider constructive.</p>
