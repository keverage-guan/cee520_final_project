<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] Ellie Hisama&rsquo;s <i>Gendering Musical Modernism: The 
Music of Ruth Crawford, Marion Bauer, and Miriam Gideon</i> (henceforth <i>
GMM</i>) was published in 2001 as part of the &ldquo;Cambridge Studies in Music Theory 
and Analysis,&rdquo; a series edited by Ian Bent. Hisama&rsquo;s book offers analyses of 
specific works by Crawford, Bauer, and Gideon with two interrelated goals: 1) to 
link musical design to each composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;identity&rdquo; and 2) to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; the 
analyses &ldquo;by the conditions of gender and politics within which [the music and 
the composers] exist.&rdquo; (page 2) In his introduction to the series, Bent surveys 
the field of study it encompasses in order to situate <i>GMM.</i> Outlining a 
field in which the strands of &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and &ldquo;theory&rdquo; twine together in 
practice, Bent locates Hisama&rsquo;s book on the analytical strand but also 
characterizes it as a &ldquo;critique of the place of women in <nobr>. . .</nobr> musical 
modernism&rdquo;. (page xiv) Bent&rsquo;s qualification of Hisama&rsquo;s project as a 
&ldquo;critique&rdquo; provides some insight into the import of <i>GMM</i> within the 
practices not only of theory and analysis but also of the broader field of 
musicology.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup></p>
<p>
[2] Bent&rsquo;s introduction defines analysis as a type of 
musical study that can either stand alone as an explanation of how a particular 
piece of music &ldquo;works&rdquo; or serve as a tool for music theory or history.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> As a tool for music theory, analysis is the means by which one generates 
&ldquo;data&rdquo; or &ldquo;facts&rdquo; about pieces; the theorist, generalizing from such gathered 
information, develops a systematic theory to explain musical structure. As a 
tool for music history, analysis is the means by which one discerns information 
about particular pieces or groups of pieces in order to trace broad categories 
of similarity (such as genre or form) or processes of change (historical 
development).</p>
<p>
[3] From the perspective of Bent&rsquo;s typology for music 
analysis, Hisama&rsquo;s <i>GMM</i> does not fit comfortably into either the &ldquo;stand 
alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;tool&rdquo; categories. Hisama&rsquo;s project does not offer &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; 
analyses of particular works nor does it link works together through observed 
features of musical design. Rather, the project designs &ldquo;close readings&rdquo; of 
particular pieces from information about a composer&rsquo;s biography and the 
conditions under which she worked. Like a good amount of recent scholarship 
which proceeds from a composer&rsquo;s social and intellectual context <i>toward</i> 
an understanding of musical design and compositional choice, Hisama&rsquo;s project 
calls into question Bent&rsquo;s typology. The directionality of such recent 
scholarship, from context <i>toward</i> design, has in recent years opened up 
new vistas onto musical creativity, compositional intention, and listening. 
And while Bent&rsquo;s qualification of Hisama&rsquo;s project as &ldquo;critique&rdquo; already hints 
at the limitations of the categories, the typology that underlies his series 
does not easily contain a project premised on the possibility of tracing a line 
from social and intellectual circumstances to the design of a specific aesthetic 
object.</p>
<p>
[4] My review of Hisama&rsquo;s <i>GMM</i> proceeds from the 
issues raised by its challenge to Bent&rsquo;s typology of music scholarship and addresses two 
broad questions: What is the nature of Hisama&rsquo;s approach to an analytical 
understanding of the pieces studied in the book? And, what kinds of 
ramifications do her analyses have for musical understanding in its historical 
and structural guises?</p>
<p>
[5] The three women whose music is the focus of Hisama&rsquo;s 
analyses were active professionally during the middle to later years of the 
20th century. Their birth and death dates are: Bauer, 1887&ndash;1955; Crawford, 
1901&ndash;53; and Gideon, 1906&ndash;96. All were affected by changing attitudes toward and 
expectations for women as professional and creative agents that arose in the 
early years of the 20th century, but only Gideon would have witnessed the 
significant institutional changes that were brought about by the Women&rsquo;s 
Movement of the 1970s.</p>
<p>
[6] The specific works Hisama analyzes are: Crawford, 
movements three and four of the 1931 String Quartet and the song &ldquo;Chinaman, 
Laundryman&rdquo; from the <i>Two Ricercari</i> for voice and piano of 1932; Bauer, &ldquo;Chromaticon&rdquo; 
and &ldquo;Toccata&rdquo; from Four Piano Pieces of 1930; and Gideon, &ldquo;Night is My Sister&rdquo; 
from <i>Sonnets from Fatal Interview</i> for voice and string trio of 1952 and 
&ldquo;Esther&rdquo; from <i>Three Biblical Masks</i> for violin and piano of 1960. Each of 
the analyses begins with an account of the social and personal circumstances 
contextualizing the creation of the music, including: 1) relations of power 
between different contemporaneous social groupings based on race, ethnicity, 
sexuality, and gender, and 2) political and economic realities of the time. 
These circumstances establish the basis of a particular narrative of musical 
structure that is revealed through an analytic interpretation of the music. I 
give a more detailed account of two analyses and summarize the approach and 
findings of the others.</p>

<p>[7.1] Starting from documentary evidence of Crawford&rsquo;s 
dissatisfaction with her treatment as a &ldquo;woman composer&rdquo; from her male teachers 
and colleagues, Hisama offers an analysis demonstrating how her dissatisfaction 
is embodied in musical structure. The analysis focuses on how the &ldquo;voices&rdquo; of 
the string quartet move with respect to one another. Premised on a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; 
registral disposition of voices, the analysis traces the degree of voice 
crossing or &ldquo;twist&rdquo; that occurs over the course of the movement. The 
disposition of voices is defined not by fixed registral spaces but rather by 
relative values of higher or lower. Hisama represents these voice dispositions 
in two kinds of ways. First, a two-dimensional visual model of voice 
&ldquo;twisting&rdquo;, reproduced here as <b>Figure 1</b>, shows the pitch variation of each voice 
over time. And second, Hisama provides a statistical tracking of 
the instances of voice crossing in any given sonority throughout the movement. Dependent on numerical modeling and a notion of a dispositional norm, this type 
of representation allows for a distinction of &ldquo;degree&rdquo;. For instance, a twist 
of &ldquo;0&rdquo; is defined by a sonority whose registration has the cello lowest, viola 
above the cello, violin 2 above the viola, and violin 1 highest. A twist of &ldquo;1&rdquo; 
would entail any inversion of this relative registration: e.g., from low to 
high, viola-cello-violin 2-violin 1. (See <b>Figure 2</b>).</p>
<p>[7.2] This modeling of relative voicing of sonorities 
allows Hisama to trace the changing values of twist throughout the movement. She observes that these varying degrees of twist articulate a design based on a 
series of relatively short cycles.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> The 
cyclical design observed through degree of twist operates in counterpoint to a 
more traditional &ldquo;arch&rdquo; narrative of climax that also occurs in the movement by 
virtue of phenomenal characteristics of absolute pitch height, dynamics, and 
textural activity. The design of climax is understood by Hisama and others to 
function within a traditional musical discourse&mdash;a discourse associated with 
male dominance; the cyclical design articulated by degrees of &ldquo;twist&rdquo; poses an 
alternative and subterranean structure. The movement thus has a &ldquo;double-voiced 
discourse,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> in which a narrative of 
&ldquo;resistance&rdquo; may be understood to operate within a more normative discourse-the 
&ldquo;normative&rdquo; occurring on the &ldquo;more prominent narrative of the music&rsquo;s surface&rdquo; 
and the resistance occurring in another &ldquo;musical space&rdquo;. (page 34) For Hisama, the 
operation of both types of discourse&mdash;that of climax in the phenomenal space of 
dynamics, texture, and register and that of cycles in the subterranean space of 
&ldquo;twist&rdquo;&mdash;is an indication that Crawford exercised creative control not simply by 
inscribing an alternative discourse but further by subverting the dominant 
discourse. That is, the operation of the discourse of cycles &ldquo;foils&rdquo; or 
diminishes the effectiveness of the discourse of climax. </p>
<p>[8] <b>Crawford, Fourth Movement of the String Quartet 
and &ldquo;Chinaman, Laundryman&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>[8.1] Unlike the analysis of the Quartet&rsquo;s third 
movement for which she devises a method to reveal degree of twist, Hisama relies 
on an existing procedure for her analyses of the Quartet&rsquo;s fourth movement and 
for the song &ldquo;Chinaman, Laundryman.&rdquo; Using contour theory as defined by Robert 
Morris (and with additional ideas from Friedmann and Marvin and Laprade), Hisama 
develops a narrative reading from the data generated by this theoretical model.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> In the Quartet movement, an ongoing disparity between the &ldquo;prime 
contours&rdquo; of a &ldquo;female&rdquo; and &ldquo;male&rdquo; line suggest that the &ldquo;female&rdquo; part or line 
is &ldquo;independent, assertive, and daring&rdquo; (page 58) in its exchange with the male 
line. In the song, instances of contour &ldquo;deviance&rdquo; from a norm musically 
inscribes the Asian launderer&rsquo;s resistance to the authority of the dominant 
culture. In both analyses, the narrative of social and personal resistance is 
read through the numerical data generated by contour theory which allows for the 
observation of similarity and difference.</p>
<p>[9] <b>Bauer, Toccata</b> </p>
<p>[9.1] Hisama&rsquo;s analysis of the Toccata builds upon 
circumstantial evidence of Bauer&rsquo;s sexual orientation as a lesbian and a concept 
of &ldquo;non-power&rdquo; articulated by Suzanne Cusick that takes account of lesbian forms 
of relationship.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> The analysis focuses on the 
pianist&rsquo;s hand positions as would occur in a performance of the music. The 
hands are frequently positioned close to one another in the Toccata and often 
the left-hand moves over the right, challenging a normal, non-crossed position. Hisama, following Cusick, reads the hand positions as a metaphorical enactment 
of bodily positions in sexual encounters: who is &ldquo;on top&rdquo; and who &ldquo;on the 
bottom.&rdquo; The power implicit in sexual &ldquo;superiority&rdquo; is called into question 
by lesbian relations and the &ldquo;crossed&rdquo; positions of the right and left hands of 
the Toccata embody the lesbian challenge to the social norms of sexual 
relations.</p>
<p>[9.2] Hisama uses a numerical model to formulate 
differing hand positions, assigning lower numbers to the left-hand and higher 
numbers to the right-hand. Many of the sonorities of the Toccata entail dyads 
in each hand, thus the left hand takes numbers 0 and 1 and the right hand 2 and 
3. In these instances, all possible positions are represented by some 
permutation of the numbers 0&ndash;3. This numerical modeling permits Hisama both to 
name particular hand-positions and to tabulate the number of occurrences of each 
possible one. The tabulation of occurrences allows Hisama to observe the 
frequency in which positions occur and to establish the &lt;0213&gt; position as a 
norm since it occurs most often. However, the statistical aspects of numerical 
modeling play only a small role in Hisama&rsquo;s interpretation; the focus of the 
analysis lies in a narrative in which the differing hand-positions are the 
&ldquo;subjects&rdquo; of the story. The narrative takes account of the changing nature of 
interaction between these subjects and ultimately demonstrates relations that 
&ldquo;permit the flow of power from one party to the other and back.&rdquo; (page 121)</p>
<p>[10] <b>Bauer, &ldquo;Chromaticon&rdquo; and Gideon, &ldquo;Night is My 
Sister&rdquo; and &ldquo;Esther&rdquo;</b> </p>
<p>[10.1] The analyses of each of these three works 
involves a narrative in which some musical object becomes the subject of a story 
that correlates with some aspect of the composer&rsquo;s life. Linking &ldquo;Chromaticon&rdquo; 
to Bauer&rsquo;s explicit concern for &ldquo;equality between unequal groups&rdquo; (page 125), 
Hisama&rsquo;s analysis tells the story of a motive which &ldquo;fends off repeated 
challenges,&rdquo; eventually retaining a position of authority. To tell the story, 
Hisama uses contour and set theory as tools for describing the subjects of the 
story. Gideon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; musically depicts the transformation of the biblical 
character Esther from an indecisive and passive to a forceful and authoritative 
woman. Hisama links the story of Esther to Gideon herself, suggesting that this 
transformation was something she herself desired and that she inscribed the 
process in the music of &ldquo;Esther.&rdquo; The analysis personifies the violin as the 
character Esther and traces the story in two ways. First, Hisama demonstrates 
how the phenomenal characteristics of the violin, including features of 
register, dynamics, articulation, and rhythm, depict a transformation from 
&ldquo;tentative&rdquo; to &ldquo;bold and assertive.&rdquo; (page 168) Second, Hisama shows how the 
violin&rsquo;s relation to the piano&rsquo;s music changes from one of dependence to one of 
independence. To tell this musical story, Hisama uses the descriptive tools of 
set and contour theory.</p>
<p>[10.2] Gideon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Night is my Sister&rdquo; uses a poem from a 
1931 collection by Edna St. Vincent Millay. The collection, taking a female 
perspective and voice, tells about a woman&rsquo;s tumultuous love affair with a man. 
In the poem, the woman, reflecting on her own drowning, berates the man for his 
failure to rescue her. Hisama&rsquo;s analysis shows how Gideon&rsquo;s musical setting of 
the text depicts the pathos of the woman&rsquo;s situation and the apathy of the man. 
The analysis focuses on how features of voice-leading, doubling, meter, and 
texture &ldquo;paint&rdquo; the story of the poem, using set and contour theory and 
traditional terminology as the means to demonstrate how sound correlates with 
verbal meaning. Further, Hisama argues that the song&rsquo;s musically-inscribed 
sympathy with the woman of the poem stands as evidence of Gideon&rsquo;s concern for 
the plight of women as creative agents, despite her refusal to identify as a 
&ldquo;woman composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[11] The analyses that form the core of <i>GMM</i> are 
grounded in a variety of different analytic approaches. Hisama employs both i) 
established techniques for identification and formulation of pitch groups and of 
a musical object&rsquo;s contour and ii) traditional terminology for describing 
voice-leading, doubling, rhythm, and texture. For the analyses of Bauer&rsquo;s 
Toccata and of the third movement from Crawford&rsquo;s String Quartet, however, 
Hisama devises new techniques based on numerical modeling of musical 
relationships: in the first instance for describing &ldquo;hand position types&rdquo; and in 
the second, for revealing a new concept of &ldquo;twist.&rdquo; All of the analyses 
involve a structural narrative that traces musical entities over the course of 
the movement or piece, casting them into a musical story that entails a dramatic 
curve or plot. The structural narrative provides the basis for connecting 
musical design to the composer&rsquo;s identity within a contextualizing social 
framework.</p>
<p>[12] As I suggested earlier, the directionality of this 
sort of inquiry, from biographical and social context toward musical design, 
sheds a new light on our understanding of how music reflects and enacts the 
conditions of its production and reception, but it also raises a number of 
questions about the role of music analysis in revealing music&rsquo;s immersion in 
human existence. These questions have to do with the way that an analytic 
approach &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; the analytic result and with the historical and structural 
ramifications of analytic interpretation. A return to Bent&rsquo;s typology provides 
entry into these issues.</p>
<p>[13] The seven &ldquo;close readings&rdquo; of works by Crawford, 
Bauer, and Gideon that constitute <i>GMM</i> provide the grounds for its 
inclusion in a series on the &ldquo;theory and analysis&rdquo; of music. But the challenge 
that Hisama&rsquo;s work poses to Bent&rsquo;s typology is telling. It is based on the 
observation of what kind of function &ldquo;an analysis&rdquo; has: it can stand alone as a 
revelation of how a piece works through observation of its &ldquo;factual&rdquo; details, or 
it can serve as a tool for revealing &ldquo;facts&rdquo; about musical organization in order 
to make historical or theoretical claims. While not explicitly, the typology 
implies that analytic observation generates objective information&mdash;&ldquo;fact&rdquo;&mdash;which 
is then subject to interpretation. As Mary Poovey has convincingly argued, 
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; are epistemological units that have a history and function as a 
possible&mdash;i.e., not a necessary&mdash; mode of representing the world.<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> In Poovey&rsquo;s 
terms, then, the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; generated through analysis about musical structure are 
units of knowledge arising from historical practices of representing the world: 
analytic facts are not universal truths about the musical object.</p>
<p>[14] The nature of the epistemological status of 
analytic facts is intimately related to the general goals of scholarship moving 
from context toward design. This scholarship, of which Hisama&rsquo;s project is an 
excellent example, stands in opposition to other sorts of musical study which 
are premised on notions of music&rsquo;s autonomy, on its status as a universal 
language. The directionality of scholarship such as Hisama&rsquo;s is grounded in the 
belief that an understanding of music must take into the account the historical 
and social conditions of its creation and reception. However, while it is 
relatively easy to deny music&rsquo;s autonomy and universality, the task of moving 
from context toward design raises some obstacles&mdash;obstacles related to the 
practice of analysis and to the status of the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that it generates.</p>
<p>[15] The problem of demonstrating that and how music 
both reflects and enacts the conditions of its production and reception may not 
be separated from the issue of analysis since it is through the descriptive 
methods of analysis that any kind of assertion about music is made. Following Poovey: analytic techniques, terminology and concepts do not transparently 
reveal musical structure; rather, they construct the particular ways it is 
manifest. Over the last twenty-five years, a number of scholars have been 
engaged in an ongoing critique of analytic discourse, specifically on how the 
discourse is grounded in particular systems of belief. Notable in this regard 
is the work of McClary, Maus, Cusick, Kerman, and Treitler.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> And, particularly relevant here is the suggestion that not only specific terms 
and concepts but also whole systems of analysis play a determinative role in 
what may be observed about music.</p>
<p>[16] To conclude this review, I consider the questions 
raised when this determinative role of analysis is set against the goal of 
demonstrating how a particular work reflects and enacts composer identity and 
social context. Returning to Hisama&rsquo;s analysis of the third movement of 
Crawford&rsquo;s String Quartet, I focus on two issues: 1) &ldquo;how&rdquo; an analysis is 
formulated and 2) &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; analytic observations are intended.</p>
<p>[17] For me, Hisama&rsquo;s analysis of the third movement of 
Crawford&rsquo;s Quartet is the most intriguing and imaginative one of the book. Yet, 
while I find the analysis intellectually fascinating, when I listen I have 
difficulty feeling the presence of her modeling of the string quartet voices in 
terms of &ldquo;twist&rdquo; and &ldquo;cycles.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> The concept 
of &ldquo;twist&rdquo; has a visual presence on the page (as my Figure 1 attests), and it 
may be observed in the numerical and statistical representation that Hisama 
devises. But its aural presence is undermined by the timbral similarity of the 
voices of a string quartet. Further, since the whole movement is characterized 
by a series of long durations and staggered entrances amongst the four parts, 
there is no aurally clear sense of line independence as required by a model of 
&ldquo;twist.&rdquo; The concept of cycle that runs in counterpoint to the discourse of 
climax raises similar questions. Those cycles emerge from the numerical 
representation of voicing as &ldquo;degree of twist,&rdquo; and since the concept of cycle 
is dependent on the concept of twist, the question of presence arises here as 
well. At issue is the nature of the analyst&rsquo;s perceptual engagement with the 
piece and of the mode of representing that engagement. Visual perception of the 
score of Crawford&rsquo;s quartet can confirm the model of twist, an aspect of the 
music that is corroborated by Hisama&rsquo;s visual modeling in the figure cited 
above. Further, the decision to represent &ldquo;twist&rdquo; numerically predisposes 
observation toward questions of &ldquo;degree&rdquo; which in turn allows cyclical patterns 
of degree to emerge. In other words, decisions about how to perceptually engage 
and then to represent the music have an affect on the analytic result.</p>
<p>[18] For the second issue, that of &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; analytic 
observations apply, I revisit the issue of &ldquo;cycles of twist&rdquo; just considered. Hisama characterizes them as a &ldquo;hidden dimension [that] subverts the dominant, 
traditional narrative [of climax].&rdquo; (page 29) It would be possible to counter my 
concern with the aural referent of an analytic concept on the basis of this 
assertion. But, if we allow that this &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; model of structure does not 
require an aural presence, then the question arises for whom does it exist and 
how: does it exist for the analyst and her readers as a secret bit of 
knowledge? Or for the composer as a covert compositional technique? In other 
words, &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; does the analytic observation apply? At its root, this is a 
historical question: does the analysis apply to &ldquo;us&rdquo; in the present, to the 
&ldquo;composer and her audience&rdquo; in the past, or is there no temporal distinction? 
These issues of historical import apply generally to Hisama&rsquo;s project. On one 
hand, each analytic chapter begins with a wealth of intriguing historical 
evidence about the biography of the composer and the circumstances of the work&rsquo;s 
composition. Since this historical evidence &ldquo;informs&rdquo; the analyses, there is 
some reason to assume that analytic observations will be imbued with historical 
significance. But Hisama makes no such claims about the past; rather she states 
that her &ldquo;argument is not based on compositional intention&rdquo; and that her 
analytical study &ldquo;enables a listener to experience new and compelling ways of 
understanding music.&rdquo; (page 10) These statements about &ldquo;intention&rdquo; and &ldquo;listening 
experience&rdquo; locate the relevance of analytic observation in the present. If we 
assume that past and present are conflated in the project, this would amount to 
a claim that hearing is universal and that it cannot be shaped by new modes of 
thought. In other words, such an assumption would negate the point of Hisama&rsquo;s 
project: to enable new modes of musical experience.</p>
<p>[19] The issues of &ldquo;how&rdquo; an analysis is formulated and 
&ldquo;to whom&rdquo; analytic observations are intended arise not only in Hisama&rsquo;s <i>GMM</i> 
but in much scholarship seeking to show how music as a sounding phenomenon 
reflects and enacts the conditions of its production and reception. The 
problem of this correlation between sound design and social/intellectual context 
is most likely the dominant one for music scholarship in the new millennium. The questions that help to define the problem may be grouped around the issues 
of &ldquo;how&rdquo; or the analytic discourse and &ldquo;to whom&rdquo; or the historical reference. 
They are: </p>
<p><b>&ldquo;How&rdquo;<br>
</b>If the goal of an analysis is to make links between 
musical design and composer biography and cultural context, then what kinds of 
analytic discourse should be applied to establish this correlation? Can a 
traditional discourse of technical creation and performative realization bear 
the task of demonstrating how music reflects and enacts the conditions of its 
creation and reception? Does the sign of the correlation between context and 
design reside in the &ldquo;surface&rdquo; details which have perceptual immediacy or in the 
&ldquo;deep&rdquo; structure which is manifest in some analytic modeling, e.g., a numerical 
modeling? </p>
<p><b>&ldquo;To Whom&rdquo;<br>
</b>Does analytic interpretation make claims about the 
conditions under which the composer worked? And if so, is analysis an attempt 
to understand the creation of music in its historical context? If one analyzes 
a work from the past, is analysis an attempt to replicate the historical 
conditions of hearing and creating? Or can analysis only make statements about 
how a listener/performer engages a piece of music in a performance in the 
present? </p>
<p>[20] Hisama&rsquo;s <i>GMM</i> 
is a distinguished example of scholarship that provides insight into the music 
and biographical circumstances of three important composers of musical 
modernism. Through Hisama&rsquo;s work the historical significance of Crawford, 
Bauer, and Gideon has been clearly established as composers and as &ldquo;women&rdquo; who 
composed. Like other similar scholarship, it raises questions of &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;to 
whom&rdquo;&mdash;that is, questions about the determinative role of analytic discourse on 
observation and the historical import of analytic statements. But most 
significantly, Hisama opens up new territory for music scholarship and offers 
analyses that indeed change the ways we hear Crawford&rsquo;s, Bauer&rsquo;s, and Gideon&rsquo;s 
music through imaginative and insightful interpretations.</p>
