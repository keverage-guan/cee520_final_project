<p>[1] &ldquo;Skageraknettverket&rdquo; [&ldquo;The Skagerack Network&rdquo;] is a collaboration
among four institutions in the Nordic countries: The Center for
Cultural Research at Aarhus University, Denmark; The Institute for
Music and Theater at the University of Oslo, Norway; the Department of
Musicology at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden; and the Department
of Musicology at the Turku Academy, Finland. Seminars for the faculty
and graduate students are arranged once a year in the different
participating cities.
<p> 

[2] November 20&ndash;23 &ldquo;The Skagerack Network&rdquo; met at the Lysebu
Conference Center in Oslo. Papers and presentations were given by four
faculty members (Bengt Edlund, Turku Academy; Alf Bj&ouml;rnberg,
University of Gothenburg; Erling Guldbrandsen, Oslo University; Stan
Hawkins, Oslo University), by seven graduate students (Erlend Hovland,
Oslo University; Odd Skorberg, Oslo University; Gjermund
Kolltveit, Oslo University; Per F. Broman, University of Gothenburg;
J&oslash;rgen Langdalen, Oslo University; Karin Petersen, University
of Aarhus; Anne Danielsen, Oslo University), and by the invited guest
speaker Marion Guck, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The
presentations were given in Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, except for
the session on November 22 which was in English. Each presentation was
followed by a half-hour discussion session. Here I will briefly
discuss the papers I think would be of most interest to MTO&rsquo;s
readers.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup><p> 

[3] The conference began with Bengt Edlund&rsquo;s &ldquo;Methodological
Variations on a Given Theme&rdquo; [in Swedish], in which Edlund presented
seven different approaches to analysis. He started by talking about
the Swedish linguist Bj&oslash;rn Lindblom and acoustician Johan
Sundberg&rsquo;s generative method of analysis. In their article &ldquo;Towards a
Generative Theory of Melody,&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> they selected tunes by Alice
Tegn&eacute;r (1864&ndash;1943), the Swedish composer of children&rsquo;s songs,
and generated rules for the behavior of these songs with regard to
meter, rhythm, harmony, melody, and syntactical and stylistical
invariances. The test of this method is to generate melodies according
to the rules and then to verify the outcome by comparing these
generated melodies with the originals. This method works well for
Tegn&eacute;r since her melodies are easy to formalize.
<p> 

[4] Edlund himself had created a melody according to these rules and
it turned out to bear some resemblance to Mozart&rsquo;s theme from the
first movement of the A-major Sonata K.V. 331, which became the focus
of the rest of his presentation. He continued by applying Grosvenor
Cooper and Leonard Meyer&rsquo;s rhythmic theory to the Mozart theme and
showed how the different rhythmic layers could influence the
interpretation of the piece. This was then followed by a brief
discussion of Meyer&rsquo;s implication theory.
<p> 

[5] Edlund&rsquo;s discussion of Schenkerian analysis generated the most
interest. According to Edlund, Mozart&rsquo;s K.V. 331/I is a problematic
movement since the first half works very well as a three-line and the
second as a five-line. To illustrate this problem Edlund presented
three different graphs, those of Schenker, Forte-Gilbert, and
Lester. Edlund found that to cast the piece as either a five-line
(Schenker and Forte-Gilbert) or three-line (Lester), the structure of
the piece has to be violated. His own solution was to completely
ignore traditional Schenkarian concepts and to represent the work as
comprising two separate structural descents, making the first part a
three-line and the second a five-line.
<p> 

[6] In <a href="../mto.97.3.4/mto.97.3.4.broman.html">my 
previous correspondent&rsquo;s report</a>, <i>MTO</i> 3.4 (July 1997), I
was very critical of Edlund&rsquo;s reading of Schenker. I now understand
more why he finds the method frustrating. From his performance and
perception-oriented perspective, the theory should mirror the melodic
foreground. When he did not find the important leap of a third in the
two first measures in any of the graphs he examined, Edlund concluded
that the method must be flawed. However, this erroneous assumption
reflects an insufficient knowledge of Schenkerian techniques and of
the secondary Schenkerian literature. There are Schenkerian ways to
represent the piece so that the important foreground features
appear. One example is David Neumeyer&rsquo;s sketch of K.V. 331 which also
features the innovative three-part Urlinie thereby addressing the
&ldquo;drei oder f&uuml;nf Problem&rdquo; in this piece in a way that may satisfy
Edlund.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup><p> 

[7] Contrary to Edlund&rsquo;s apparent beliefs, Schenkerian techniques do
not have to be static and orthodox monoliths. Charles J. Smith, for
example, has successfully elaborated on Schenker&rsquo;s conception of form,
and in the process has reworked several of Schenker&rsquo;s analyses and
questioned some precepts of his theory.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup><p> 

[8] I can&rsquo;t understand why Edlund seems set on assuming the role of
The Crusader against Schenkerian analysis on a continent where few pay
any attention to the method. He should participate in the North
American and British discourses: both Edlund and the Schenkerian
community would benefit from this as he does indeed possess a
substantial and sound knowledge of tonal theory which would make his
comments on the method valuable.
<p> 

[9] Edlund continued his presentation by briefly showing examples of
Lerdahl and Jackendoff&rsquo;s Generative Analysis. Edlund found this
approach to be more useful than the Schenkerian one for K.V. 331. He
also spoke appreciatively of Nattiez&rsquo;s paradigmatic analysis, which he
applied to this piece.
<p> 

[10] Finally, Edlund tried a narrative strategy in which the ascending
and descending structural scales were seen as antagonists in a plot
reading and also in a gender-oriented reading. Edlund views these
&ldquo;erective&rdquo; ascending scales as masculine and the descending as
feminine, and thus, as a joke, one must hope, finds a Schenkerian
fundamental structure to be feminine.  The conclusion of his lecture
was somehow weak. The point was to prove that different methods of
analyses were useful for different aspects of the analysis. We knew
that already.
<p> 

[11] The Nordic countries have a strong tradition of studies in
popular music and ethnomusicology, and several of the papers that were
given emphasized these areas. Alf Bj&ouml;rnberg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Analysis of
Popular Music or Popular Analysis of Music&rdquo; [in Swedish] was an
eye-opening experience in terms of its emphasis on modes of analysis
other than those invoked in traditional scholarship.
<p> 

[12] Bj&ouml;rnberg discussed the issue of how to analyze the
non-analytical mode of listening (the second half of the title of his
paper). How can we understand the ways in which listeners who are not
trained in music theory perceive music? He referred briefly to Abraham
Moles, <i>Information Theory and Esthetic Perception</i>,<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> which draws on
semantic versus aesthetic complexity and on the &ldquo;parameters of
analysis&rdquo; developed by the Danish Radio programming department. These
seven parameters are guidelines to be considered by producers of any
music-mix program in order to achieve a desired effect:
<p> 

<ol>
  <li>Power (complexity and sound)
  <li>The relation between rhythm and melody
  <li>Performance personality and individuality
  <li>The relation between text and instrument
  <li>Mood (nine semantic fields and accessibility)
  <li>Tempo
  <li>Genre (nineteen different genres, two within Western art music)
</ol>

<p>[13] It turned out that categories one and two have the largest
impact, and three and four a lesser impact, while category six is
important to the flow of the program. Although a non-conclusive
method, the basic concept could surely be developed more rigorously.
<p> 

[14] Odd Skorberg&rsquo;s well-written paper &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s No Better
Music&rsquo;: On Analyzing Value Judgments in our Recent Music History&rdquo; [in
Norwegian] discussed how to interpret and analyze value judgments. His
informant was one of the pioneers of New Orleans jazz in Norway, who
expressed his views on rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. Skorberg considers value
judgments to be a strategical discourse demanding a particular
attention from the researcher.  In this case, Skorberg&rsquo;s
informant made very unfavorable comments about rock. On the question
what musical value he considered the rock bands to have he replied &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think they had any [value]; NOTHING,&rdquo; that is, an answer that by
some could be dismissed as worthless rhetoric and as a self
justification of one&rsquo;s own stylistic preferences. Instead
Skorberg interprets this interview material and reads that
behind the offensive comments there is a painful experience&mdash;that the
informant&rsquo;s homogenous musical world was split up by the introduction
of rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll.  Rock and traditional jazz have become complementary
and cannot be unified.
<p> 

[15] Skorberg finds that complex analyses of value judgments
must take into account levels above the single individual. He
concluded by stating that value judgments can perform an important
function in forming musical histories in all musical contexts.
<p> 

[16] In his lecture &ldquo;Necessary, But Not Enough: On the Role of
Analysis for Understanding Boulez and Musical Modernism&rdquo; [in
Norwegian] Erling E.  Guldbrandsen showed examples from his very
ambitious Ph.D. dissertation in which he attempts to demonstrate
Boulez&rsquo;s compositional process through an examination of Boulez&rsquo;s
sketches for <i>Pli selon pli</i>, housed at the Paul Sacher Stiftung in
Basel.<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> Guldbrandsen claimed that the notion that serialism is a
means for obtaining &ldquo;structural unity, coherence, and rational
compositional control&rdquo; is a misunderstanding. Instead he shows
convincingly that for Boulez serialism is &ldquo;a strategy for producing
new material, material which again constitutes new and unforeseen
compositional and aesthetic possibilities.&rdquo; Guldbrandsen&rsquo;s point in
this paper was that although his sketch studies gave a great deal of
information, the interpretation of the actual music and the poetry
continued to play an important role in his understanding of the piece.
<p> 

[17] Guldbrandsen&rsquo;s presentation gives a good indication of the
Scandinavian definition of analysis. For Guldbrandsen, and most others
in Scandinavia, the analytical part of the study was to reconstruct
the compositional process: to label the rows and to gain a closer
understanding of the artistic considerations. There are no analytical
attempts to structure the work using pitch-class set techniques or
transformational networks.
<p> 

[18] The Saturday session was given entirely in English. Marion Guck&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Idea of Musical Narrative and the Problem of Musical Continuity:
The Case of the Adagio of Haydn&rsquo;s Sonata No. 46&rdquo; gave a beautiful and
very personal phenomenological account of methodological problems
related to narrative strategies. The paper discussed several aspects
of narrativity, including the problems of borrowing theories from
other disciplines (&ldquo;At its worst it seems like dressing up old
concepts in new terms; at its best it seems a fruitful meeting of
different intellectual cultures that can bring a fresh perspective to
the familiar&rdquo;) and of various narrative strategies&mdash;Cone&rsquo;s persona,
motivic analysis as &ldquo;an ordered sequence of plot functions,&rdquo; Lawrence
Kramer&rsquo;s application of the terms narrative, narrativity, and
narratography&mdash;and also problematized the notion of narrative (&ldquo;Is the
story in the musical work [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] or in the analyst?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Recognizing that
music has no narrator, while not definitive, did help me recognize the
directness and intensity of involvement I feel with music as compared
with other works of art; it suggested some ways to account for the
difference.&rdquo;).
<p> 

[19] After discussing two narrtological analyses by Fred Maus,<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> Guck
gave two personal readings of the Adagio movement of Mozart&rsquo;s A-Major
Piano Concerto, K.V. 488. The first interpretation described the
musical feelings in analytical terms: &ldquo;[<nobr> . . . </nobr>] the sounding of the D
chord [in measure 8] creates a disconcerting impression of giving way, but
to something surprisingly welcome. It is a little bit like the
dissolution-into-hope of an egg cracking to reveal the hatchling
within, except that one takes pleasure in the manner of the
dissolution. How is such a contradictory impression achieved? First of
all, the bass&rsquo;s<nobr> . . . </nobr>D is not the only cause. There is also a question
in the upper voice about whether <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>A<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> or A resolves B.&rdquo; The second one
was like poetry&mdash;a pianist&rsquo;s poetic experience of performing the
piece: &ldquo;For the pianist there is a feel of small stretches, often
across sixths, that contrast with closer work. At the opening, after
the small movement of the neighbor, attention moves back and forth
between the thumb and the little finger. [<nobr> . . . </nobr>]<nobr> . . . </nobr>The right hand&rsquo;s
line<nobr> . . . </nobr>stretches<nobr> . . . </nobr>in measure 7, overreaching the <nobr><span style= 'letter-spacing:-0.8px'>G<span style='font-family: Arial Unicode MS, Lucida Sans Unicode;'>&#x266f;</span><span></nobr> that is its goal
to lean from an appoggiatura A [<nobr> . . . </nobr>]. As the phrase begins to repeat,<nobr> . . . </nobr>the orchestra&rsquo;s music becomes less purely broad-stroked and
warm. When the piano returns, we are pleased.&rdquo; It is really a
wonderful description of the introduction of the movement.
<p> 

[20] Guck&rsquo;s second piece was Haydn&rsquo;s Piano Sonata No. 46, her
description of which focused on the formal aspects as revealed through
counterpoint.  Guck then discussed the story she had just been
telling: &ldquo;How does a wholesale repetition [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] fit into story
telling, or a theory of narrative functions, or even a narratological
trajectory?&rdquo; She found Maus&rsquo;s adaptation of G&eacute;rard Genette&rsquo;s
three accounts of the difference between story and
discourse&mdash;&ldquo;Discourse may order events differently from their order in
the story&rdquo;; &ldquo;Story and discourse may differ with regard to the
frequency of an event&rdquo;; and &ldquo;The duration of the discourse, or [<nobr> . . . </nobr>]
the implied time of reading, may differ from the time taken by the
event in the story&rdquo;&mdash;to be a useful distinction in a musical
context.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup><p> 

[21] I found Professor Guck&rsquo;s analyses to be most convincing. They
indeed make musical sense and are also very important from the
pedagogical point of view: It is necessary to show that we theorists
and musicologists really care for the music&mdash;that we have a personal
relation to music&mdash;in the classroom as well as at professional
conferences and in any public discourse.
<p> 

[22] My own contribution, &ldquo;Touching up the Paint or a Complete Vinyl
Residing? Meta-Analytical Strategies in Stephen Ingham&rsquo;s Second Sonata
for Piano and Tape,&rdquo; [in English] discussed British composer Stephen
Ingham&rsquo;s extraordinary Sonata op. 56 (1991) and its blunt use of
pre-fabricated synthesizer sounds and easily recognizable
clich&eacute;s from jazz and art music alike. On first hearing it
could easily be characterized as kitsch.  Drawing from writings by
Peter Berger, Theodor Adorno, Umberto Eco, Susan McClary, Andreas
Huyssen, and others, I explored the tensions between modernistic,
avant-garde, and postmodern modes of reception with regard to <i>objects
trouv&eacute;es</i> and kitsch displaying a new location for the musical
avant-garde: the avant-garde as &ldquo;stylistic dialectics,&rdquo; in which
historical references, pastiche, and confrontations of musical
language provide the driving force and confront the notion of
institutionalized art.  The paper ended with a self-critical
discussion of the methods used and of the conclusions reached, as well
as with a discussion about the influence of different modes of
analysis on the ways in which we perceive music&mdash;the metaphors of
&ldquo;touching up the paint&rdquo; and &ldquo;vinyl residing&rdquo; occupied an important
role in explaining what analysis can achieve&mdash;and how this analysis
relates to recent discourses within the musicology and music theory
communities.
<p> 

[23] J&oslash;rgen Langdalen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Some Songs Simply Don&rsquo;t Want to Be
Analyzed: Gluck and Rousseau,&rdquo; discussed the first scene of Gluck&rsquo;s
<i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> in terms of the function of the chorus, the
recitative, and the aria. Langdalen found that the opera &ldquo;isolates one
of its foundational conventions&mdash;that of the aria&mdash;and puts this
conventional form into play inside the action.&rdquo; Here it does not
primarily support the communication of this or that emotional message
between characters.  According to Langdalen&rsquo;s reading dramatic
<i>vraisemblance</i>, implied by the naturalistic storm music, for example,
isolates Iphigenia&rsquo;s arias and requires the listeners to conceive of
them as songs.
<p> 

[24] Stan Hawkins&rsquo;s fascinating paper, &ldquo;Critical Dodges in Popular
Musicology: Funkamatic vs. Metatextual&rdquo; was written in a very
challenging form, for one narrator and two personae: Professor
Metatextual (&ldquo;a scholar of sociology who stems from a Marxist,
modernist background and is always keen to privilege his text over
others&rdquo;) and Dr. Funkamatic (&ldquo;a musicologist who has grappled for
years with the semiotic analysis of popular music&rdquo;). I will include a
lengthy quote here to give an idea of this &ldquo;play&rdquo;:
</p> 

<blockquote>Dr. F: [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] wasn&rsquo;t it you who said that the enjoyment of music is
<i>not</i> necessarily dependent on an understanding of it? Furthermore,
haven&rsquo;t you always insisted that one&rsquo;s listening experience need not
bear any relevance to the author&rsquo;s own conception of the music? To put
this another way, to what extent is &lsquo;interpretation&rsquo; necessary for
appreciating and enjoying music?
</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Prof. M: I would argue that to work out what is meant by
interpretation we also need to consider the notion of
misinterpretation. [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] What concerns me most here is whether an
&lsquo;incorrect&rsquo; reading actually changes anything for the student or
researcher, and more to the point whether there are &lsquo;dangers&rsquo; in
reading meanings into a piece of music we are not &lsquo;culturally&rsquo;
attached to.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Dr. F: It seems quite clear to me that because musical meaning is
dependent on shared understanding of musical codes there are certain
aspects of western music, at least in the late twentieth century, that
we all take for granted. [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] responses to and tastes in music are
predominantly cultural.
</blockquote> 

<blockquote>Prof. M: This touches on Leonard Meyer&rsquo;s<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> concept of acculturation
which is clearly distinct from that of John Blacking<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> who refutes
the notion that &lsquo;an Englishman cannot possibly understand African,
Indian, and other non-English music.&rsquo; Blacking&rsquo;s research into
cross-cultural musical enjoyment has importantly demonstrated how
feelings in experiencing music can be very similar.
</blockquote> 

<p>[25] This paper was indeed challenging and enlightening: The
understanding of a work, in this case British artist Steven Patrick
Morrisey&rsquo;s political song &ldquo;Margaret on the Guillotine,&rdquo; (a song with
an agressive message against Margaret Thatcher which created a great
deal of turmoil) is not one dimensional nor is the scholar one
dimensional. One important question raised was in what way the
references to musical structures and the low-key sound give this piece
meaning and, perhaps most importantly, what effect Morrisey&rsquo;s voice
has (voice as body, as the person, as the character, and as an musical
instrument).<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> The discussion between the two characters developed
into clear formulations of very basic questions in musical
scholarship: music as social activity, music as cultural organization,
issues of ownership in a social context, and meaning of musicological
analyses.
<p> 

[26] On the last day, November 23, two papers dealing with popular
music were given. Karin Petersen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Genre Drift and Re-Actualizing in
New Youth Music; or, How One Can Analyze Conceptual Works&rdquo; [in Danish]
discussed the music on Mike Flowers Pops album <i>A Groovy Place</i>&mdash;an
album that can be considered a conceptual work in its re-use of covers
of easy listening melodies by Burt Bacharach, Esquivel, and Jimmy
Webb. Petersen claimed that a regular musical analysis is not enough
to reveal the unique features of this work since the harmonic and
rhythmic material is kept the same as the original. She gave hints on
alternative experience-oriented analyses: material and realization,
timbre and texture, and musical sound as medium for a set of
activities (performance, media presentation, etc.). Other important
concepts for the understanding of this work are Mike Flowers Pops&rsquo;s
attack of the authentic rock through a strategy of double mimesis and
the notion that this work constitutes an authentic expression for &ldquo;The
Sampled Generation,&rdquo; that is, a generation with an &ldquo;over developed
meta-cognition and media knowledege&rdquo; that samples from history,
against the recognized genres. As a conclusion Petersen pointed out
that we need to consider the Mike Flowers Pops as well as the works of
Andy Warhol in different aesthetic categories, the simultaneous and
the referential.<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup><p> 

[27] The final paper, Anne Danielsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Different as the Same: On
Analyzing Funk,&rdquo; [in Norwegian] dealt with her experiences trying to
narrow down a genre. She claimed that although a description of the
musical features (most of all the rhythm) is not enough for the
understanding of the genre, there is generally too little analysis in
popular music research.
<p> 

[28] An advantage with small musicological communities is that
gatherings such as this one turn cross cultural and multi
methodological: The Nordic countries (together twice as large as Texas
with almost twice the population of the New England States) are not
large enough for substantial communities in narrow fields of musical
scholarship to exist. Instead methodological cross-overs are the
norm. Among all the different approaches there was a common
denominator that could be summed up by Dr. Funkamatic and Professor
Metatextual, and I let their words conclude this report:
<p> 

Dr. F: [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] my purpose has been to argue that musical imagery is
disseminated through an inherited syntax, sound bites, styles, idioms,
and many more such features. At any given moment, music has the force
to function as a powerful metaphor for creating countless dimensions
of experience. [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] Music is not just constructed from a jig-saw of
disparate musemes which we can fit together semiotically to disclose
some hidden meaning. [<nobr> . . . </nobr>] I must concur with the idea that as
musicologists it&rsquo;s time we also started analysing the ways in which
music affects us as individuals in order to search beyond the
formalist details of notation and transcription. To begin to
understand how music works on a social and cultural level, I need to
first and foremost find out how it influences me, how it constructs my
attitudes, and how it functions as part of the way in which we
experience our own bodies and identities.
<p> 

Prof. M:<nobr> . . . </nobr>and of course how we also escape from our identities and
bodies through the fantasy of musical experience!</p>
