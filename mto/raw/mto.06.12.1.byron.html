<i>Pierrot lunaire</i> open a window into the workshop of Arnold Schoenberg (the 
conductor) and Erika Stiedry-Wagner (who performed the <i>Sprechstimme</i>). 
These recordings reveal that in a period of not more than three days, Schoenberg 
accepted relatively great freedom in the <i>Sprechstimme</i> pitch contour; as well 
as a contradictory tendency towards consistency and a certain systematic 
approach towards pitch, which does not always adhere to the score. Before 
examining the recordings it was not possible to know whether the relation 
between the performed <i>Sprechstimme</i> and the score was controlled, systematic, 
or simply a matter of chance. The recordings shed new light on what has been 
described by Boulez, Stadlen and others as the &ldquo;<i>Sprechstimme</i> enigma:&rdquo; namely, 
how Schoenberg expected the <i>Sprechstimme</i> to be performed. The history of 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings on <i>Sprechstimme</i> demonstrates that his perception of it 
changed along with the development of his performance aesthetics in general. 
Based on evidence from the recordings as well as on recent performance studies 
theory, I will claim that the <i>Sprechstimme</i> enigma is greatly clarified when 
one understands that there are simultaneously two types of notation in <i>Pierrot 
lunaire:</i> one for the instruments that tends towards a reproduction of a sound 
object, and another for the <i>Sprechstimme</i> which involves a process of greater 
real-time interaction between performer and score. Although the <i>Sprechstimme</i> 
from the workshop of Schoenberg and Stiedry-Wagner may be regarded as an extreme 
case study, it magnifies in a way what also happens in performances of other 
types of music.</font></p>

<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p><h3 align="left">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="left">[1.1] In his 2005 article &ldquo;Schoenberg as performer of his own 
works&rdquo; Ronald Jackson speculated that it &ldquo;is unfortunate that we have only one 
version of each of Schoenberg&rsquo;s recorded works. Had he left more than one, how 
much more we would know about the kinds of freedoms he would have condemned or 
favored.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> 
Indeed the well documented 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/schoenberg/as_disco/shoaf.htm">web-site of Wayne Shoaf</a> does not mention more than 
one recording of the very few that exist with Schoenberg conducting; the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.schoenberg.at/">Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg Center web site</a> has some further information but here too one can find 
only a single recording of each composition. Recently, I discovered several 
further recordings of Schoenberg conducting <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>. The first is a 
recording of a broadcast from 17 November 1940 in New York. The second is the 
test pressings of the 1940 commercial recording. The broadcast does not appear 
in any catalogue. The test pressings appear in a printed catalogue from 1986, 
yet they lay dormant for 65 years in Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Nachla&szlig;</i> since only now they 
were transferred in a very delicate and expensive process from LPs to CDs.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> 
In this article I will focus on the test pressings.<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup></p>

<p>[1.2] <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> is considered by many as Schoenberg&rsquo;s most famous 
masterpiece. For a long time the 1940 recording of Schoenberg conducting the 
piece was the only commercial recording available of his mature music.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup></a> 
Referring to it in a letter from 30 September 1940 to Moses Smith, Schoenberg 
claimed to be &ldquo;very happy about the records.&rdquo; The test pressings for the 
recording were made between 24 and 26 September 1940 in Los Angeles, in which 
the following musicians participated: Erika Stiedry-Wagner, recitation; Rudolf 
Kolisch, violin and viola; Stefan Auber, cello; Edward Steuermann, piano; 
Leonard Posella, flute and piccolo; and Kalman Bloch, clarinet and bass 
clarinet.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[1.3] After the different test pressings were recorded they were given to 
Schoenberg to choose the best ones for the published recording. Dika Newlin, a 
student of Schoenberg, wrote on 2 October 1940 that Schoenberg had two or three 
test pressings of each side of the records. He wanted some &ldquo;outsiders who were 
not quite as familiar with the music&rdquo; to help him choose the best test pressing 
of each song. She reported that &ldquo;Estep, Stein [other students of Schoenberg] and 
I were the only outside people there&mdash; Otherwise, there were performers and 
family: Kolisch with wife, Auber, Posella, Khuner, and Mrs. Seligmann.&rdquo; Newlin 
claimed: &ldquo;I vigorously participated in selecting the test pressings, a rather 
trickish job, since in many cases the differences were slight yet important.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[1.4] The test pressings include 16 records recorded on one side at 78 speed. 
These are not simply different performances. If up to now we had only a single 
picture of a historical event of Schoenberg conducting Schoenberg, now we have 
several pictures, or as it were&mdash;a short film of the very same occasion. This 
grants a rare opportunity to enter the workshop of the artist and observe not 
only the final product, but also the process of creation. It also provides a new 
perspective on the degree of stability and change of this historical 
interpretation.</p>

<div style="width:400px;float:right;border:none;margin-left:30px"><br>
                <p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><b>Table 1</b>. List of test pressings (for songs with more than one test pressing)</p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-bottom:0em"><a class='youtube'  target="blank" href="byron_examples.php?id=0&nonav=true"><img border="1" alt="Table 1 thumbnail" src="byron_tab1_small.png"></a></p><p class='fullwidth' style="text-align: center; margin-top:0em"><font size="2">(click to enlarge)</font></p></div>

<p>[1.5] There are 34 test pressings (see <b>Table 1</b>). The songs &ldquo;Eine blasse 
W&auml;scherin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Valse de Chopin,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Madonna&rdquo; were recorded four times; &ldquo;Gebet an 
Pierrot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Raub,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rote Messe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Galgenlied&rdquo; were recorded three times. &ldquo;Mondestrunken,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Colombine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Der Dandy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Enthauptung,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Die Kreuze&rdquo; were recorded twice; 
all the remaining nine songs were recorded once (not included in Table 1).</p>
<p align="left">[1.6] One of the curiosities of Op. 21 is the <i>Sprechstimme</i>; and it is 
especially interesting when examining the singing of Erika Stiedry-Wagner in the 
recording with Schoenberg conducting. In this study I will focus mainly on 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> in the song &ldquo;Eine blasse W&auml;scherin.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup> 
Many commentators have 
noted that Stiedry-Wagner sings with an inaccurate pitch.<sup><a name="FN8REF" href="#FN8" id="footnote8">(8)</a></sup> 
In Western art 
music, singing in a pitch that is inaccurate to some extent is not uncommon, yet 
in the performance of Stiedry-Wagner this is done in an explicit and exceptional 
manner. I will examine not only how accurately Stiedry-Wagner sings the pitches 
in &ldquo;Eine blasse W&auml;scherin,&rdquo; but also whether or not deviations are consistent in 
the four test pressings. If consistency may be found, it is interesting to 
consider its extent and whether it has greater implications on the understanding 
of how Schoenberg expected the <i>Sprechstimme</i> to be performed, and how Stiedry-Wagner 
built her performance? Finally, I suggest that a reconsideration of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> in light of the test pressings has larger implications for 
understanding the role of the performer in relation to the score of many other 
musical works that were influenced by <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> or which influenced its 
creation, as well as of other works in Western art music. </p>
<h3>THE <i>SPRECHSTIMME</i> ENIGMA</h3>
<p>[2.1] David Hamilton has claimed that Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> &ldquo;has been 
enormously influential in breaking the virtual stranglehold the bel-canto model 
of vocal production had maintained on Western Music&mdash; the vocal writing of 
Boulez, Crumb, Berio, and Maxwell Davis, for example, is unthinkable without <i>Pierrot&rsquo;s</i> 
rupture of that fruitful but necessarily limiting monopoly.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN9REF" href="#FN9" id="footnote9">(9)</a></sup> 
The 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> technique used by the speaker in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, as well as in 
other works by Schoenberg, has been described as posing &ldquo;an enduring and perhaps 
insoluble interpretive enigma for the performer.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN10REF" href="#FN10" id="footnote10">(10)</a></sup> 
Both Darius Milhaud and 
Pierre Boulez, who conducted the piece, described it as creating &ldquo;insoluble 
problems.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN11REF" href="#FN11" id="footnote11">(11)</a></sup> 
Boulez claimed that &ldquo;although we possess authentic documentation 
on the subject, it is still difficult to form any precise idea of <i>Sprechgesang</i>.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN12REF" href="#FN12" id="footnote12">(12)</a></sup> 
Lorraine Gorrell, who has performed the speaker&rsquo;s role in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, 
reported the puzzling situation she found herself in when she approached the 
work. When listening to different recordings she discovered that &ldquo;one performer 
sang the voice part, duplicating the pitches indicated in the score, while 
several other singers spoke the part but only vaguely approximated the indicated 
pitches.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN13REF" href="#FN13" id="footnote13">(13)</a></sup> 
The recording of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> made by Schoenberg also did not 
solve this problem since Stiedry-Wagner &ldquo;did not match pitches or observe the 
indicated intervallic relationships. In fact, she sometimes did not even follow 
the direction of the indicated pitches. I began to wonder why Schoenberg had 
given pitches at all.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN14REF" href="#FN14" id="footnote14">(14)</a></sup> 
A sense of the difficulty of performing <i>Sprechstimme</i> can be gained from the following report. Stiedry-Wagner said that 
Schoenberg and other members of the <i>Society for Private Musical Performance</i></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>wanted first Gutheil-Schoder to [sing <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>]<nobr>. . .</nobr> But it is a thing you 
have to talk, to speak, not to sing. And so she found it <nobr>. . .</nobr> too difficult, and 
then Alban said, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Erika Wagner? She&rsquo;s an actress and she&rsquo;s a 
singer,&rdquo; because I also sang. I had <i>Liederabende</i> and I sang operettas. And so 
it happened that I did <i>Pierrot</i>. I studied it with Erwin Stein<nobr>. . .</nobr> I was working 
very hard, oh very hard. Because you know it&rsquo;s very difficult to speak in rhythm&mdash;strong rhythm. And then the <i>Sprechmelodie</i>, you know<nobr>. . .</nobr> He wants a certain line 
to speak, with low tones and with high tones, and it is very difficult to keep 
the tone if you have to speak a word through one whole measure&mdash;a long time. 
It&rsquo;s very difficult to keep it without singing<nobr>. . .</nobr> you need a very, very big <i>Skala</i>&mdash;deep and high and you have to be a <i>Sprecher</i>&mdash;you have to know how to speak, 
not how to sing, and that&rsquo;s the main thing. And it&rsquo;s very wrong&mdash;Schoenberg 
always told me it&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;to sing<nobr>. . .</nobr> And this is really very difficult. So it 
was a <i>Spezialit&auml;t</i>&mdash;a specialty for me.<sup><a name="FN15REF" href="#FN15" id="footnote15">(15)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In several recordings&mdash;for example, one by Pierre Boulez and Yvonne Minton from 
1977&mdash;one can hear a precise production of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> pitches indicated 
in the score, which Minton sings.<sup><a name="FN16REF" href="#FN16" id="footnote16">(16)</a></sup> 
A performance decision which closely 
observes the pitch is not without sense since many of the songs contain 
significant pitch relationships between the <i>Sprechstimme</i> and the instruments. 
For example, in &ldquo;Parodie&rdquo; there are canons between voice and viola and 
between voice and piccolo. Yet &ldquo;failing&rdquo; to observe the indicated pitch is not 
only the practice of Stiedry-Wagner but also that of many other speakers.<sup><a name="FN17REF" href="#FN17" id="footnote17">(17)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.2] Further problems were mentioned by Boulez when he wrote that there are 
&ldquo;people the tessitura of whose singing voice is wider and higher than that of 
their speaking voice,&rdquo; while with others the opposite may occur. He concludes 
that <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> &ldquo;is thus both too high and too low.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN18REF" href="#FN18" id="footnote18">(18)</a></sup> 
Also he pointed to the fact the when one speaks, the duration of the sound is 
usually short.<sup><a name="FN19REF" href="#FN19" id="footnote19">(19)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.3] There have been several attempts to solve the <i>Sprechstimme</i> enigma. Peter 
Stadlen&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Schoenberg&rsquo;s Speech-Song&rdquo; from 1981 is a classic in the 
literature on <i>Sprechstimme</i>.<sup><a name="FN20REF" href="#FN20" id="footnote20">(20)</a></sup> Yet this article has several weaknesses. 
First, it contains an implicit assumption that the performance of <i>Sprechstimme</i> 
should be identical or at least similar in all of Schoenberg&rsquo;s compositions. Yet 
Schoenberg imagined different kinds of <i>Sprechstimme</i> in different periods and 
for different compositions; for example, in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> he wanted the 
adherence to pitch to be greater than that in the <i>Gurrelieder</i>.<sup><a name="FN21REF" href="#FN21" id="footnote21">(21)</a></sup> Stadlen&rsquo;s 
article reviews what it sees as Schoenberg&rsquo;s contradictory attitudes to 
<i>Sprechstimme</i>, with no relation to the contexts of his different performance 
aesthetics. Demonstrating how Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings on <i>Sprechstimme</i> can be 
more fully understood in the light of his changing performance aesthetics is 
beyond the scope of this article, yet I will point to significant moments of 
change. Most importantly, I claim that this so-called contradiction appears only 
if one understands the role of the singer as that of reproducing the score or a 
sound object. My study will reveal that it is not that Schoenberg simply 
tolerated <i>Sprechstimme</i> performances that were not faithful to the score, but 
that he did not expect an exact reproduction of a sound <i>object</i> (at least with 
regard of the pitch parameter) from Stiedry-Wagner. We will see that 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s acceptance of Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;out-of-tune&rdquo; <i>Sprechstimme</i> was not 
due to limited musicality (she was after all more an actress than a singer), but 
something that was part of the conception of the piece. At the end of this 
article I will offer an alternative view to the role of the singer in <i>Pierrot 
lunaire</i> which much clarifies this so-called contradiction. In order to explain 
the contradiction that Stadlen wrote about I will further review the history of 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i>. </p>

<p>[2.4] The origin of this technique has been traced to Engelbert Humperdinck in 
his 1897 melodrama <i>K&ouml;nigskinder</i>, as well as to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; Austrian theater 
speaking, yet Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> is a fresh and new conception.<sup><a name="FN22REF" href="#FN22" id="footnote22">(22)</a></sup>  
Richard Kurth argues that &ldquo;Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> is a <i>representation</i> of 
speech and a <i>substitute</i> for both speech and song. It emphasizes its own 
peculiarity and disorients the listener&rsquo;s customary response to words&rsquo; sound and 
meaning.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN23REF" href="#FN23" id="footnote23">(23)</a></sup> Schoenberg was influenced by Albertine Zehme&rsquo;s original conception 
of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, and it is not unlikely that he was also influenced by her 
conception of recitation.<sup><a name="FN24REF" href="#FN24" id="footnote24">(24)</a></sup> Zehme, who was deeply interested in the artistic 
and mystical sides of recitation, was the author of a treatise on the subject 
named <i>Die Grundlagen des k&uuml;nstlerischen Sprechens und Singens</i> from 1920.<sup><a name="FN25REF" href="#FN25" id="footnote25">(25)</a></sup>  
In a note entitled &ldquo;Why I must speak these songs&rdquo; which she attached to one of 
her March 1911 Berlin performances, she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words that we speak should not solely lead to mental concepts, but instead 
their sound should allow us to partake of their inner experience. To make this 
possible we must have an unconstrained freedom of tone. None of the thousand 
vibrations should be denied to the expression of feeling. I demand tonal 
freedom, not thoughts!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The singing voice, that supernatural, chastely controlled instrument, ideally 
beautiful precisely in its ascetic lack of freedom, is not suited to strong 
eruptions of feeling&mdash;since even one strong breath of air can spoil its 
incomparable beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life cannot be exhausted by the beautiful sound alone. The deepest final 
happiness, the deepest final sorrow dies away unheard, as a silent scream within 
our breast, which threatens to fly apart or to erupt like a stream of molten 
lava from our lips. For the expression of these final things it seems to me 
almost cruel to expect the singing voice to do such a labor, from which it must 
go fourth frayed, splintered, and tattered.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our poets and composers to communicate, we need both the tones of 
	song as well as those of speech. My unceasing striving in search of the 
	ultimate expressive capabilities for the &ldquo;artistic experience of tone&rdquo; has 
	taught me this fact.<sup><a name="FN26REF" href="#FN26" id="footnote26">(26)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;unconstrained&rdquo; expressive conception of the role of the voice, which 
expresses something that is more than &ldquo;the beautiful sound alone,&rdquo; will be one 
of the keys to understanding Schoenberg&rsquo;s puzzling concept of <i>Sprechstimme</i>.</p>

<p>[2.5] On a page from a working autograph of <i>Die gl&uuml;ckliche Hand</i>, Op. 18 from 
September 1910 Schoenberg explained that the notes with crossed stems &ldquo;must be 
spoken at exactly the prescribed time and sustained as indicated; the pitch is 
to be realized approximately through speech.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN27REF" href="#FN27" id="footnote27">(27)</a></sup>  
The first (complete) 
manuscript of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> had no preface, yet on the page of &ldquo;Gebet an 
Pierrot&rdquo; (which was the first song to be composed in the cycle) from about March 
1912 Schoenberg wrote: &ldquo;The recitation should hint at the pitch.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN28REF" href="#FN28" id="footnote28">(28)</a></sup>  
In a 
letter to Berg from 14 January 1913 Schoenberg wrote: &ldquo;Regarding the melodramas 
in the <i>Gurrelieder</i>: the pitch notation is certainly not to be taken as 
seriously as in the <i>Pierrot</i> melodramas. The result here should by no means be 
such a songlike <i>Sprechmelodie</i> as in the latter<nobr>. . .</nobr> [There is] no [need to keep 
the] <nobr>. . .</nobr> interval proportions!.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN29REF" href="#FN29" id="footnote29">(29)</a></sup>  
The idea of keeping the interval proportions 
(and not the exact notated pitch) in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> is manifested in an early 
version of the famous preface to the piece. It can be found in a collection of 
manuscripts which were written between March 1912 and January 1914.<sup><a name="FN30REF" href="#FN30" id="footnote30">(30)</a></sup>  
Here we 
find a different version of the text: &ldquo;it is the duty of the performer to 
perform the rhythm absolutely precisely, and to transform the notated melody 
into a <i>Sprechmelodie</i> by always keeping the <i>relationship</i><sup><a name="FN31REF" href="#FN31" id="footnote31">(31)</a></sup> 
between the pitches.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN32REF" href="#FN32" id="footnote32">(32)</a></sup> The same concept is also expressed several years later, on 13 
January 1921, in a letter Erwin Stein wrote to Schoenberg: &lsquo;It is really 
unbelievable, how clear the expression, and also its intensity, is fixed with 
the [notated] speech intervals. When one speaks what is [notated] there, one 
understands the expression, even if one did not feel it at first. Although the 
register differences [Lagenunterschiede] and the proportions of the intervals 
are very important&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN33REF" href="#FN33" id="footnote33">(33)</a></sup>  
This letter reveals that even members of Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
circle were not completely sure about the performative status of the notated 
pitch. If it were clear that the 1914 preface demands an exact reproduction of 
notated pitch, then Stein would not seek the confirmation of &lsquo;the master&rsquo; 
concerning the superiority of interval proportions in relation to exact pitch. 
On 8 July 1923 Schoenberg himself confirmed this when he wrote to Josef Rufer:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The pitches in Pierrot depend on the range of the voice. You have to consider 
them &lsquo;well&rsquo; but not &lsquo;strictly&rsquo;. You can divide the range of the voice in as many 
parts as half tones are used; perhaps then every distance is just a 3/4 tone. 
But you don&rsquo;t have to carry this out in a pedantic way, because the pitches do 
not realize harmonical proportions. Of course the range of the speaking voice is 
not enough. Well, the lady has to learn to speak with &lsquo;head voice&rsquo;; every voice 
can do that<nobr>. . .</nobr> The most important thing is to get the &lsquo;Sprechmelodie&rsquo;.<sup><a name="FN34REF" href="#FN34" id="footnote34">(34)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following suggestion by Erwin Stein, which appeared in an article in the 
journal <i>Pult und Taktstock</i> in 1927, seems to correspond to the indication in the 
early preface (and not the one that appeared in the published score) and these 
letters:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Though shown in absolute pitch notation, the intervals are only meant to be 
relative. The initial note is so short that it is of no harmonic consequence. 
The reciter is therefore free not only to transpose his part according to the 
	type of his speaking voice and regardless of the other instruments, but also 
	to narrow down the compass and tessitura<nobr>. . .</nobr> What is essential is that the 
	proportions of the melodic line be retained: a high note has to be 
	relatively high, a low note relatively low; a fourth must be a wider leap 
	than a third, and a minor second a smaller step than a major second.<sup><a name="FN35REF" href="#FN35" id="footnote35">(35)</a></sup>	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On 13 May 1927 Schoenberg wrote to Stein from Berlin that this article was 
&lsquo;an excellent article, full of clarity, intelligence and understanding.&rsquo;<sup><a name="FN36REF" href="#FN36" id="footnote36">(36)</a></sup><br>
<br>[2.6] Yet a very different conception of <i>Sprechstimme</i> can be found in the 1914 
preface that Schoenberg wrote to the first printed edition of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The melody indicated by notes in the part of the speaker (with certain specially 
indicated exceptions) is <i>not</i> intended to be sung. The performer has the task 
of transforming it into a <i>speech melody</i> by taking well into consideration the 
indicated pitches. He can do this by<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I. keeping to the rhythm just as precisely as he would when singing, i.e., with 
no more freedom than he would take in a sung melody;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; II. being quite conscious of the difference between a 
	<i>sung tone</i> and a <i>spoken 
tone</i>: the sung tone maintains its pitch without change, the spoken tone 
touches upon it but then leaves it immediately by descending or ascending. The 
performer must always be on guard against falling into a &ldquo;singing&rdquo; manner of 
speech. That is absolutely not intended. But neither should he aim for a 
realistic-natural speech. Quite the opposite, there should always be a clear 
difference between customary speech and speech that contributes to a musical 
effect. But this should never remind one of song.<sup><a name="FN37REF" href="#FN37" id="footnote37">(37)</a></sup>	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The demand for &ldquo;taking well into consideration the indicated pitches&rdquo; seems to 
contradict the mentioned above conceptions of approximation and suggestiveness 
of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> in relation to the notated pitch. Stadlen suggests there 
was &ldquo;a conflict, from the very beginning, in Schoenberg&rsquo;s mind between a desire 
for speech character and another, seemingly incompatible desire for an exact 
rendering of the notes.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN38REF" href="#FN38" id="footnote38">(38)</a></sup> However, this is only a restatement of the problem 
and not its solution. </p>

<p>[2.7] There is something strange in Schoenberg&rsquo;s instructions in this version of 
the preface: how can the &ldquo;indicated pitch&rdquo; be communicated if one must 
immediately deviate from it? Schoenberg&rsquo;s demand for the speaker to perform her 
part in a manner which is neither singing nor normal speaking leaves the 
performer in a state where clear performance instructions are not to be found. 
This places considerable responsibility on the performer&mdash;a responsibility that 
may lead to unpredictable results. Indeed, the many recordings of this piece 
demonstrate the diversity of the interpretations of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> part that 
have been made up to now.<sup><a name="FN39REF" href="#FN39" id="footnote39">(39)</a></sup> Richard Kurth writes: &ldquo;At once both speech and 
song, <i>Sprechstimme</i> is also neither<nobr>. . .</nobr> Its exact rhythms, its sometimes 
purposefully uncoordinated placement of stress, and its exaggerated contours 
lend <i>Sprechstimme</i> an unnatural air which is modern in its artificiality, and 
which recalls the strange poses of the miming Pierrot<nobr>. . .</nobr> A stimulated, exaggerated 
form of recitation, it distorts the sounds of normal spoken language and 
alienates them; but at the same time, it also augments the mimetic potential of 
words by (re)presenting their sounds and rhythms in an altered (and heightened) 
form.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN40REF" href="#FN40" id="footnote40">(40)</a></sup> Perhaps this is also one of the reasons that <i>Sprechstimme</i> 
has invited not only a large variety of performative interpretations, but also 
very different responses by listeners.<sup><a name="FN41REF" href="#FN41" id="footnote41">(41)</a></sup></p>

<p>[2.8] On 16 August 1922, Schoenberg wrote to the singer Marya Freund concerning
<i>Pierrot lunaire</i>: &ldquo;I am anxious to explain to you why I cannot allow any will 
but mine to prevail in realizing [<i>dargestellten</i>] the musical thoughts 
[<i>musikalischen Gedanken</i>] that I have recorded on paper, and why realizing them 
must be done in such deadly earnest, with such inexorable severity, because the 
composing was done just that way.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN42REF" href="#FN42" id="footnote42">(42)</a></sup> The reason for this severity, as well as 
for the relatively great silence by Schoenberg during the 1920s on the issue of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i>, might be that he was too influenced by and aware of the 
anti-interpretation movements of the 1920s, such as the <i>Neue Sachlichkeit</i>, to 
correspond on a matter which grants the performer such great freedom from the 
score. Several of Schoenberg&rsquo;s writings contain complaints about performers in 
the 1920s who interpreted the score too freely;<sup><a name="FN43REF" href="#FN43" id="footnote43">(43)</a></sup> the concept of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> as it appears in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> demands respect for the score 
on the one hand, while also requiring a freedom of interpretation on the part of 
the speaker, something which to Stadlen seemed contradictory. Yet what exactly 
needs to be realized here? What exactly are these musical thoughts? I believe 
that it is clear neither from this letter nor from other evidence that 
reproduction of pitch is the main issue (note that Schoenberg had put emphasis 
here on the severity of the <i>process</i> of composing). </p>

<p>[2.9] Christian Schmidt quotes the following passage from Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
instructions in <i>Moses und Aron</i>: &ldquo;The musician often cannot refrain also from 
melodically notating these mere speech figures. But also these are not to be 
sung. Evidence: they are beyond the 12 tones! But perhaps the singer should 
extract out of the [melodic] line what expression to conceive.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN44REF" href="#FN44" id="footnote44">(44)</a></sup> Also Edward Steuermann, Schoenberg&rsquo;s disciple and the pianist who performed 
<i>Pierrot 
lunaire</i> since its beginning, claimed: &ldquo;It seems to me one has to find the 
expression of each sentence that will cover an entire line.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN45REF" href="#FN45" id="footnote45">(45)</a></sup> Schmidt asks 
whether the <i>Sprechstimme</i> notated is &ldquo;music-for-the-eyes&rdquo; (Augen-musik) and if 
it was notated only because the composer could not release himself from the 
responsibility of relating to harmonic, counterpoint, and motivic-thematic 
ideas?<sup><a name="FN46REF" href="#FN46" id="footnote46">(46)</a></sup> Schmidt does not 
answer his question but rather claims: &ldquo;Doubt is advisable, and will arguably 
also remain.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN47REF" href="#FN47" id="footnote47">(47)</a></sup> </p>

<p>[2.10] A different attitude than in the 1920s can be found in the last decade or 
so of Schoenberg&rsquo;s life. On 31 August 1940 he wrote to the Stiedrys: &ldquo;We must 
<nobr>. . .</nobr> refresh the <i>Sprechstimme</i> thoroughly&mdash;at least, because I aim this time to 
try to bring out this light, ironical-satiric tone <nobr>. . .</nobr> in which this composition 
was originally conceived. Furthermore, times and aesthetic concepts are 
changing, so what at the time seemed to us Wagnerian, or in the worst case Tchaikovskian, today is, for example, Puccini, Lehar and so on.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN48REF" href="#FN48" id="footnote48">(48)</a></sup>  
Notwithstanding the ironic tone of the second sentence, one should not discount 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s intention to create a new kind of <i>Sprechstimme</i>. </p>

<p>[2.11] In 1949 Schoenberg wrote in &ldquo;This is my Fault&rdquo; as follows:<blockquote>
	<p>In the preface to <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> I had demanded that performers 
ought not to add illustrations and moods of their own derived from the text. In 
the epoch after the First World War, it was customary for composers to surpass 
me radically, even if they did not like my music. Thus when I had asked not to 
add external expression and illustration, they understood that expression and 
illustration were out, and that there should be no relation whatsoever to the 
text. There were now composed songs, ballets, operas and oratorios in which the 
achievement of the composer consisted in a strict aversion against all that his 
text presented.<sup><a name="FN49REF" href="#FN49" id="footnote49">(49)</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed we will see that in the recording from 1940 Schoenberg allowed 
Stiedry-Wagner to make unnotated changes in her <i>Sprechstimme</i> that have a 
direct correlation to the mood and character of the text. In other words, the 
indication from the preface of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> should be understood in its 
historical context and not necessarily as the definitive, or most significant, 
wish of the composer. </p>

<p>[2.12] In a letter to the conductor Hans Rosbaud from 15 February 1949 
Schoenberg claimed that the speaker in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> &ldquo;never sings the theme, 
but, at most, speaks against it, while the themes (and everything else of 
musical importance) happen in the instruments.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN50REF" href="#FN50" id="footnote50">(50)</a></sup> Likewise, in a letter to 
Daniel Ruyneman from 29 July 1949 concerning <i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, Schoenberg wrote 
that &ldquo;none of these poems is determined to be sung, but rather they must be 
spoken without fixed pitch.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN51REF" href="#FN51" id="footnote51">(51)</a></sup> In these two cases Schoenberg emphasized the 
speaking side of <i>Sprechstimme</i>. Such an emphasis may have resulted from 
performers he had heard who simply sang the part. However negative performance 
experiences may not have been the only issue here at hand. Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
performance aesthetics of that time did not advocate interpretations that negate 
the performer&rsquo;s capacity to express him- or herself in ways that deviate from 
the strict indications of the score.<sup><a name="FN52REF" href="#FN52" id="footnote52">(52)</a></sup> <i>Sprechstimme</i> in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> has 
an in-built demand for interpretation by the performer; and when this is denied 
by performers, Schoenberg saw it as a misinterpretation of his music. </p>

<p>[2.13] On 2 January 1951 Schoenberg wrote to the Stiedrys that in contrast with
<i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, the <i>Sprechstimme</i> in the melodrama of the <i>Gurrelieder</i> 
should relate &ldquo;in no manner [to] pitches.&rdquo; Schoenberg stressed: &ldquo;I believe that 
I have written them only in order to represent my phrasing of the notes, the 
accentuation and the recitation more urgently. Therefore please no 
speech-melodies.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN53REF" href="#FN53" id="footnote53">(53)</a></sup> This demonstrates that Schoenberg used the conventional 
notation of pitches in a non-conventional manner. Although he expected greater 
fidelity to pitch in the <i>Sprechstimme</i> of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> than in that of the 
<i>Gurrelieder</i>, this does not mean that in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> the performer should 
simply reproduce pitch. The fact that one can find structures in the pitch 
contour of the speaker&rsquo;s part which are identical to those of the instruments 
and which correspond to similar compositional techniques, does not necessarily 
mean that these should be &ldquo;brought out&rdquo; in performance. Perhaps also in this 
case (as in <i>Moses und Aron</i>) the relations in the score are more part of 
the compositional process, and not necessarily to be communicated by performers 
and perceived by listeners.<sup><a name="FN54REF" href="#FN54" id="footnote54">(54)</a></sup></p>


<p>[2.14] The change in conception of the 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> in Schoenberg&rsquo;s last 
decade or so of his life is also revealed in his new way of notating it in works 
such as <i>Ode to Napoleon</i> (1942), <i>A Survivor from Warsaw</i> (1947) and 
<i>Modern 
Psalm</i> (1950), where he used a single line (instead of five) for notating the 
approximate pitch of the speaker (see <b>Example 1</b>, 
<b>Example 2</b>, 
<b>Example 3</b>, 
and <b>Example 4</b>. In these works the speaker (or reciter, or narrator) is arguably discouraged from singing (compared to
<i>Pierrot 
lunaire</i>). The fact that Schoenberg also used accidentals in this late type of 
notation may seem contradictory, yet this paradoxical situation seems to support 
his call for performers not to read his notation of <i>Sprechstimme</i> at face 
value. Similarly, Stadlen writes about the fact that in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> one 
can find <i>Sprechstimme</i> notes with and without note heads (see <b>Example 5</b>). He 
concludes from this that the notes with heads should be sung at the given pitch. 
I would like to suggest that it is also possible that Schoenberg intended to 
grant the performers different levels of freedom where the notes without heads 
should be sung in an even freer manner than the notes with note heads. In other 
words, the fact that there are different types of notation here does not mean 
that notes with note heads must be sung in exact pitch. It is possible, again, 
that Schoenberg intended here three levels of interpretation: 1) notation of the 
instruments which should be precise with relation to pitch; 2) notation of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> with note heads which may be less precise; and 3) notation of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> without heads which grants the speaker even more freedom in 
determining the pitch.</p>
<h3>ANALYSIS OF THE TEST PRESSINGS</h3>
<p>[3.1] I mentioned above Lorraine Gorrell&rsquo;s observation that Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s
<i>Sprechstimme</i> is off-pitch. This is something that one notices immediately when 
analyzing <i>Sprechstimme</i> pitch in the different test pressings. However, the 
test pressings reveal further interesting information. 
<b>Figure 1</b>, which 
covers measures 5&ndash;17 of &ldquo;Eine blasse W&auml;scherin,&rdquo; has the <i>Sprechstimme</i> at the upper 
stave and the pitches of the four test pressings on the four staves below it.</p>
<p>[3.2] I used the computer program &ldquo;gram&rdquo; to detect <i>Sprechstimme</i> pitch. This 
program creates a spectrogram as in <b>Figures 2</b> and <b>3</b>. The user of the program can 
position the cursor on the spectrogram and the pitch is given in Hertz values. 
In <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> in general, and in our recording in particular, there is a 
special problem in deciding where to position the cursor; since Stiedry-Wagner 
often glissandos (see  
<b>Figure 2</b>) after and/or before the notated pitch (or its 
equivalent in her singing). In several cases I determined the pitch according to 
the dynamics&mdash;a place with higher dynamics (marked with darker black in the 
spectrogram&mdash;see for example Figure 2) was most likely the pitch which she 
tried to reach; or according to an average pitch, for example, when there was 
vibrato. Although the pitches of the test pressings in  
Figure 1 should be 
understood as an approximation, the possible degree of mistake is not larger 
than a quarter-tone and my transcription in Figure 1 is, therefore, accurate. In 
very few cases was there doubt about the exact pitch (for example, because of 
the voice being overridden by the instruments); these places appear in Figure 1 
with a question mark. The duration, shown in  
<b>Figure 3</b>, was measured in relation
to the commencement of each word of the text.</p>
<p>[3.3] It seems that Stiedry-Wagner allowed herself to transpose the pitch, 
usually, a third or fourth lower. Yet the transposition is not done consistently 
within the different test pressings: if one compares the four test pressings in 
measures 5&ndash;6, one will notice that except for test pressings 1 and 3 in measure 5, which 
are almost identical, all the rest start at different pitches and move within 
the phrases in a manner which is very free compared with one another (hear   
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=6',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=6">Sound Examples 1&ndash;4</a>). A further comparison of these measures and others suggest that she 
did not have a strict idea of the intervallic content and the degree of 
transposition; and that much of this was improvised at that moment and changed 
from test pressing to test pressing. For example, the starts of the phrase in measure 
5 was transposed a minor third to a fifth lower (depending on the test 
pressing), while the phrase beginning at the middle of measure 7 starts in test 
pressings 1 and 3 at the very same note as indicated in the score (and in the 
other test pressings&mdash;transposed not more than a minor second away)! </p>

<p>[3.4] Sometimes the pitch content of the notated melody seems to be almost 
completely ignored: in the phrase starting at the middle of measure 9 one can see 
that except for the movement in spaces of seconds and of a prima, there is 
little resemblance between the test pressings. In test pressings 2 and 4 there 
is a repetition of a single pitch (in each case a different one), something 
which emphasizes the speech character, yet which was not indicated in the 
notation (hear    
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=7',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=7">Sound Examples 5&ndash;8</a>). Another example can be found in the middle of the phrase which crosses measures 
13&ndash;14: the last four notes of measure 13 are different than those indicated in the 
score: in that Stiedry-Wagner does not reach the low point that Schoenberg 
notated. Yet here also, one can find a high degree of consistency among the test 
pressings, despite the discrepancy with the score.</p>

<p>[3.5] The examples mentioned above demonstrate the variety and liveliness of the 
singing of Stiedry-Wagner. The following examples will show that this 
improvisatory character was accompanied with a contradictory tendency towards 
stability. The start and end of the first phrase (measures 5&ndash;6) are very similar: the 
first three notes of test pressings 1 and 3 as well as the last three notes of 
test pressings 1, 2 and 3 accordingly have almost identical pitches. In 
contrast, the start of the phrase is more similar to the score than the end of 
it: there is consistency among the different test pressings and a very close 
resemblance to the score (hear   
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=6',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=6">Sound Examples 1&ndash;4</a>). A similarity between the pitch of the test pressings and the score can be found 
also at the end of phrases (see the first note in measure 9) or at the start of 
phrases in many other places in the song: for example, the last two notes in measure 
14, which are indicated to be sung, contain pitches very similar (indeed almost 
identical in this context) to those indicated in the score. When the notated 
pitch is systematically observed by Stiedry-Wagner in several test pressings it 
proves that it was not done by chance. Many times the exact pitch is not kept 
but the intervallic content is observed: the last phrase in measure 10 and the first 
one in measures 11&ndash;12 observe (by large) the direction and the intervallic relations 
of the notated melody. Note that the transposed starting tones as well as the 
ending ones in measures 11&ndash;12 are again similar if not identical among the different 
test pressings.</p>

<p>[3.6] In several cases one is obliged to notice a simultaneous tendency of 
change and stability in single phrases. The last two notes of the first phrase 
of the song (first two notes in measure 7) start a gesture with a pitch that is close 
to that of the score (first note) and ends much lower than indicated; the singer 
ignored the last pitch of this phrase in favor of a heightened expression of the 
prolonged gesture. A similar phenomenon occurs in measure 15 where the last two notes 
are supposed to be performed as a step upwards of a diminished fourth, yet in 
practice all test pressings contain a step upwards which is greater than an 
octave. A greater &ldquo;exaggeration&rdquo; can be found in the last two notes of the next 
phrase in measure 16. </p>

<p>[3.7] The phrase starting at the middle of measure 8 and ending at the beginning of 
measure 9 approximately observes the pitch of the peak of the phrase and that which 
ends it, while the pitch starting this phrase is usually between a fourth and a 
fifth higher than indicated (hear    
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=7',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=7">Sound Examples 9&ndash;12</a>). The tendency to observe the pitch contour of phrase endings (in spite of variety 
in the body of the phrase) can also be found at the start of measure 10, and the end 
of measures 15 and 16. A tendency to observe phrase peaks can be found in measure 11 (see 
the high but especially the low point in the melody); and in measure 14 where she 
attempts (and usually succeeds in all test pressings) to reach the c'' twice 
(see   Figure 2,  Figure 1 measure 14 and hear     
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=9',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=9">Sound Examples 13&ndash;16</a>). In measure 10 the c'' which 
is the peak of that phrase is transposed equally in all test pressings to g'. In 
measure 11 the beginning of phrase is transposed in test pressings 2&ndash;4 about a major 
third lower. In short, this consistency is not by chance and is probably a 
result of the singer paying more attention to the starts and ends of phrases.
</p>

<p>[3.8] Most interesting are the places where there is consistency among the test 
pressings which is contradictory to the direction of the melody in the score. It 
is possible to see such a tendency in the last four notes of measure 6: at the word 
&ldquo;Nachtzeit&rdquo; she is consistent in singing the first pitch higher than in the 
previous word &ldquo;Zur&rdquo; and than going down; this is opposite to what is written in 
the score (see   Figure 3,  Figure 1 measure 6 and hear    
<a target="ex_window" onClick="newwindow('byron_examples.php?id=7',1400,800); return false;" href="byron_examples.php?id=7">Sound Examples 9&ndash;12</a>). See also the 4th and 5th notes of measure 12; the relation between the 3rd and 4th 
notes of measures 14 and 16. This suggests that at times Stiedry-Wagner was 
consistently performing a contour which was different from that in the score. 
The consistency of her interpretation reveals that it was not pure 
improvisation, and that this additional conscious or unconscious &ldquo;structure&rdquo; was 
probably defined before performing the test pressings in the studio. The 
performer&rsquo;s &ldquo;structure,&rdquo; which is sometimes in contrast with the pitch in the 
score, possibly fits the words better (at least from the point of view of the 
singer). We saw that many years before the recording took place she studied this 
composition with Erwin Stein, and that she remembered, even after so many years 
had passed, that she &ldquo;was working very hard, oh very hard;&rdquo; and that Schoenberg 
wrote to her just before the recording took place that they &ldquo;must <nobr>. . .</nobr> refresh 
the <i>Sprechstimme</i> thoroughly.&rdquo; The hard work in preparing the piece as well as 
the many performances done under Schoenberg&rsquo;s baton created this constant 
character which at times collides with the score and at other times corresponds 
with it. </p>

<p>[3.9] Another possible reason why Stiedry-Wagner &ldquo;was working very hard&rdquo; when 
preparing her interpretation was because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very difficult to speak in rhythm&mdash;strong rhythm,&rdquo; as she herself testified. I mentioned Schoenberg&rsquo;s early 
preface written some time between March 1912 and January 1914: &ldquo;it is the duty 
of the performer to perform the rhythm absolutely precisely;&rdquo; as well as his 
1914 preface arguing that the performer should keep &ldquo;the rhythm just as 
precisely as he would when singing, i.e., with no more freedom than 
Figure 3. This figure must be read with 
caution, since what on paper may seem to be sounds with different durations may 
be perceived in listening as identical. Above Figure 3 one can find the rhythmic 
values of the first phrase. It seems that the words affect not only the pitch 
contour, as described above, but also the rhythm of the phrase. For example, in 
test pressing 3 the rhythm indicated in the score of the word &ldquo;Nachtzeit&rdquo; is 
distorted when the &ldquo;Nacht-&rdquo; turns out to be shorter than notated. One perceives 
the syllables of this word as of equal length. We can see that both rhythm and 
pitch contour are in contradiction with the score indication in this place. 
However, rhythmic deviations are usually not significant or systematic. The 
great deviations in pitch are compensated for by a rather strict adherence to 
notated rhythm. By fixing one parameter (rhythm) and giving much more freedom to 
another (pitch), Schoenberg created a situation where there is a mutual creation 
of musical meaning on the parts of composer and performer.
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>[4.1] The contradiction that is mentioned by Boulez, Stadlen and many other 
authors results from the 1914 preface that demands &ldquo;taking well into 
consideration the 
indicated pitches&rdquo; on the one hand, and the practice of Stiedry-Wagner (under 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s conducting) not to do so on the other hand. Other evidence 
mentioned above, the claim that &ldquo;pitch notation&rdquo; should be taken seriously 
(1913), the early preface asking to keep &ldquo;the relationship between the pitches,&rdquo; 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s 1922 letter to Maria Freund, and finally, his very act of notating 
exact pitches, all contribute to the sense that <i>Sprechstimme</i> must involve some 
serious relation to the notated pitch. </p>

<p>[4.2] Yet, Schoenberg also crossed the stems of the notes and wrote as early as 
1912 that the &ldquo;recitation should <i>hint</i> at the pitch.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN55REF" href="#FN55" id="footnote55">(55)</a></sup> In <i>Moses und Aron</i> 
he points to the fact that <i>Sprechstimme</i> is beyond the twelve tones, and that 
the singer should extract from the notation the expression (as opposed to 
singing the exact pitches). If Boulez pointed out that themes in the voice part 
have relations to those in the instruments, Schoenberg, as if predicting this, 
claimed in 1949 that &ldquo;the themes (and everything else of musical importance) 
happen in the instruments.&rdquo; During the same year he even went so far as 
suggesting that <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> must be spoken &ldquo;without fixed pitch;&rdquo; and he 
developed in several late works a <i>Sprechstimme</i> with no conventional pitch 
notation. All this contributes to the feeling that the notated pitch is not to 
be observed strictly. </p>

<p>[4.3] It was well known that Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> invited diverging 
interpretations by various performers, that Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s interpretation did 
not strictly observe the indicated pitch and that Schoenberg accepted such 
interpretations. What was not known was the degree of freedom that Schoenberg 
granted Stiedry-Wagner: it was not known whether the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; pitches that she 
sang were done so by chance or on purpose; it was further not known whether the 
&ldquo;wrong&rdquo; pitches were completely experimental, or had some relation (even if 
remote) to the score. This study of the test pressings reveals that there is a 
high degree of consistency in Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s singing in several cases: some 
keep the exact pitch indicated in the score, some follow only the intervallic 
relations indicated in the score, and some do not observe the pitch melody of 
the score at all. The tendency to keep the pitch of the intervallic relations 
was especially prominent at melody peaks and phrase boundaries. The consistency 
among the test pressings was kept even when it was sometimes against the 
intervallic direction of the notated melody. One could never know whether 
Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s off-pitch <i>Sprechstimme</i> was based on a new score that she 
created or whether it was purely a real-time experimentation; the test 
pressings, however, show a degree of freedom as well as of systematic behavior, 
and reveal that while Stiedry-Wagner prepared her <i>Sprechstimme</i> in advance 
(hence some of the systematic features), she left many aspects of her 
performance to real-time interaction (hence the variety among the test 
pressings). </p>

<p>[4.4] Stiedry-Wagner did not have a strict approach to 
the observance of notated pitch. In some of her performances the pitch was 
carefully observed, while in others merely &ldquo;hinted&rdquo; at. This, and the fact that 
places that collide with the score are consistent, suggests that she was working 
consciously or unconsciously with a performative contour that does not 
correspond to or deviate entirely from that of the score. In other words, it 
seems that <i>Sprechstimme</i> is meant to be constructed and highly influenced by the process 
of building an interpretation by the performer. </p>

<p>[4.5] Albertine Zehme and Stiedry-Wagner were actors and not professional 
singers; although, Stiedry-Wagner could control pitch since she sang in <i>Liederabende</i> and operettas. Except for praising her publicly for her 
performance in the recording, Schoenberg constantly chose her again and again 
(under his baton, that of Erwin Stein and others) for more than twenty years. 
This would not have occurred if her off-pitch singing would have been seen as 
problematic in his view. Furthermore, there are two famous stories of Schoenberg&rsquo;s inability to recognize when a player used an instrument in a wrong 
transposition.<sup><a name="FN56REF" href="#FN56" id="footnote56">(56)</a></sup> These stories are far from being simple descriptions of 
reality of Schoenberg&rsquo;s ability to decipher pitch, since there is a heavy 
suspicion that these players were playing tricks on the composer; in addition, 
he may have been concentrating on other issues when conducting this extremely 
new music.<sup><a name="FN57REF" href="#FN57" id="footnote57">(57)</a></sup> In other words, the assumption of limited ability on the parts of 
Stiedry-Wagner and Schoenberg to control or decipher pitch does not explain the
<i>Sprechstimmee</i> phenomenon. </p>

<p>[4.6] Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> may be seen as a concept which resists the 
view of music as solely the composer&rsquo;s sound which needs to be reproduced by 
passive performers. I mentioned above Albertine Zehme&rsquo;s 1911 statement that 
words are not merely concepts to be reproduced, but rather they &ldquo;allow us to 
partake of their inner experience&rdquo; which is achieved by an unrestrained tone. 
She concluded that &ldquo;Life cannot be exhausted by the beautiful sound alone.&rdquo; And 
indeed, the revealed nature of the test pressings seem to suggest that <i>Sprechstimme</i> notation can be seen also &ldquo;as a stimulus to the performer to 
respond in a musically meaningful way,&rdquo; and not only as a tool for reproducing a 
sound object.<sup><a name="FN58REF" href="#FN58" id="footnote58">(58)</a></sup> As mentioned above, the test pressings include both elements 
which stay relatively stable among different test pressings, as well as changing 
elements which support the view that performance &ldquo;consists of an interpretive 
engagement with the notation <nobr>. . .</nobr> done in real-time, that has to be enacted afresh 
on each occasion.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN59REF" href="#FN59" id="footnote59">(59)</a></sup> Although these words were used by Nicholas Cook with 
reference to a more rhythmically complex composition by Bryn Harrison, <i>Pierrot 
lunaire</i> can be seen as a predecessor of this type of approach to notation. The 
delicate balance between the stable and dynamic elements should not be seen as a 
contradiction, pace Stadlen, Boulez and others, but as a source of strength. 
However illogical it may seem, <i>Sprechstimme</i> in <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> 
engages the performer in action which connects both composer and performer in a 
fresh, mutual act of creation. The singer Jane Manning had recently written: 
&ldquo;The very essence of this masterpiece seems to stem from the extent to which it 
allows for constant renewal and refreshment in the very act of performing it<nobr>. . .</nobr> 
This is surely why it remains a consistently fascinating and satisfying task for 
the vocal performer.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN60REF" href="#FN60" id="footnote60">(60)</a></sup></p>

<p>[4.7] In a conversation between Adorno and Boulez about
<i>Pierrot lunaire</i>, 
Boulez said:
<blockquote>
	<p>I heard beforehand a very curious statement: Leonard Stein from Los Angeles told 
me once that, for example, when they were first rehearsing the  <i>Ode to Napoleon</i> 
in Los Angeles, Schoenberg demonstrated a few passages himself, and it was 
completely different than notated, because for him the expression is in the end 
more important than the notation. For the author that is of course poss</li>ible. But if one stands before the score as an interpreter, one has to 
initially have respect for the text; for if one distances oneself too far from 
the text, then it is no longer necessary to have a score, and perhaps I am 
therefore stricter than Sch&ouml;nberg. (Boulez laughs)<sup><a name="FN61REF" href="#FN61" id="footnote61">(61)</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Boulez&rsquo;s preconception of respect to score that an interpreter must have (a 
&ldquo;respect&rdquo; that the composer himself did not seem to have) conveys a strong 
belief in the interpreter as a servant of the score that the creator (composer) 
communicates to the listener. If one takes seriously Schoenberg&rsquo;s 
interpretations of his own music, it may be concluded that a different approach 
should be conducted by the performer. Indeed, Boulez and Adorno understand the 
absurdity of this view in light of Schoenberg&rsquo;s practice and after Boulez laughs 
(at the end of the quotation above), Adorno answers: &lsquo;You are in this respect 
truly more papal than the pope&rsquo;. Boulez fails to see a middle way between 
adhering strictly to the score and not using it at all. </p>

<p>[4.8] If one understands the role of the performer as one of reproducing a sound 
object then Boulez and Stadlen are right in detecting a contradiction. However, 
the test pressings of <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> confirm that a perfect reproduction was 
not Schoenberg&rsquo;s intention. Indeed, some aspects of pitch stay stable, and the 
rhythm is reproduced quite closely; however, the test pressings also reveal 
something new: the many changing elements and in some cases, their systematic 
nature, prove that great real-time interaction was expected from the speaker. 
The contradiction disappears if one understands the role of pitch not as one of 
a perfect reproduction (neither of pitches, nor of intervals) but as one 
that involves interpretative interaction in real-time. The 1914 preface 
indication that the &ldquo;performer has the task of transforming it into a <i>speech 
melody</i> by taking well into consideration the indicated pitches&rdquo; should be understood, I 
suggest, as a process of translation of pitch as if into a different language. 
Put bluntly, this means that the resulting pitches  
might be very different from those in the score. We saw above that Richard Kurth 
argues that Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i> is a &ldquo;<i>substitute</i> for both speech and 
song.&rdquo; Also the other preface indication that &ldquo;the spoken tone touches upon it 
but then leaves it immediately by descending or ascending&rdquo; imply that an exact 
reproduction of the notated pitch (or intervals, or contour direction) is indeed 
not the main issue. The improvisatory yet systematic nature of the test 
pressings suggests that the &ldquo;taking well into consideration&rdquo; of pitch meant something 
different from reproducing exact pitch. What counts is not reproduction but a 
dramatic interpretive engagement with pitch, and more important with the text. 
In another place Stiedry-Wagner wrote that in performance with other singers 
sometimes people laugh, yet she argued that one must speak the part in a 
dramatic manner and that when she did so&mdash;no laughter was heard. Schoenberg 
wanted the speaker to carefully interact with the notated melody in a manner 
that will transform it; the aim of the hard work, mentioned above, that 
Stiedry-Wagner had done was not to reproduce the pitch but to transform it in a 
dramatic and improvisatory manner.</p>

<p>[4.9] The test pressings reveal what 
was previously almost unimaginable: Schoenberg accepted very different 
performances (although not completely different) of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> 
notation by Stiedry-Wagner in a period of not more than three days. It is not 
clear why Schoenberg decided to choose test pressing number 4 of the song for 
the commercial recording; the analysis of test pressings shows that faithfulness 
to the score was not a consideration since none of the test pressings is clearly 
preferable to others in this respect. </p>

<p>[4.10] It seems to me that in 
<i>Pierrot lunaire</i> there are actually <i>two</i> types 
of notations: one for the instruments which demands a relatively precise 
rendition of pitches; and one for the <i>Sprechstimme</i> which demands real-time 
interaction of the singer with the notation which creates a much higher degree 
of unexpected results. The fact that there are pitch structures in the 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> melody that have relation to the melodies in the instruments does 
not necessarily mean that these should always be &ldquo;brought out&rdquo; in performance. 
After all, compositional constructions that helped or fascinated composers in 
the process of composing&mdash;features that appear in the score yet are not 
necessarily to be perceived by listeners, is not an uncommon phenomenon in the 
history of music. </p>

<p>[4.11] <i>Sprechstimme</i> is indeed a bizarre phenomenon in traditional classical 
singing. Nevertheless, in many ways it magnifies what happens also in more 
conventional singing. Deviation from notated pitch, as well as a certain 
creative and systematic approach which refuses to be reduced to score 
indications, is frequent in many types of singing. In this sense it is possible 
to speak of a singer&rsquo;s contour as a source which may have not less authority 
than what is traditionally known in music analysis as &lsquo;the structure&rsquo; or &lsquo;the 
melody&rsquo; notated in the score. This is of course valid also for much music of the 
twentieth century which includes singing techniques influenced directly or 
indirectly by Schoenberg&rsquo;s <i>Sprechstimme</i>. </p>

<p>[4.12] The history of Schoenberg&rsquo;s conception of 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> proves that he 
understood it differently in different periods. Schoenberg/Stiedry-Wagner&rsquo;s 1940 
workshop is after all only one historical occasion. Schoenberg was dealing with 
a particular performer, in a particular setting, and these constraints are 
perhaps somewhat contingent. Nevertheless, if one examines <i>Sprechstimme</i> 
history as well as the test pressings of the 1940 recordings, it is hard to 
avoid the notion that in spite the changes in conception, Schoenberg did expect 
that the singer will be always on a continuum (to use a metaphor coined by Cook)&mdash;more on the side of 
<i>interacting</i> with the score, and that the instruments 
will be more on the side of <i>reproducing</i> a sound object.<sup><a name="FN62REF" href="#FN62" id="footnote62">(62)</a></sup> In this sense, the 
shifting and contextualized picture of <i>Sprechstimme</i> which I presented above 
does not contradict the larger context, namely that of an 
<i>interaction</i>-<i>reproduction</i> continuum. One can interpret this score while 
staying within the framework of Schoenberg&rsquo;s general intentions about 
<i>Sprechstimme</i> (tending more towards the <i>interaction</i> side of the continuum in 
relation to the instruments), as well as what one may reconstruct as 
Schoenberg&rsquo;s more local intentions (in 1940 or at any other period). Perhaps the 
greatness of this composition is that at different times, Schoenberg placed 
emphasis on different, and seemingly contradicting aspects, while keeping the 
larger spirit of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> in relation to the whole ensemble.<sup><a name="FN63REF" href="#FN63" id="footnote63">(63)</a></sup> In 
this regard, <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> offers an endless variety of possibilities and

March 1911 in the way she selected the poems into three groups according to 
subject. He also preserved her notion of &ldquo;crafting a poetic narrative out of 
Giraud&rsquo;s loosely organized verses&rdquo; (Simms, <i>The Atonal Music</i>, 124). Although 
he created his own new narrative from the poems, he did retain Zehme&rsquo;s

Albertine Zehme&rsquo;s performance was characterized as fluctuating appropriately 
between &lsquo;pathos and parody,&rsquo; thus avoiding the reproach of mannerism (<i>National Zeitung,</i> Oct. 11, 1912), from another point of view an absolute &lsquo;unculture of 
speaking&rsquo; was ascribed to her (R. L-s., <i>M&uuml;ncher Neueste Nachrichten,</i> Nov. 7, 
1912). Marya Freund, who was the reciter in performances under Darius Milhaud in 
France and England and&mdash;according to Milhaud&mdash;tended all too much toward 
singing, was criticized for this in numerous reviews. Others, however, among 
then Vuillermoz (<i>Le Temps</i>, </i>Jan. 27, 1922) and Koechlin (<i>Le Monde Musical</i>,</i> 
Feb. 13, 1922), assessed her performance of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> positively. 
Koechlin even characterized the glissando which she produced thereby as &lsquo;souplesse 
singuli&egrave;re.&rdquo; (Klaus Kropfinger, &ldquo;<i>Pierrot lunaire</i>: Some aspects of its 
reception,&rdquo; in <i>From Pierrot to Marteau</i> (Los Angeles, California: University of

March 1911 in the way she selected the poems into three groups according to 
subject. He also preserved her notion of &ldquo;crafting a poetic narrative out of 
Giraud&rsquo;s loosely organized verses&rdquo; (Simms, <i>The Atonal Music</i>, 124). Although 
he created his own new narrative from the poems, he did retain Zehme&rsquo;s

Albertine Zehme&rsquo;s performance was characterized as fluctuating appropriately 
between &lsquo;pathos and parody,&rsquo; thus avoiding the reproach of mannerism (<i>National Zeitung,</i> Oct. 11, 1912), from another point of view an absolute &lsquo;unculture of 
speaking&rsquo; was ascribed to her (R. L-s., <i>M&uuml;ncher Neueste Nachrichten,</i> Nov. 7, 
1912). Marya Freund, who was the reciter in performances under Darius Milhaud in 
France and England and&mdash;according to Milhaud&mdash;tended all too much toward 
singing, was criticized for this in numerous reviews. Others, however, among 
then Vuillermoz (<i>Le Temps</i>, </i>Jan. 27, 1922) and Koechlin (<i>Le Monde Musical</i>,</i> 
Feb. 13, 1922), assessed her performance of the <i>Sprechstimme</i> positively. 
Koechlin even characterized the glissando which she produced thereby as &lsquo;souplesse 
singuli&egrave;re.&rdquo; (Klaus Kropfinger, &ldquo;<i>Pierrot lunaire</i>: Some aspects of its
