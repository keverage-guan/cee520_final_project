<!-------------------------------- ARTICLE BODY (begin) -------------------------------------->

<p>[1] The invitation I received last fall to participate in this millennial panel requested that I address the topic of
how &ldquo;music
theory goes outside the canon.&rdquo; Although I had never considered myself a specialist in this emerging area of research, I am happy
to be associated with it because I believe music theory&rsquo;s current vibrancy can be attributed to our profession&rsquo;s welcoming of a
diversity of thinking about topics of study and methods of analysis, a trend that I hope will become a fixture
in the new millennium.</p>
<p>[<a name="2">2</a>] Because the six papers delivered at the 1997 SMT special session &ldquo;Music Theory: Practices and Prospects&rdquo; (two of which
were given by my plenary session colleague Patrick McCreless and our session chair Janet
Schmalfeldt) reflected upon directions
music theory has taken over the past decade and were subsequently published in <i>Music Theory
Online</i>, my contribution to today&rsquo;s collective gaze into music theory&rsquo;s future will begin by
surveying its very recent past&mdash;since 1997&mdash;as marked by its analytical ventures outside the
canon.<sup><a name="FN1REF" href="#FN1" id="footnote1">(1)</a></sup> After assessing music theory&rsquo;s present
attitude toward non-canonical music, I
will argue that the profession has demonstrated a real interest in scholarship that tackles topics previously marginalized or absent
altogether in the music-theoretical literature. This professional encouragement can be measured by conference program committees&rsquo;
acceptance of papers and panels that explore new topics and offer fresh approaches; publishers&rsquo; and editors&rsquo; active pursuit of
writings that expand the analytical canon; and an interest by search committees in candidates who can teach in areas outside of
the Western European art music canon as well as the standard tonal and post-tonal repertoire.
Using a single case study, I will suggest that the field of music theory presents encouraging
possibilities for those who wish to build a professional life outside the canon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[3] The appended bibliography represents the remarkable diversity of the methods and musics engaged by theorists over the past
three years and includes conference papers, articles, and books on topics as eclectic as bebop, soul, pop, rock, music by women,
American music,
and music of Africa, Bali, and Java. These writings have introduced new possibilities for understanding a rich assortment
of music. To highlight a few examples: Susan Fast explores how gender and sexuality are
represented in the music and visual iconography of Led Zeppelin; Shaugn O&rsquo;Donnell considers musical
metaphors in relation to the Grateful Dead; and David Temperley examines syncopation in examples by the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac,
Marvin Gaye, Spin Doctors, and Pearl Jam within a theory of meter. Thanks
to SMT&rsquo;s embracing of new perspectives, facilitated by the efforts of its past presidents including
Janet, Pat, and Joe Straus, the Society has nurtured work in pop and jazz, and interdisciplinary work in feminist theory, gender
studies, philosophy, cognition, and critical theory. An astounding five panels at the 1999
SMT meeting were devoted exclusively to topics organized by so-called &ldquo;special interest
groups&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Gamelan Theories, Western Theories</i>, organized by the SMT Committee on Diversity; a special session on Italian feminist
theory organized by the SMT&rsquo;s Committee on the Status of Women; <i>Music Theory and
Queer Issues</i>, organized by the newly minted SMT Gay and Lesbian Discussion Group;
<i>Timbre and Technology in
Rock and Rap</i>, organized by the equally new SMT Popular Music Group; and <i>Ellington: The First One Hundred
Years</i>, organized by
the SMT Jazz Theory and Analysis Group. Papers in general sessions also contributed to this healthy opening up of the
canon&mdash;keynote addresses by Willie Anku on rhythm in African music and by Jose Luis
Martinez on art music of India, Karim Al-Zand&rsquo;s paper on improvisation in Cannonball Adderley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Straight,
No Chaser,&rdquo; Robert Morris&rsquo;s examination of variation and process in south Indian music, Walter Everett&rsquo;s study of harmony in the
music of Steely Dan, and Timothy Koozin&rsquo;s investigation of structural and thematic aspects of Sarah McLachlan&rsquo;s
music. Publications will, I trust, eventually blossom from these initial
conference offerings. The music theory community should be rightly proud of the stimulating array of topics and
methodologies spun out in Atlanta.</p>
<p>[<a name="4">4</a>] While this overview of recent scholarship presented at conferences and published in books confirmed my sense of music
theory&rsquo;s increasing inclusivity, it also showed that the canon dominates one significant body of writings: music theory
journals. A survey of articles published since 1997 in <i>Music Theory Spectrum</i>,
<i>Journal of Music Theory</i>, <i>Music Analysis</i>, <i>Perspectives of New
Music</i>, <i>Music Theory Online</i>, <i>Int&eacute;gral</i>, and <i>Indiana Theory
Review</i> turned up many studies of works by canonical composers: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, J. S. and C. P. E.
Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Berg, Schumann, Boulez, Ligeti, Messiaen, Wagner, Brahms, Liszt, Beethoven, Debussy,
Bruckner, Jan&aacute;cek,
Prokofiev, Bart&oacute;k, Schubert, and Webern. Eric F. Clarke&rsquo;s article in a recent issue of <i>Music Analysis</i> 
is unusual on three counts: it discusses popular music, music by the
difficult-to-pigeonhole composer Frank Zappa, and music by a woman, P. J.
Harvey.<sup><a name="FN2REF" href="#FN2" id="footnote2">(2)</a></sup> Not only is there still a pressing need
in the new millennium for our music theory societies to diversify their membership
with regard to gender and race, but music theory journals also need to publish scholarship on music by women,
popular music and jazz, American music, and non-Western music on a much larger scale. I am not suggesting that research on
canonical composers should be dispensed with; I am saying that music theory journals need to become more diverse. When included in
such journals, research outside the canon of Western European art music is legitimized as serious and
necessary scholarly work, and can lead to recognition in the form of awards by our professional
societies, which in turn helps younger and independent scholars get a boost on the job market and eventually to gain tenure. As
the editor of an academic newsletter,<sup><a name="FN3REF" href="#FN3" id="footnote3">(3)</a></sup> I am only too well aware
of the difficulty in securing such contributions&mdash;good work has often been promised to another editor, the work is not ready to
be published, and so forth&mdash;but to say it simply, and to say it again: we must and can do better.</p>
<p>[5] Speaking about music theory as a profession brings me to my next topic: I would like to address the question of whether
choosing to &ldquo;walk on the wild side&rdquo; with the music of Lou Reed, Cibo Matto, Kaija Saariaho, Sting, Mary Lou Williams, Koo Nimo,
or Adam Guettel rather than with Bach, Beethoven, Berg, or Boulez will result in one&rsquo;s exclusion from scholarly circles and
academic delegitimization. Because time did not permit me to conduct a survey on these
issues with a statistically significant population, I decided instead to share with you my own experience
as a case study. I will first briefly sketch some of the approaches I have used to address two non-canonical areas of
research&mdash;music by American women composers and popular music of the past three decades&mdash;and I will then consider the ways that
such work fits into the profession.</p>
<p>[6] In writing a book on the twentieth-century American women composers Ruth Crawford, Marion Bauer, and Miriam Gideon, I
wanted to develop a branch of music theory that is markedly feminist; this impulse led me to consider elements not typically
embedded within the fabric of music analysis.<sup><a name="FN4REF" href="#FN4" id="footnote4">(4)</a></sup> Situating
compositions within their historical, political, and social contexts, <i>Gendering Musical
Modernism</i> presents close readings that recognize the impact of the composer&rsquo;s gender, politics, and
social views on the music itself; relates pieces to specific incidents in the composer&rsquo;s life that occurred at roughly the
time of composition; and links narratives in the pieces to the composer&rsquo;s identity as projected in her writings and in
reflections by her contemporaries. My analyses of Crawford&rsquo;s String Quartet, movements 3 and 4, Bauer&rsquo;s Toccata for piano,
Gideon&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Night Is My Sister&rdquo; for voice and string trio and her duo for violin
and piano entitled &ldquo;Esther&rdquo; map out a relationship between musical structure and gender-specific events
that recognizes and critically comments upon the inequity of the sexes as experienced by these women. My analyses of Crawford&rsquo;s
song, &ldquo;Chinaman, Laundryman,&rdquo; and Bauer&rsquo;s Chromaticon for piano examine how aspects of identity including the composers&rsquo;
political beliefs and social views may likewise be inscribed in compositional structures. My analyses,
moreover, do not speak with a disembodied authority; they depart from music theory&rsquo;s
traditionally objective stance and are marked by my own identity.</p>
<p>[7] My work in popular music is also interdisciplinary, rooted in a perspective informed by cultural studies, feminist theory,
ethnic studies, and postcolonial theory. Building upon the work of scholars who have brought critical questions about gender,
race, and sexuality to bear on popular music studies, I examine a variety of works from the past three decades with particular
attention to the ways in which cultural politics have been absorbed into popular music, to structural
aspects of individual musical works in relation to their social and cultural contexts,
and to the effects within a larger cultural economy of musical representations on both their intended audiences and those they
represent. One example is my recently published study of a musician whose work I&rsquo;ve admired for nearly
twenty years, the British singer and songwriter Joan Armatrading.<sup><a name="FN5REF" href="#FN5" id="footnote5">(5)</a></sup> I argue that
Armatrading&rsquo;s songs convey a female experience as it has been shaped by her own identity, including her gender, race, and
sexuality; and that her identity, frequently conveyed in encoded forms, can be uncovered through close readings of
both the musical structure of her songs and their lyrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[8] During the years that I was on the job market seeking a tenure- track position in music theory, I found that, by and
large, choice of a research topic alone did not usually exclude candidates from consideration&mdash;in fact, search committees
frequently pursue candidates whose research is off the beaten track. When faced with hundreds of applicants, many of whom seem
to be perfectly qualified for the position, a search committee may very well be attracted to those
candidates who explore non-traditional repertories in imaginative ways. There are, of
course, those people who will not have heard of a composer or group or genre to which you have devoted years of study, and who
may consequently dismiss your research as unimportant. But I am pleased to report that many in my
generation have secured satisfying jobs in which their research is valued, or obtain
their first job by working in more traditionally accepted areas and then turn to alternative genres as post-dissertation
projects.</p>
<p>[9] As an associate editor of <i>Perspectives of New Music</i> and as a member of the editorial boards of
<i>American Music</i>, <i>Women and Music</i>, and the <i>Journal of Popular Music
Studies</i>, I can say with certainty that strong work that presents bold, new perspectives is in demand, and that the editorial boards
with which I have been affiliated seek more diversity in their submissions. I believe that it is crucial that those people who
can have an impact on what is published and who is hired advocate work that presents innovative perspectives. Music theorists who
produce cutting-edge work on lesser known or marginalized repertories must receive our support, encouragement, and
recognition, before we lose an entire generation of scholars to the vagaries of the
academic job market. In the new millennium, we must continue to embrace the opportunity to expand our
analytical horizons, rather than retreating to the safety of name brands.</p>
<p>[10] In his afterword to the 1995 collection, <i>Concert Music, Rock and Jazz Since
1945</i>, Nicholas Cook observes that essays on popular music topics in the book use &ldquo;established concepts in
order to legitimize repertories that have not up to now been taken seriously,&rdquo; and he notes further that
&ldquo;[w]here the legitimacy of the repertory is not in question, you can afford to
be much more adventurous in your approach; you can afford to take risks with the
music.&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN6REF" href="#FN6" id="footnote6">(6)</a></sup> In the context of his comments on my
contribution, an analysis of the third movement of Ruth Crawford&rsquo;s String Quartet, Cook muses: &ldquo;Who knows what Ellie
Hisama could do with Beethoven?&rdquo;<sup><a name="FN7REF" href="#FN7" id="footnote7">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p>[11] Cook&rsquo;s friendly invitation has prompted me off and on over the past five years to publish such an analytical study. But I am
still more interested in analyzing the rich body of music that remains
untheorized. By virtue of the increased interest in and tentative acceptance of feminist methodologies and popular music
topics in our field, I&rsquo;m fortunate to have the freedom to work on music outside the analytical canon without feeling obligated to
write on more traditional topics. I hope that in the coming millennium we will continue to branch out by drawing upon
insights from feminist theory, cultural studies, critical theory, ethnic, gender,
and sexuality studies, postcolonial theory, and diaspora studies to invent subfields in music theory that we
haven&rsquo;t yet imagined. As my own experience suggests, it is possible to forge a professional life in music theory through
alternative approaches and repertories&mdash;reason enough, I think, to walk on the wild
side.</p>
